    "speech": "Mr Alvin Tan\n: Mr Speaker, investment platforms operating as digital advisers that manage investment portfolios on behalf of customers are licensed as Capital Markets Services Licensees (CMSLs) under the Securities and Futures Act. They offer portfolios which are invested into funds managed by other licensed fund management companies. These investment platforms are required by regulation to keep customers' assets legally separate and safekept by licensed custodians.\nThe recent incident involving a surge in withdrawals from an investment platform illustrate that the safeguards worked as intended. Customers' assets were properly segregated from the platform and requests for withdrawal were redeemed in an orderly manner, within the standard fund redemption timeframe of three to six working days. Customers received the market value of their investments within the typical three to six days.\nIn the specific case I mentioned above, the investment platform offered two unique features, which they marketed prominently to customers. First, it offered instant withdrawals for customers, up to a limit per account. Second, it allowed customers to spend on a debit card that was linked to the value of their underlying investments. The platform stopped both these features when the high usage of both these features became unsustainable for it to support.\nThe conditions and limitations of these features, including the ability of the investment platform to vary or stop these features, were disclosed in the product terms and conditions. However, these disclosures may not have been effective in providing customers a full understanding of the product.\nWhile product features do not always require regulatory approval, there are regulatory requirements in place for robust risk management and clear disclosures, especially where they impact a firm's operations. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is reviewing this particular case against these requirements, as well as, more generally, how to ensure investment platforms implement these requirements effectively.\nAt the same time, we urge customers to fully understand the features, including key terms and conditions, and risks of a financial product, before deciding to invest in it. Customers should also seek professional financial advice on the suitability of a product if they are unclear of its features. We also encourage customers to refer to our MoneySENSE website to learn more about what to look out for in an investment.\nMr Speaker\n:",

So, I will use that term if it is not already familiar with Members of this House.\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has received eight complaints against finfluencers in 2025, with the majority attributable to comments made recently by two finfluencers who shared their reasons for liquidating their investments from an investment platform. The number of complaints in 2025 is an increase from the average of five complaints per year in the last five years and MAS is monitoring this closely.\nBy and large, finfluencers help create awareness of products and services offered by financial institutions and some play a role in promoting financial literacy. However, they must do so responsibly and must not veer into providing financial advice, which is a regulated activity. MAS considers an individual as providing financial advice if he is remunerated for making a recommendation or expressing an opinion on the buying, selling or holding of investment products. Even if he is not remunerated, MAS considers a finfluencer to have provided financial advice if he makes such recommendations or expressions regularly. A finfluencer providing advice must be regulated under the Financial Advisers Act and must first be appointed as a representative by a licensed financial advisory firm.\nEven if finfluencers are not providing financial advice, they must not make false or misleading statements on any capital markets products, or they may be liable for an offence under the Securities and Futures Act. For example, finfluencers cannot make false or misleading statements to induce others to deal in capital market products such as shares or units in collective investment schemes. This includes any statement made on social media. Finfluencers are also subject to the principles of the Singapore Code of Advertising Practice overseen by the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (ASAS).

    "speaker": "Mr Zaqy Mohamad",
    "speech": "(Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower)\n: Speaker, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) took corrective actions to address the increase in workplace fatalities in the marine sector last year. In October 2024, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), MOM and the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council called on companies in the maritime industry to conduct a Safety Time-Out, with a focus on work activities carried out at anchorages and commercial diving activities. Companies were to review their WSH management systems, reiterate senior management’s focus on safety and refresh workers’ awareness of workplace safety protocols. Companies were also provided with materials on good safety practices and case studies to assist them in mitigating common WSH hazards in the marine sector, such as falling from height and working in confined spaces.\nFor diving activities, which contributed to two out of five of the sector’s fatalities in 2024, MOM has worked with the Commercial Diving Association of Singapore to emphasise to the commercial diving community on the importance of adhering to the code of practice for diving at work. This includes ensuring dive personnel are trained and use proper diving equipment. MPA also reminds applicants seeking a diving permit for commercial diving to adhere to the code of practice, amongst other conditions. To ensure compliance, MOM and MPA conducted a joint enforcement operation from September to December 2024, and will ramp up our enforcement efforts this year.\nWhile we observe that there has been no further fatality in the marine sector in 2025 to date, we will continue to closely monitor the sector’s WSH compliance and improve its WSH performance. Together with MPA and the WSH Council, MOM will be engaging senior management of companies from the marine sector to emphasise the importance of building a strong WSH culture. MOM will also be working with MPA to strengthen safety oversight over the marine sector, including reviewing upstream measures to further tighten diving safety standards, especially on the use of proper diving equipment.

They complete a four-week Basic Rescue Training and a 12-week Fire Fighter Course at the Civil Defence Academy (CDA). Firefighting training at the CDA is conducted with realistic \"live\" fire simulators to provide our firefighters the confidence to operate in real firefighting and rescue incidents. All officers must complete a series of proficiency and certification tests before they can be deployed as firefighters.\nAfter graduating from CDA, training continues to be an integral part of a firefighter’s daily routine.

    "speaker": "Ms Sim Ann",
    "speech": "Ms Sim Ann\n: In 2024, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) assisted Town Councils (TCs) and flat owners with a total of 859 complex water seepage cases. Such cases include water seepage from various sources, such as from the external wall or from the flat above.\nTCs are responsible for the maintenance of the external walls of HDB flats as they are part of common property. Residents who encounter water seepage from external walls in their flat typically report it to the TC managing their estate. Where residents report such cases to HDB, HDB will refer these cases to the respective TC for follow-up. Based on the number of cases that HDB received, it did not observe a surge in March 2025. Notwithstanding, HDB has received feedback from some TCs that the number of external water seepage cases typically increases during the monsoon season. HDB will continue to support TCs in resolving these cases.\nFor complex cases involving external wall seepage, each HDB Zone’s dedicated team for handling repairs management will support TCs by conducting joint inspections and providing technical advice so that TCs can identify the root causes and carry out repairs expeditiously. This is typically within one week after the TC approaches HDB, subject to the availability of the flat owner and TC staff.\nIt is important for TCs to build up expertise in dealing with external wall seepage. To support this, HDB has been conducting regular training for TCs and has made available a training video on the diagnosis and repair of external wall seepage to further level up TC staff’s technical competency.\nFlat owners are responsible for the maintenance of the interior of their flats, including the repair of leaks in the shared structure between units. HDB assists flat owners in resolving ceiling leaks through the Goodwill Repair Assistance scheme, where HDB pays 50% of the ceiling leak repair cost, while the remaining 50% is shared equally between the upper- and lower-floor flat owners.\nHDB is constantly on the look-out for better and more effective maintenance methods and equipment. For example, HDB is working with industry partners and research institutes to develop better ways to address maintenance issues, especially those encountered in our older estates. This includes an ongoing trial at 70 flats island-wide on the use of better scanning technology which has the capability to scan through concrete to detect causes of seepage. Similar to an x-ray machine, this allows the inspection team to see beneath the surface and trace the root cause of the seepage. HDB will then monitor and assess if the technology can be scaled up for widespread use, including use by TCs to more effectively diagnose and resolve more complex water seepage cases upfront. If the trial is successful, HDB will share more details on the plans to scale up.\nMr Speaker\n:",

But one of the key focus of the task force is going to be in terms of communication and information sharing.\nWe will be engaging the private sector, so that is why the Prime Minister announced that the composition will include private sector representatives. The idea is to gather information from the ground, understand the challenges that are faced by the enterprises on the ground and to also discuss with them how we can lean forward to support them, to help them navigate through these uncharted waters as we move ahead under this new landscape.\nWe also will include union representatives, because we do expect that jobs may be affected. It may not be immediately, but I think, in the medium to longer term. I think there will be a major restructure of the economy that will result in the restructure of the workforce as well. And I think, as the Prime Minister emphasised, the focus on training is always the key to our transformation journey and therefore, unions and employers and enterprises will play a key role.\nAs I said many times before, our main guiding principle is really to be as transparent as possible.

    "speaker": "Ms Indranee Rajah",
    "speech": "(Ms Indranee Rajah)\n: Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to make this clarification on the Housing and Development Board's (HDB's) policy for rental housing applicants undergoing divorce.\nDuring the debate on the Motion on Supporting Singaporeans in Starting and Raising Families on 5 February 2025, Mr Faisal Manap sought a clarification on whether HDB would allow parents who are undergoing divorce and in urgent need of housing to apply for public rental housing before the divorce is finalised. [\nPlease refer to \"Supporting Singaporeans in Starting and Raising Families\", Official Report, 5 February 2025, Vol 95, Issue 151, Motions section.\n]\nI had replied that HDB does already allow individuals who have commenced divorce proceedings to apply for rental housing even before the interim or final judgments are obtained.\nThe Leader of the Opposition then sought a further clarification, quoting a letter his constituent had received from HDB, which stated that HDB would not be able to consider an applicant's application if they have not obtained a deed of separation or when their divorce is not finalised, and highlighted that the latter part of that sentence did not appear to be consistent with my reply.\nIn response, I said that for rental housing applicants, HDB takes a case-by-case approach, the deed of separation would enable an application to be made before the interim or final judgment was issued, and that I would review whether HDB's procedures can be more facilitative.\nI have since checked the specific case and the letter referred to by Mr Pritam Singh, and would like to provide a clarification for the record.\nFirst, I would like to confirm that my response to Mr Faisal's clarification was correct. That is to say, individuals who have commenced divorce proceedings can apply for rental housing before interim and final judgments are obtained. This is, of course, subject to the usual rental housing criteria, such as having no family support or other housing options.\nIn general, HDB requires legally binding documentation showing that ancillary matters, mainly the division of assets and the care and control of children, have been settled before they will accept applications for a public rental flat. This is so that HDB can assess the applicant's eligibility for and ability to afford their housing options.\nIn most cases, the interim judgment would settle the ancillary matters. So, if an interim judgment contains orders on the relevant ancillary matters, HDB will accept that. This is before the final order of divorce is issued.\nHowever, HDB will consider applications even before the interim judgment if: first, the ancillary matters have been settled in a deed of separation, which typically takes place before an interim judgment; or second, on a case-by-case basis, if there is urgent need, an applicant's appeal to HDB via a social worker, so there is a proper assessment of the applicant's circumstances.\nIn the specific case referred by Mr Pritam Singh, the appeal letter stated that the couple was separated but had not yet filed for divorce. This means that there were no pending proceedings and hence, no interim judgment. Hence, the applicable exceptions would have been either by submitting a deed of separation or to make an appeal on the basis on urgent need via a social worker, both of which can be done before an interim judgment is obtained.\nIn the reply of 3 May 2024, which is the letter Mr Pritam Singh referred to, setting out when it was prepared to consider the application for a rental flat, HDB referred to the deed of separation, which is correct, but it also inadvertently and incorrectly referred to finalisation of divorce and finalised divorce documents. It should have referred to an interim judgment with provisions on ancillary matters instead.\nIn this case, I understand that HDB had been working with the appellant's social worker to obtain the necessary documents and information, but the input provided was insufficient for HDB's assessment. Hence, HDB was not able to accede to the appeal.\nHDB understands, through the social worker, that the divorce was recently made final but without any reference to ancillary arrangements. However, the appellant has since told HDB that they intend to apply for a BTO flat. We have nonetheless advised the social worker to approach HDB again if they are in urgent housing need.\nMr Speaker\n:",

    "section_title": "The Government's Position on the Presumptions under the Misuse of Drugs Act",
    "speaker": "Mr K Shanmugam",
    "speech": "(Mr K Shanmugam)\n: Sir, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim\n1\nhas filed a Parliamentary Question for the Sitting on or after 14 April this year, asking whether the Government has any plans to introduce amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), in relation to the presumptions under the Act.\nMr Zhulkarnain’s question would not have come up for this Sitting. But given the importance of the matter he has raised, I have decided to make a Ministerial Statement.\nThere is a case pending before the Courts challenging the presumptions. Thus, we have to be careful on what we say in this House. I will, for my part, only set out the Government's policy positions, which has been stated publicly in the past. The law, as it stands now, is based on current policy. The Government has seen no reason to introduce any amendments with regard to those presumptions.\nThe MDA presumptions date back to the enactment of the MDA itself in 1973. They were debated in Parliament. This Parliament has also discussed the issue, most recently, during the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill in 2023. The amendment Bill was passed unanimously.\nWhy are the presumptions in drug cases necessary? It is essentially to protect Singapore from drug trafficking.\nThe MDA presumptions deal with the practical challenges in proving certain facts that are often exclusively within the accused person's knowledge or which it would not be practical for the Prosecution to get direct evidence of. For example, the Prosecution will be able to prove that the drugs were in the accused person's possession. But it would be very easy for the accused to claim that he did not know they were drugs and by that way try and avoid conviction. And if he runs that defence, then it may not be easy for the Prosecution to rebut that claim or go get the necessary evidence to prove that the accused was indeed aware that they were drugs. For example, the evidence may be overseas and often quite elusive.\nTherefore, the presumptions deal with the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs.\nUnder the MDA, the onus is on the accused to prove that he did not know that what was found to be in his possession were drugs – and these are usually facts within his knowledge.\nThe Prosecution must first prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the drugs were in the accused person’s possession. That will then trigger the presumption of knowledge. Also, the Prosecution must still prove all the other elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.\nLet me cite a few examples I gave in 2017, when I spoke in Parliament about the evidential difficulties in drug cases and the necessity of the legal presumptions. These were the examples I gave, amongst several.\nFirst was, I quote what I then said: “A person was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint. He has got 145 grammes of diamorphine. He said he travelled to Kuala Lumpur to look for job opportunities. He was introduced to a man known as 'Uncle'. 'Uncle' then passed him 10 packets of substances and taped these on to his body. This chap then claimed he asked 'Uncle' what they were for, but 'Uncle' showed him three fingers in reply. And he accepted it. He was not aware of the contents and he came here.”\nAnd I went on to say how can the Prosecution rebut this? The truth is only in the person’s mind. “This is why our first Prime Minister, who was a lawyer, knew what the problems would be and reversed the onus of proof.”\nLet me give you another example, again, from the same speech: \"[there was a] chap, convicted in 2008. He was asked by one 'Maren' to deliver items in Singapore. He was told that it was medicine. He was told that it was rare and expensive, that it was wrapped up so that it could not be spoilt by coming into contact with air. And so he went to Johor, met 'Maren' and brought it over. You want CNB to disprove this? You think it is possible? Or do you think it is fair that the accused should prove it?”\nAs I said, \"[w]e are dealing with lives here. The life of a trafficker, yes. But we are also dealing with thousands of Singaporean lives. And the person must get a fair trial. Prosecution must prove what was the substance, how much was it, and possession, and any other evidence that they can find. If the person has a defence, it is only fair that he proves it.\"\nSir, that was what I said here in 2017. That has been the position in law since 1973.\nWhile many other countries have faced huge difficulties in combating drugs, Singapore has been able to maintain one of the lowest rates of drug abuse in the world. That is despite the worsening global drug situation and our location at the doorstep of the Golden Triangle, one of the world’s leading areas for the production of illicit drugs. I went into detail on this just last year in my Ministerial Statement on Singapore’s national drug control policy.\nThe presumptions have been an essential part of the legal framework that enables us to deal effectively with the drug problem.\nSir, to conclude, as I said earlier, the Government has no plans to introduce any amendments as yet with regard to the presumptions, as the law now stands.\nMr Zhulkarnain’s question may have arisen by reason of a specific challenge before the Courts, which I referred to earlier. I can say that the Government will defend the constitutionality of the presumptions. We should be careful not to discuss the specifics of any challenge. That is for the Courts to decide.\nMr Speaker\n:",

    "section_title": "US Tariffs and Implications",
    "speaker": "Mr Lawrence Wong",
    "speech": "(Mr Lawrence Wong)\n: Mr Speaker, we have known for some time that the world is in flux. The familiar signposts are fading, but the contours of a new global system have yet to take shape. We are in a period of transition – uncertain, unsettled and increasingly unstable.\nThe recent \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcements by the United States (US) confirms this stark reality – the era of rules-based globalisation and free trade is over.\nThis marks a profound turning point. We are entering a new phase in global affairs – one that is more arbitrary, protectionist and dangerous.\nFor nearly 80 years since the end of World War II, America was the anchor for the free market economies of the world. It championed free trade and open markets, and led efforts to build a multilateral trading system. This World Trade Organization (WTO) system ushered in decades of global growth and stability. It allowed trade to flourish and lifted millions out of poverty. It benefited the world and contributed to America's own economic strength.\nObjectively, America continues to enjoy unrivalled economic heft. In fact, the US rebounded more quickly than other advanced economies from the COVID-19 pandemic. It has surged ahead of all its major competitors in the advanced industrial world.\nBut not all Americans feel this way about their economy. There are hollowed-out towns in what was once America's thriving industrial belt. There are workers whose jobs have disappeared and whose incomes have stagnated. They believe that the American economy is fundamentally broken.\nDiscontent was already visible in the 1990s when protestors disrupted the WTO meeting in Seattle. Frustrations deepened following the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and more recently, after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo be clear, the global economic system is in need of reform. Singapore and many others have called for changes, and we have been working with like-minded partners at the WTO to reform its processes.\nA key concern in America is China – the sense that the US had given away too much in allowing China to join the WTO and that China competes on an unfair basis, for example, by heavily subsidising its own companies, putting up non-tariff barriers and restricting market access to US firms.\nThese concerns should be addressed within the WTO framework. In particular, the trade arrangements and concessions made in the past when China was only 5% of the world's economy should be updated when China now makes up 15% of the world's gross domestic product (GDP). And if there are disagreements, they should be resolved through the WTO's dispute settlement system, which has been paralysed and urgently needs to be restored and reformed.\nBut what the US is doing now is not reform. It is rejecting the very system it created.\nThe US has imposed a blanket 10% tariff on imports for nearly all countries. On top of that, it has layered on higher tariffs, up to 50%, for selected countries, especially those that run a trade surplus with the US. According to the administration, the sweeping tariffs are needed to fix America's trade imbalances.\nBut there is nothing inherently wrong about running a trade deficit. It simply means that American consumers are buying more from the world than the world is buying from America. Moreover, the focus has been solely on the goods trade. That only gives a partial picture. In fact, the US runs a surplus with many of its trading partners in services, exporting software services, education, entertainment, financial and business services. But this fact has been completely ignored.\nIn Singapore's case, we have a free trade agreement (FTA) with America. We impose zero tariffs on US imports and we actually run a trade deficit with the US – meaning we buy more from them than they do from us. If the tariffs were truly reciprocal and if they were meant to target only those with trade surpluses, then the tariff for Singapore should be zero. But still, we are being subjected to the 10% tariff. We are very disappointed by the US move, especially considering the deep and long-standing friendship between our two countries. These are not actions one does to a friend.\nAsia bears the brunt of the US tariff increase. Within the region, China is the hardest hit, facing a 34% tariff in this round. This is on top of the 20% tariff increase imposed over the past two months and the 20% from the first Trump administration. Taken together, the average US tariff on Chinese products now exceeds 60%.\nIn Southeast Asia, the tariff rates range from 10% to 49%.\nThese measures will accelerate the fracturing of the global economy. Instead of flowing based on economic efficiency, capital and trade will increasingly be diverted based on political alignment and security considerations.\nSeveral Members have asked about the impact of the tariffs on specific industries in Singapore. We are assessing the situation carefully. But our deeper worry is not the direct impact that these businesses face. It is the wider implications for the global trading system and the world economy. Let me explain.\nFirst, the \"reciprocal\" tariffs are a fundamental rejection of the WTO rules. One of the cornerstones of the WTO multilateral trading system is the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) principle. Most Favoured Nation sounds like giving special privileges. Actually, it means the opposite – that every member must treat all other members equally. In other words, if a country extends more favourable terms or imposes additional restrictions to one trading partner, it must do the same to all other WTO members.\nThere are some carve-outs and exceptions to the MFN rule, for example, to allow FTAs. But MFN has long been the bedrock of the multilateral trading system. It ensures a level playing field, prevents discrimination and enables countries, big and small, to compete fairly in global markets.\nThis has helped to liberalise trade amongst more than 100 WTO members, each with different economic and political and social concerns.\nAmerica's new tariff regime is a complete repudiation of the MFN principle. It opens the door to selective country-by-country trade relationships, based on unilateral preferences.\nIf other countries adopt the same approach as the US, the rules-based trading system will unravel. This will spell trouble for all nations. But smaller countries, like Singapore, will face more pressures because small countries have very limited bargaining power in one-on-one bilateral negotiations. So, the major powers will dictate the terms and we risk being marginalised and sidelined.\nSecond, the likelihood of a full-blown global trade war is growing. Singapore has decided not to impose retaliatory tariffs. Doing so will only lead to increased costs for Singaporeans. But other countries may not be guided by the same considerations and may have different perceptions and views.\nChina has already imposed retaliatory tariffs on US goods. Others, like the European Union, are considering their next steps.\nSome think that the new tariffs are a negotiating tactic, a negotiating tool by the US to extract concessions in other areas. This was what President Richard Nixon did in 1971. He slapped a 10% surcharge on imports to pressure Germany and Japan to devalue their currencies and when they did, the tariffs came off.\nIndeed, there is a brief window for countries to negotiate and get some reprieve from the US before their higher tariff rates take effect and it may be possible for some rates to be lowered. But we have to be realistic. Once trade barriers go up, they tend to stay up. Rolling them back is much harder, even after the original rationale no longer applies.\nEven if some partial accommodations are eventually worked out, the uncertainty generated by such a drastic move will dampen global confidence and growth. It will be very hard to restore the previous status quo. And in particular, it does not look like the 10% universal rate is open for negotiation. This seems to be the fixed minimum tariff, regardless of a country's trade balance or existing trade arrangements.\nFurthermore, there are other forces that could maintain the momentum for tariffs. In particular, many European countries are eager to protect their critical industries, like electric vehicles (EVs), green technologies and semi-conductors, from Chinese competition. They do not want to become a dumping ground for exports from China or other countries.\nThere is also a growing push across the West to strengthen their domestic manufacturing capabilities and to reduce dependence on global supply chains, especially in strategic industries.\nSo, this round of tariff increases by the US may just be the beginning of more increases to come globally. And we have seen this play out before. The US enacted sweeping tariff increases through the Smoot-Hawley Act in 1930. Many countries protested and a number retaliated with their own trade restrictions and tariffs. This deepened and extended the Great Depression.\nIn some ways, today's risks may be greater. The new US tariffs, if fully enacted, are higher than the ones in Smoot-Hawley. Trade is now a much bigger part of the American and global economy compared to the 1930s. Supply chains are also more deeply interconnected than they were back then. Any disruption to trade flows will have wider knock-on effects on the world.\nThis brings me to the third point, which is the impact on the global economy.\nBusiness and consumer confidence has already been hit by the tariffs. International trade and investments will suffer. Our economic agencies got in touch with several multinational enterprises (MNEs) and local businesses after the tariff announcement. Even those who are not directly affected by the tariffs are worried about weakening demand from their consumers. Some have put new projects on hold while they assess the full implications of the tariffs.\nThese are reactions from companies based here. But I am sure similar conversations are happening in board rooms elsewhere.\nOver the recent days, we have seen sharp negative reactions in global stock markets. It is too early to tell is all these will spill over into the real economy. But the downside risks are clearly rising. What is troubling is not just the tariffs themselves, which are already damaging, but the fact that this new wave of protectionism is unpredictable and unstable. Protectionism is already bad. Unstable protectionism is even worse.\nBusinesses do not know what to expect. Many are holding back, fearful that changing rules will leave them with stranded assets. And all these create an environment of deep uncertainty, one that could tip both the US and the global economy into recession.\nThe consequences extend far beyond economics. More and more countries are turning away from win-win cooperation and deeper integration. Instead, we see a rising \"me first\", win-lose mindset, where it is every country for itself. Some are even prepared to use aggressive or coercive means to get what they want at the expense of others.\nMeanwhile, global institutions are getting weaker and long-standing norms of cooperation are breaking down.\nOne major concern is the US-China relationship. America views China as a strategic competitor and threat, which must be dealt with now while America still has the advantage. China says it is ready for a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war. The US has now threatened an additional 50% tariff on China and China says it will fight till the end. There are fewer channels for dialogue, which can serve as guardrails to manage the relationship. So, if the disputes escalate and destabilise US-China relations, the consequences for the world would be disastrous.\nWe must be mentally prepared. The predictable and rules-based order we once knew is fading. The new era will be more volatile, with more frequent and unpredictable shocks. We must be ready to stand firm and protect our interests, no matter how the external winds may blow.\nWhat does all this mean for Singapore?\nIn the near term, we expect weaker global growth, which means external demand for our goods and services will fall. The outward-oriented sectors of our economy will suffer the brunt of the impact. They include, manufacturing, especially segments like electronic and semi-conductors; biomedical science, which have higher exposure to the US; wholesale trade; and transport – these will be impacted. The global uncertainty and dampened sentiments will also impact some services industries, including finance and insurance.\nSingapore may or may not go into recession this year. But I have no doubt that our growth will be significantly impacted. We had originally projected GDP growth of 1% to 3% for 2025. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) is reassessing the growth forecast and will likely revise it downwards.\nSlower growth will mean fewer job opportunities and smaller wage increases for workers. And if more companies face difficulties or relocate their operations back to the US, there will be higher retrenchments and job losses.\nFor now, the measures announced in this year's Budget will provide support for any short-term strain. We have a comprehensive package of measures for households and individuals. They will receive the Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers, SG60 Vouchers and U-Save rebates to help with their cost of living. And there are also targeted measures, like increased ComCare Assistance, for the more vulnerable groups.\nWe are also supporting workers through investments in SkillsFuture. And those who find themselves involuntarily unemployed will receive help to get back on their feet through the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme which will start later this month.\nWe have also rolled out various measures in the Budget to help businesses. There are short-term support measures through corporate income tax rebates, as well as schemes to boost their productivity and competitiveness, and to pivot to new markets. Our economic agencies are also engaging the firms impacted by the tariffs to better understand their responses and see how we can support them and assist them with any specific issues they face.\nNevertheless, the situation is fluid and can change quickly. We will, therefore, set up a task force chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong to help businesses and workers address the immediate uncertainties, strengthen their resilience and better adapt to the new economic environment. In addition to our economic agencies, the task force will include the Singapore Business Federation, the Singapore National Employers Federation and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC).\nWe will continue to monitor developments closely. The Government stands ready to do more, if and when necessary. We have the resources to do so because of the financial discipline and prudence we have exercised over the decades.\nIn this new environment, Singapore must redouble our efforts to remain a key node in global flows and a trusted business hub. We will forge closer ties with like-minded partners who share our commitment to open and free trade.\nThe US may have decided to turn protectionist, but the rest of the world does not have to follow the same path. We will identify other partners to join us and work around this, to ensure resilience and maintain critical parts of the multilateral system, while laying the foundations for a possible new and different global system that can be achievable later.\nAnd this is why I have made the effort to engage and visit my counterparts in different countries. I touched base with the United Kingdom's Prime Minister Keir Starmer yesterday and have a few more conversations lined up in the coming weeks. They are all keen to do more with Singapore and to expand our economic cooperation, including in new areas in the digital and green economies.\nIn particular, we will strengthen our collaboration and integration within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Last Friday, I spoke with the Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Malaysia is also the ASEAN Chair this year. We agreed to accelerate ASEAN's integration efforts to make our region more attractive and competitive.\nA Special ASEAN Economic Ministers' Meeting will be convened later this week. They will discuss further ways that ASEAN can work together to strengthen intra-ASEAN Trade and to send a strong signal of ASEAN's commitment to regional economic integration. As a group, ASEAN will also continue to strengthen our links with like-minded partners in areas of mutual interest.\nMr Speaker, we are entering a changed world. The only way Singapore can make it through the gathering storm is to stay united, pool our resources, our resilience and our resolve.\nThe Government will do everything we can to steer Singapore through the choppy waters and make sure no one is left behind. We will keep our economy open, our society cohesive and our institutions strong. We will create new value propositions for businesses and investors. We will act boldly and decisively, when needed, to ensure Singapore continues to succeed.\nAbove all, we will put the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans at the centre of everything we do. The road ahead will be harder. The dangers are real, but so, too, is our determination.\nIn many ways, we are in a better position than we were 60 years ago when we became independent. We have built deep reserves as a strategic buffer. We have forged a strong compact, built on solidarity and trust in each other. And most of all, we have our ingenuity and wit, our grit and gumption – a never say die spirit that has seen us through every crisis, and will carry us through the ones to come.\nSo, Mr Speaker, I say to this House and to fellow Singaporeans: do not fear. Now, more than ever, we will stay resolute and united. Our little red dot will continue to shine. In a dark and troubled world, Singapore will hold our ground as a beacon of stability, purpose and hope.

    "section_title": "Anti-Money Laundering and Other Matters (Estate Agents and Developers) Bill",
    "speaker": "Ms Indranee Rajah",
    "speech": "(Ms Indranee Rajah)\n: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\nSir, as a reputable and trusted financial centre and business hub, Singapore takes a firm stance against money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing.\nIn the real estate sector, estate agents, salespersons and developers play an important role in detecting and deterring illicit activities, alongside financial institutions, lawyers, and law practice entities.\nOver the years, we have established a robust risk management framework for the real estate sector, guided by the recommendations made by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). FATF sets international standards to tackle money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing.\nThis Bill is part of our continuing efforts to bolster our ability to detect and deter such illicit activities within the real estate sector, thereby reinforcing our commitment to stamp out the laundering of criminal proceeds and financing of illicit activities through Singapore. Specifically, this Bill seeks to: (a) strengthen current penalty frameworks; (b) further align our regulatory regime with FATF standards; and (c) make miscellaneous amendments to clarify restrictions against convicted persons.\nI will take Members through the key amendments in these three key areas.\nThe first set of amendments strengthens our penalty frameworks to strengthen the deterrent effect of our current regime.\nToday, estate agents and salespersons are required to perform duties in relation to countering money laundering and terrorism financing activities. Examples include the requirement to conduct customer due diligence (CDD) measures by salespersons on their clients.\nCurrently, non-compliant estate agents and salespersons may be subject to a financial penalty of up to $5,000 per case under the Council for Estate Agencies’ (CEA’s) Letter of Censure disciplinary regime for minor breaches. Estate agents and salespersons who commit more serious breaches may face disciplinary action before a Disciplinary Committee, which is an independent tribunal comprising members from CEA’s Disciplinary Panel. These members are from various backgrounds such as practising solicitors, architects, engineers or individuals from the real estate agency industry.\nThe Disciplinary Committee may impose a financial penalty of up to $200,000 per case on estate agents or $100,000 per case on salespersons.\nHowever, the current penalty framework which allows financial penalties to be imposed on a per case basis does not provide sufficient deterrence. This is because the potential monetary benefits that estate agents and salespersons might obtain for facilitating illicit transactions could be significantly higher than the maximum financial penalty of $200,000 for estate agents, or $100,000 for salespersons.\nIn the recent $3 billion money laundering case, the total estimated value of properties seized was more than $370 million from the 10 convicted offenders. Assuming that a salesperson facilitates the sale of one such property valued at, say, $10 million, a 2% commission for such a transaction would amount to $200,000. When such financial gains far exceed the current maximum penalties for these offences, there is a clear need to raise the penalties for stronger deterrence.\nTo ensure that our penalty frameworks are sufficiently deterrent, clauses 8 and 9 of the Bill will amend the Estate Agents Act to impose maximum financial penalties on a per contravention basis.\nEstate agents and salespersons who contravene any legislation or provision of a code of practice, ethics and conduct relating to money laundering, terrorism financing or proliferation financing, will now be subjected to a maximum penalty of up to $5,000 per contravention under CEA’s Letter of Censure regime. For cases heard by the Disciplinary Committee, errant estate agents and salespersons will be subjected to a maximum penalty of up to $200,000 and $100,000 per contravention for estate agents and salespersons respectively. Maximum penalties for other disciplinary breaches will remain on a per case basis.\nLet me illustrate the changes with a hypothetical example. Assume an errant salesperson has committed four disciplinary breaches that are referred to a Disciplinary Committee to be heard. Of these breaches, two concern anti-money laundering obligations and the other two concern the salesperson’s negligence in handling a transaction. Based on the existing penalty framework, the maximum financial penalty that can be imposed for all four breaches is $100,000.\nUnder the new penalty framework, the maximum financial penalty that can be imposed is now $300,000. For the two breaches of anti-money laundering obligations, a maximum of $200,000 in financial penalties can be imposed as each breach is now subjected to a maximum of $100,000. As for the two breaches of professional misconduct, an aggregate maximum financial penalty of $100,000 applies.\nThe amendments in this Bill will also enhance the composition framework for developers. Similar to estate agents and salespersons, developers are required to perform duties to counter money laundering and terrorism financing activities.\nCurrently, for less serious offences, non-compliant housing developers may be offered composition of up to $5,000 under the Housing Developers Control and Licensing Act (HDCLA). However, this is significantly lower than the maximum fine for money laundering and terrorism financing offences, at $100,000 per offence upon conviction.\nTo strengthen deterrence, clause 13 of the Bill amends the HDCLA to increase the maximum composition sum for housing developers from $5,000, to 50% of the maximum fine prescribed for the offence. This means that the maximum composition sums for some offences will be increased to $50,000.\nClause 16 of the Bill will also amend the Sale of Commercial Properties Act (SCPA) to allow offences by commercial and industrial developers to be compounded. Similar to the HDCLA, the maximum composition sum under the SCPA will be up to 50% of the maximum fine prescribed for the offence.\nWith these amendments, the approach for the maximum composition sums for money laundering and terrorism financing offences in the HDCLA and SCPA will be aligned with that of other sectors, such as precious stones and metal dealers.\nThe second set of amendments further align our regulatory regime with international standards set by the FATF.\nCurrently, estate agents and salespersons are only required to conduct due diligence measures on their own clients. Hence, in transactions where either the buyer or seller are not represented by estate agents and salespersons, property-related due diligence measures may not be conducted on the buyer or seller who is unrepresented.\nTo align with FATF standards, clause 6 of the Bill amends the Estate Agents Act to require estate agents and salespersons to conduct due diligence measures on such unrepresented counterparties of property transactions.\nIn recent years, FATF has also updated its standards to clearly set out the standards to identify, assess and mitigate risks associated with the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or proliferation financing in short.\nClauses 3 to 5, 12, 14, 15 and 17 of the Bill thus update the regulatory regime for estate agents, salespersons and developers to cover proliferation financing. This is similar to the relevant legislative frameworks for other sectors.\nThe amendments to the composition regime for developers in clauses 13 and 16 of the bill would also allow proliferation financing related offences to be compounded.\nIn the same vein, clauses 14 and 17 of the Bill amend the HDCLA and SCPA respectively to require developers to perform prescribed measures related to targeted financial sanctions for terrorism financing and proliferation financing, in addition to terrorism.\nToday, developers are required to assess whether a purchaser is designated as a terrorist or terrorist entity under relevant lists, or sanctioned by the United Nations. If so, developers are required to decline to enter into or terminate transactions with the potential purchaser, and report the matter to the Police.\nThe amendments will make clear that this also applies to purchasers who are on the designated or sanction lists due to terrorism financing and proliferation financing.\nThese measures for terrorism financing and proliferation financing are generally not new to estate agents, salespersons and developers. Such measures are already part of existing anti-money laundering requirements as the underlying terrorism financing and proliferation financing offences are also money laundering predicate offences. Efforts to combat terrorism financing and proliferation financing are also already part of the current measures performed by estate agents, salespersons and developers.\nWe now come to the third set of amendments which are clarifications to restrictions against persons convicted of money laundering, terrorism financing or proliferation financing offences.\nClause 2 of the Bill clarifies that persons who have been convicted of money laundering, terrorism financing, or proliferation financing offences, whether committed in Singapore or overseas, are not deemed fit and proper to hold an estate agent licence, or a salesperson registration under the Estate Agents Act, given the seriousness of such offences.\nSimilarly, clauses 12 and 15 of the Bill amend the HDCLA and SCPA respectively to clarify that money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing offences include offences under the law of any foreign country or territory. In this way, persons convicted of such offences regardless of where they are committed will be subjected to prohibitions against becoming a housing developer, becoming a substantial shareholder, or holding a responsible position in a developer or in substantial shareholders of a developer.\nCEA and the Urban Redevelopment Authority will disseminate more information on these upcoming amendments to the real estate sector.\nLet me conclude. This Bill aligns the real estate sector with international standards and is another step in strengthening our national strategy against money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing.\nAs criminals get more sophisticated over time, we will continue to remain vigilant and will not hesitate to tighten our regime further where necessary. As a society, we must also remain watchful and vigilant. Countering money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing in the real estate sector requires a concerted effort not just by the Government, but all stakeholders, such as businesses and individuals. This collective partnership is key to our continued efforts to act decisively to detect and deter such illicit activities, while ensuring that our financial and business ecosystem remains reputable and trusted, and continues to thrive.

    "section_title": "Social Residential Homes Bill ",
    "speaker": "Ms Ng Ling Ling",
    "speech": "Ms Ng Ling Ling\n: Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Social Residential Homes Bill. About 10 years ago, when I was the managing director of Community Chest in NCSS, I remember being invited by MSF colleagues then to visit a social residential home run by a charitable social service agency, looking after young children who had experienced severe abuses, including verbal, physical and sexual transgressions committed against them.\nI was carefully prepared by MSF for the visit, so as not to be shocked by behaviours, such as punching fists in the walls and others, before I was brought to visit the Home, as MSF colleagues wanted to discuss fundraising required to improve the care model of these children. While I was prepared for the worst, what greeted me at the Home – specifically in a room where some of the children were having tuition for their homework – were innocent young faces, not unlike that of my own son who was about the same age as these children then.\nAll I could conclude from that visit was that these children were born in the wrong families and wrong homes. What I was thankful for after the visit was an anonymous donor, whom I still do not know the identity of, who eventually donated half a million dollars to Community Chest through a former NCSS Board member and helped MSF pilot a better care model for these children.\nSir, social residential homes in Singapore house some of the most vulnerable Singaporeans of all ages, genders, race and religions. A strong legislative framework and rules to safeguard their living are thus extremely important and necessary. According to MSF, there are currently 61 such Homes run by various social service agencies. They range from Children's Homes, Homes for the Disabled, Aged Homes, Welfare Homes for Women and six Homes, such as Angsana, Banyan, Meranti Home in Pelangi Village in my Jalan Kayu constituency for the destitute, some of whom suffer from mental illnesses.\nThese Homes provide their residents with 24-hour by seven days residential accommodation and care as their own families or homes can no longer house them for a variety of reasons, often complex and not easy to resolve. This Social Residential Homes Bill which codifies the rules and changes that are important for the protection of how the Homes should be run for the welfare and well-being of these vulnerable residents, our fellow Singaporeans, is thus much needed. I strongly support the Bill, but will like to raise three areas for clarifications and suggestions.\nFirstly, on the Transition Support Package of $33 million one-off transition amount for training, safety and capability building, for example, to install CCTV systems for safety purposes, I wonder if MSF should not let this be just a one-time transition funding support, but instead, set up a more committed long-term capability fund, similar to the successful multi-year VWO Capability Fund (VCF) that MSF and NCSS are both experienced in designing, administering, evaluating and extending when the needs remain. I have seen VCF alleviate the standards and capabilities of many social service agencies delivering strategic and critical programmes over more than a decade of serving in the social service sector in my work at NCSS.\nThe social service agencies like Metta Welfare Association (Metta), Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS), Thye Hua Kwan, St Andrew's, Asian Women Welfare Association (AWWA), TOUCH, Pertapis and Trybe, just to name a few, running social residential homes will know well that these Homes are some of the hardest programmes that they need to deliver among their range of social service programmes that they provide. Helping them build standards, staff competencies and operational capabilities should not be a one-off effort but a long-term commitment.\nAnother help that MSF and NCSS should seriously consider is the facilitation for better use of public funds to help these social service agencies, such as in the bulk procurement for common equipment like CCTV systems, which can be very costly if each Home procures on its own.\nNext, on clarifying responsibilities of board members and volunteers. I note that the Bill provides for powers for MSF to issue Codes of Practices to codify standards of care, including governance, management of premises, resident management and incident management in the Homes. Breach of these Codes of Practices may result in regulatory actions for all social residential homes, irrespective of whether they are funded by MSF or not.\nThe Bill also provides for comprehensive framework to deter errant operators, where MSF may take regulatory actions and pursue criminal penalties against errant and/or failing social residential homes operators. MSF may also issue step-in orders to temporarily take over a failing operator's social residential home to ensure continuity of care. Further, MSF has introduced a new licensing regime with criminal penalties and regulatory actions revised to be proportionate to comparable offences under other Acts, such as the Healthcare Services Act.\nWhile I appreciate the good intentions to safeguard residents and the running such Homes through these changes, I would like to clarify at what level in MSF will the Codes of Practices, that can be issued from time to time with regulatory penalties for non-compliance, be approved. I understand that such codes may contain more details and requirements on operators than what the Bill has shown. Again, how does MSF strike a balance, considering the capabilities of the operators, and how will potential penalties for breaches be informed to the operators in each Code issued?\nI know of several friends in busy professions who are serving voluntarily on the Boards of the social service agencies running some of these social residential homes out of care and concerns for these vulnerable residents. They are unsure how the stiffer regulatory penalties will be imposed on the Board members, individually or collectively, in situations of breaches that are not of their doing. They asked what are the implications on the Board, the management and the staff, and how will MSF assess where the buck stops.\nLastly, on long-term capacity and capability building, I cannot empathise more with the challenges that the social service agencies running these homes face in manpower recruitment, retention and development. Many of them are highly reliant on foreign staff as it is difficult to get Singaporeans to work in many of the roles needed to run such Homes.\nOn the screening of foreign staff, I will like to ask how is MSF helping the agencies to ensure if the background checks of these staff are true and correct, especially if they come from countries that may have less developed systems of records on criminal or civil acts of delinquency, abuse or violence.\nI would like to take a moment to extend my deep appreciation to Singaporeans who volunteer to be on the Board of Visitors and Case Review Committees of these social residential homes, especially those who visit the residents on a monthly frequency. From my visits of some of these Homes over the years that I worked in NCSS, I have seen the most vulnerable of vulnerable Singaporeans living in them.\nMany of them, children and seniors included, may not be able to articulate their needs, given their disabilities or trauma that they have experienced unless a responsible adult visits them regularly and is observant of their behaviours and moods. The Board of Visitors forms an essential protective channel to give voices to some of these voiceless residents. I urge MSF to step up in expanding the group of the Board of Visitors for these Homes and encourage Singaporeans who have the compassion and commitment to step up and volunteer in these important roles.\nEach of the 61 Homes need good Singaporeans who are more privileged to be their volunteers, to serve on their Boards of Visitors and to be donors, like the anonymous donor that I mentioned, who had given to the Community Chest, in my opening paragraph.\nMy final appeal is to the Government, including the Ministry of Finance, to consider providing more budgets for MSF to gradually convert these social residential homes for the vulnerable to purpose-built Homes, like what the Ministry of Education (MOE) did for special education (SPED) schools over the past decades. MOE's efforts with the SPED schools have transformed what used to be disused and barely retrofitted SPED schools that I visited in the early 2000s, when I first entered the social service sector, to state-of-the-art well designed SPED Schools, like Pathlight School, that we see today in the Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency where I serve as a Member of Parliament.\nWhen the homes of our most vulnerable of the vulnerable Singaporeans, the least, the last and the lost are much like better homes that most Singaporeans experience through the decades as Singapore matures as a highly developed nation. I think then, we can truly be proud to bear the hallmark of a strong and caring nation who leaves no one behind. With that Sir, I support the Bill.\nMr Speaker\n:",

    "section_title": "Anti-Money Laundering and Other Matters (Estate Agents and Developers) Bill",
    "speaker": "Ms Indranee Rajah",
    "speech": "Ms Indranee Rajah\n: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Members for their comments and their support for this Bill. Let me address the issues raised.\nMr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Vikram Nair asked how this Bill improves the detection of real estate transactions linked to illicit funds and whether the additional obligations are necessary. Today, licensed estate agents, registered salespersons and developers are mandated to perform a robust set of customer due diligence measures on the clients they represent or purchasers. However, a buyer or seller who is unrepresented by an estate agent or salesperson may not be covered by such due diligence measures.\nThrough this Bill, we are requiring estate agents and salespersons to conduct due diligence measures on unrepresented counterparties, so that both parties in a property transaction are subject to robust checks. This will strengthen our regulatory and governance framework, and help to ensure more timely detection and prevention of illicit activities within the real estate sector.\nMr Don Wee, Mr Neil Parekh and Mr Yip Hon Weng asked how we will support the real estate sector in meeting these requirements, especially salespersons and smaller estate agents. Mr Neil Parekh also asked how estate agents, salespersons and developers can better monitor transactions that may be related to proliferation financing.\nI would like to clarify that the required due diligence measures are not new. All estate agents, salespersons and developers are familiar with how these checks should be done, as they are already required to conduct such measures on their own clients or purchasers. The amendments to include proliferation financing will make clear that estate agents, salespersons and developers would also have to screen the necessary parties for proliferation financing risks against relevant designated or sanction lists, which they have already been doing as part of countering terrorism financing.\nFor estate agents and salespersons specifically, the relevant content on the required due diligence measures is covered in the courses for new salespersons and continuing professional development courses for existing salespersons. To further support our estate agents and salespersons in meeting these obligations, we will be stepping up on training.\nFor the next continuing professional development cycle, anti-money laundering, countering terrorism financing and countering proliferation financing continuing professional development courses will be made mandatory. This is part of our earlier announced initiative to enhance the continuing professional development framework for the real estate agency industry, by increasing the annual continuing professional development training requirement to 16 hours from the end of this year.\nCEA has also set out clear guidelines on how customer due diligence measures should be done, including providing indicators of potential high-risk or suspicious transactions. CEA will update its resource webpage to put out more comprehensive information. This webpage will also be updated regularly to factor in new threats or vulnerabilities that arise over time.\nTo support smaller players, one of the industry associations in the real estate agency industry, namely the Singapore Estate Agents Association (SEAA), also provides subsidised access to commercial screening services, which its members can subscribe to.\nWe share Mr Don Wee's concern of a compliance burden on legitimate businesses. Mr Yip Hon Weng already raised the issue of how we will ensure that compliance costs are manageable. I would like to assure the Members that our requirements strike a balance between building a robust regime to uphold our reputation as an attractive and trusted financial centre, while minimising the regulatory burden imposed on the industry.\nFor example, the degree of checks required varies based on the assessed risk profile of the purchaser or client. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and CEA had also consulted the industry and took their feedback into account when developing the requirements. Our consultation included major estate agents, industry associations that represent many small and mid-sized estate agents and developers. Stakeholders understood the need for the changes and were supportive.\nMr Neil Parekh asked if the existing regime covers digital property platforms and cross-border transactions. Let me clarify, estate agents and salespersons who facilitate cross-border transactions by doing estate agency work in Singapore, wherein their clients purchase foreign properties will fall under the same compliance regime. Regarding digital property platforms, if an entity only publishes advertisements or disseminates information and does not perform work that constitutes estate agency work, it will not be subject to the requirements of the Estate Agents Act.\nConcerning developers, the Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Act and Sale of Commercial Properties Act cover all developers regulated by URA, including cross-border transactions and transactions on digital property platforms by these developers.\nOn Mr Don Wee's question on how the Government plans to monitor compliance with these new regulations. Let me assure the Member that CEA and URA already conduct regular inspections on estate agents, salespersons and developers today. During such inspections, CEA and URA check if the appropriate due diligence measures were performed. CEA and URA also conduct ad hoc inspections based on information from other law enforcement agencies, whistle-blowers or complaints received on possible infringements.\nWe share Mr Neil Parekh's view on the need to maintain Singapore's appeal to legitimate foreign investors while enforcing stricter checks. Having a strong system and measures in place to combat money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing provides certainty and makes our business environment more robust and attractive to foreign investors.\nIn this regard, CEA and URA adopt a risk-based approach when conducting inspections. For example, estate agents, salespersons and developers that are identified to be of higher risk are prioritised for inspections and subject to more regular inspections. Such risk factors include the customer profile and type of property being purchased or sold.\nMr Neil Parekh asked what the obligations and liabilities of estate agents and developers are, if a client or purchaser refuses to provide necessary due diligence documents. If an estate agent, salesperson or developer is unable to complete the required customer due diligence measures, the estate agent, salesperson or developer cannot proceed with the transaction and must also assess whether a Suspicious Transaction Report should be filed to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office.\nMr Don Wee asked about the penalties that will be imposed for non-compliance. Mr Neil Parekh asked if penalties will be calibrated based on the size of the business or intent. The key changes to the penalty framework are as per what I had set out in my opening speech. I would like to clarify that all estate agents, salespersons and developers are required to comply with the requirements in this Bill and are subject to the same maximum penalties in their respective categories, regardless of size. Contraventions of anti-money laundering obligations are assessed based on the facts and circumstances of each case. It would not be appropriate to calibrate penalties based on company size.\nOn Mr Don Wee's and Mr Neil Parekh's clarifications on this Bill’s implementation timeline, we will bring it into force in June 2025. CEA and URA will share the revised guidelines and implementation details in advance of that.\nMr Yip Hon Weng asked how we would measure the effectiveness of the proposals in this Bill. Potential indications will include the number of severe cases that have been averted due to the existence of this latest set of requirements.\nMembers Mr Don Wee and Mr Yip Hon Weng asked what efforts will be made to educate the general public about the changes in this Bill and to foster a culture of vigilance against money laundering. The ongoing efforts by URA, CEA and law enforcement agencies will continue. These include educating homebuyers on the need to provide information to facilitate customer due diligence measures, and outreach efforts to the wider society through digital posters on money laundering risks.\nNext, Mr Don Wee asked how Government agencies collaborate to ensure a cohesive and effective approach to countering money laundering. Mr Yip Hon Weng also asked what proactive measures are being implemented to identify deceitful activities and prevent them before they occur.\nToday, we already have an inter-agency taskforce to deal with money laundering cases. We have reinforced this taskforce by expanding its membership to include all agencies involved in combatting money laundering, including CEA and URA. This will strengthen inter-agency coordination for supervisory and enforcement action. We are also developing a new interface to facilitate data-sharing across Government agencies so that we will have a more comprehensive picture of potential money laundering risks.\nMr Yip Hon Weng asked whether CEA is equipped to deal with evolving money laundering threats. The close partnership between Government agencies ensures that agencies, like CEA and URA, can tap on the various inter-agency platforms to share intelligence, detect suspicious activities and coordinate enforcement.\nI turn, now, to the points raised by Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and let me just check my records and my notes of what he said. If I can summarise, essentially, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim suggested that the changes or the amendments in this Bill do not appear to go very far. But at the same time, he, in a sense, actually answered his own question because he said he assumed that the underlying reason for the seemingly limited state of affairs is that we have an already robust regime. And that is exactly right.\nSo, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim's starting point is correct. We have a very robust regime and that is the reason why we were able to crack that $3 billion money laundering case. But that said, it is clearly not perfect, and we felt, after that, that it was necessary to see what the gaps were and how we could further strengthen an already strong regime.\nSo, there were two points that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim raised. He asked about the inclusion of proliferation financing, suggesting that this appeared to be an add-on that did not take things very far. And then, the enhancement of penalties which also did not appear to be big moves.\nThe answer to that is, actually, I think, maybe Assoc Prof Lim may have missed the bigger picture. The bigger picture being this, first, on proliferation financing. As I mentioned in my opening speech, I said, \"This Bill seeks to strengthen current penalty frameworks and to further align our regulatory regime with FATF standards and then to make miscellaneous amendments to clarify certain things.\"\nSo, that second point, \"aligning our regulatory regime with FATF standards\". The old FATF standards dealt with money laundering and countering terrorism. But the updated standards include proliferation financing. So, the reason for these amendments is because FATF updated its recommendations to member countries to include mitigation of proliferation financing risks and we are, therefore, updating our legislation to align with the FATF standards. So, that takes care of the proliferation financing part.\nBut the much bigger picture is this, and Assoc Prof Lim actually did refer to it in the course of his speech, which was, he said, and this is again exactly correct, that the amendments in this Bill are actually pursuant to the recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Anti-Money Laundering, which I co-chaired with various other Ministers of State.\nAnd under that report, which is available on the MAS website, there was a whole slew of measures. First, it started out by explaining our already strong system. Then, it talked about the recommendations that we were making and there were three key broad categories falling under the headings of \"Prevent\", \"Detect\" and \"Enforce\".\nAnd under prevention and detection, there was a wide range of measures in the report. Under enforcement, it was recommended that we do a few things, one of which was to strengthen sense-making and information-sharing, and also to enhance legislative levers for law enforcement agencies and then also to continuously review penalty frameworks to ensure they remain proportionate and dissuasive.\nSo, in other words, the Inter-Ministerial Committee report contain the whole slew of things under those three broad categories; and under the third one, enforcement, there were various things, one of which was to really review the penalty framework. And this is what this Act does. So, this Act implements one small section of what was a very large body of work with extensive recommendations to strengthen our regime. So, I hope that that addresses the question that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim raised.\nSo, in conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank hon Members who have spoken and supported this Bill. This Bill is part of our continuing efforts to bolster our ability to detect and deter money laundering, terrorism financing and proliferation financing within the real estate sector. This ensures that our financial and business ecosystem remains reputable and trusted, and continues to thrive.\n5.24 pm\nMr Deputy Speaker\n:",

    "speech": "Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant\n: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Estate agencies and property developers may need to hire more compliance professionals, invest in new technology and restructure internal processes to meet reporting obligations.\nI now have six clarifications for the Minister.\nOne, while the Bill addresses proliferation financing, it would be useful to clarify how this concept specifically applies to estate agents and property developers. For instance, how will transactions involving foreign buyers be monitored for potential links to such financing and what specific indicators or red flags should agents look out for?\nTwo, will digital property platforms involved in cross-border transactions fall under the same compliance regime. It would be helpful to understand how enforcement will be operationalised in these more complex situations, providing stakeholders with reassurance and confidence in the regulatory process.\nThree, this Bill introduces stricter obligations, but stakeholders may need more clarity on the level of verification required, especially in complex commercial property transactions. It would be helpful to specify the legal obligations and liabilities when a client refuses to provide due diligence documentation.\nFour, given the additional compliance requirements, smaller firms may face challenges in adapting to this new setup. It would be helpful to know if there are any scaled compliance measures for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) or support initiatives such as training, grants, or digital tools to help them meet these obligations without compromising their competitiveness. Clarity on whether penalties will be calibrated based on business size or intent would ensure that SMEs are not disproportionately impacted by unintentional lapses.\nFive, this Bill aims to align with FATF's recommendations, but estate agents and developers may need more guidance on handling transactions involving foreign jurisdictions that do not have equivalent AML/CFT standards. It would be important to consider how stricter checks might affect legitimate foreign investment. What strategies will be employed to ensure that the enhanced compliance measures do not deter investment flows, thereby maintaining Singapore’s appeal as a financial hub?\nLastly, while the Bill outlines the need for compliance, businesses would benefit from a more structured transitional support. Beyond the implementation window, what forms of assistance – such as grants, digital compliance tools or subsidised training\n–\nare planned to help businesses operationalise these requirements efficiently? Such support will be crucial, especially for SMEs navigating the new regulatory landscape.\nMr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill marks a pivotal step in protecting Singapore’s financial system and real estate sector from abuse. Strengthening due diligence, tightening enforcement, and embracing global standards affirms our position as a responsible, forward-looking financial hub.\nBut as we raise the bar, we must also bring our businesses\n–\nespecially the smaller ones\n–\nalong with us. Implementation must be firm but fair. The regulatory net must be tight, but not so tangled that it stifles legitimate activity or innovation. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications, this Bill has my full support.\nMr Deputy Speaker\n:",

I would like to assure them and the House that the transfer process has been thoroughly planned and will be executed in a seamless manner to ensure that the functions continue to be delivered efficiently.\nFirst, such enforcement functions are not new to CCCS. As I had shared earlier, during the start of the reading, CCCS has developed expertise as well as experience as a regulatory authority on unfair trading practices since 2018. Taking over these additional consumer protection functions on product safety and legal metrology is complementary and, in fact, synergistic to its existing functions.\nSecond, Enterprise Singapore's CPSO and WMO – both their officers as well as the budgets – will be wholly transferred from Enterprise Singapore to CCCS. All public officers in CPSO and WMO will move over accordingly to ensure continuity and enhance cross-sharing of expertise and there will be no impact to other officers in either Enterprise Singapore or CCCS.\nAs there will be no change to the capabilities and processes of CPSO and WMO, industry stakeholders as well as the members of the public can continue to access the services and the resources that are provided by CPSO as well as WMO during the transfer. More details on the new contact touchpoints following the transfer will certainly be provided to involve stakeholders soon.\nThese steps will set CCCS' ability to administer the product safety and legal metrology regimes from the get-go following the transfer.\nI will now address the two Members' questions on our broader approach towards consumer protection.\nAs shared in my speech at the Ministry of Trade and Industry's Committee of Supply debate, in fact, just last month, the Government is certainly very mindful that for markets to function properly, consumers' trust in merchants and markets must be upheld. To do so, we must ensure that the regulatory system is fair and transparent to protect consumers while ensuring that the businesses can operate efficiently and are on the same level playing field. So, I fully agree with Mr Yip Hon Weng on the importance of maintaining this balance and I also agree with Mr Melvin Yong on the need to ensure that our regulations remain robust and effective. Let me elaborate.\nFirst, we believe that regulations should be clear, transparent and fit-for-purpose without creating excessive burden. We also take a practical approach to consumer protection regulations. For example, our product safety regime adopts a risk-based approach where stricter regulations, including registration and testing, apply only to a defined list of higher-risk household appliances, such as refrigerators and cooking appliances.\nFor most of general consumer goods, for example, sports equipment and furniture, we then take a more self-regulatory approach, requiring the products to adhere to applicable international as well as local safety standards.\nWe also provide guidelines and resources to help businesses better understand and comply with our regulations. For example, CPSO and WMO send compliance advisories to our businesses, including SMEs, through the trade associations and also e-commerce platforms. Because when everyone understands the rules, it then creates a fairer marketplace where businesses can focus on what they do best and provide safe and high-quality products for our consumers.\nConsumer education is also critical in ensuring consumers are aware of product characteristics and are able to make informed decisions when purchasing and also using the products. For example, CPSO communicates educational information and safety tips via its website to educate and also alert the consumers of products that are at higher risk of safety breaches.\nSecond, we proactively consult and also engage industry stakeholders, including SMEs, as well as other partners, when reviewing our regulations, to ensure that we incorporate the perspectives of the private sector and consider the latest developments. For instance, CPSO has set up an Advisory Committee comprising industry experts, academics and Government representatives to provide objective and independent advice on whether certain household appliances should be added to or should be removed from the list of controlled goods.\nAs both Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Yip Hon Weng have pointed out, consumer markets are constantly evolving and becoming more diverse, from digital goods and online marketplaces to groceries and daily essentials. The Government is certainly cognisant of these developments and is certainly working with the industry to closely monitoring all the developments. We have already started our work to actively consult the industries as part of a more fundamental review of our consumer protection regime.\nJust last month, Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Gan Kim Yong, announced that the Government has convened a Consumer Protection Review Panel to review key consumer concerns in Singapore, such as prepayment losses, online commerce and also to assess the need to strengthen our enforcement powers and ability to deal with emerging trends.\nThe Panel is co-chaired by Mr Melvin Yong and retired judicial commissioner Ms Foo Tuat Yien. The Panel will develop recommendations to drive consumer empowerment, raise industry standards and strengthen regulatory levers, where appropriate. The Panel held its kick-off meeting last week and we certainly look forward to receiving and studying the Panel's recommendations in time to come.\nSir, to conclude, our goal is to create a system that works for consumers, that works for businesses and that works for the economy. Where errant trading practices present real risks to consumers and honest businesses, we must make sure that appropriate safeguards and enforcement actions are in place without burdening the businesses and consumers.\nWhere regulations can be streamlined and requirements made efficient, we will certainly pursue these solutions. These key elements of balance, trust and partnership underpin the Government's approach to consumer protection and we will certainly continue to refine and strengthen our approach.\nI would like to thank both Members once again for their support of this Bill. Mr Speaker, I seek to move.\n5.58 pm\nMr Speaker\n:",

    "speaker": "Mr Eric Chua",
    "speech": "(Mr Eric Chua) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development)\n: Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Development, I move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\nMany Singaporeans have opportunities to flourish and thrive at every life stage. This is part of our social compact, where Singaporeans have access to opportunities and are valued, regardless of their backgrounds or circumstances.\nHowever, some amongst us may not have sufficient means to provide for themselves and may need additional assistance.\nSocial residential homes provide alternative care arrangements for the most vulnerable amongst us. Today, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) oversees more than 60 social residential homes that provide 24/7 residential care to almost 4,000 residents. These include seniors, vulnerable adults, children and young persons in need of care and protection, persons with disabilities and destitute persons.\nMembers in this House may be familiar with some social residential homes.\nChen Su Lan Methodist Home, for example, operates a Children’s Home and a Children Disability Home within the same compound. This home provides residential care to children in need of care and protection, including some with developmental needs.\nThye Hua Kwan is another example. They operate seven social residential homes that provide residential care to children and adults with disabilities, and destitute persons.\nSocial residential homes have existed in Singapore, long before we gained Independence. In the past 60 years, we have journeyed with the sector to provide good quality care to residents through funding, licensing and training.\nThe Government first started funding Children’s Homes in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, funding was extended to Homes caring for seniors and persons with disabilities.\nTo improve the quality of care in Homes, we further introduced a licensing regime for Sheltered Homes under the Homes for the Aged Act in 1988, as well as Homes for Children and Young Persons, which include Children’s Homes and Children Disability Homes, under the amendments to the Children and Young Persons Act in 2011.\nWe also recognised the need to equip their staff with specialised skillsets to care for persons in residential care. In 2011, MSF and the Social Service Institute developed certificate programmes in residential care. To date, about 1,500 professionals have been trained.\nMore recently, in 2024, MSF and SG Enable introduced a skills and competency framework to guide Disability Sector Professionals, such as care staff and social workers, in effectively supporting and providing training for persons with disabilities.\nOver the years, care models have evolved to better meet residents’ needs. Today, we adopt a tiered approach for the Children’s Homes, where more intensive care is provided to children with higher care needs.\nThe Social Residential Homes Bill is a proactive step taken by MSF to codify the good progress that has been made in raising the quality of care provided by the sector over the years.\nThe first question people ask tends to be “Why now?”. To be clear, we are not coming from a position of deficit. Incidents of a serious nature are rare and our Homes are upholding good standards. The introduction of the Bill is to prepare for the future.\nLooking ahead, our population is rapidly ageing and family sizes are shrinking. The Government continues to strengthen efforts to help our seniors age in place, and enable persons with disabilities to live with dignity and participate in the community. Nonetheless, we recognise that there will always be some who are more vulnerable, who will need residential care. It is therefore important that we continually strive for higher quality care in social residential homes.\nThis Bill will uplift the quality of care across the social residential home sector and strengthen safeguards for the safety and well-being of residents.\nUnder this Bill, we will consolidate the existing licensing regimes for Sheltered Homes, and Homes for Children and Young Persons, which comprises Children’s Homes and Children Disability Homes. In addition, unlicensed Homes, which are mostly governed today through funding agreements, will now be brought under the ambit of this Bill.\nIn total, 61 Homes with about 4,000 residents will come under this Bill – a significant increase from the 35 Homes, with approximately 1,100 residents, that are currently licensed.\nTo arrive at this Bill, we conducted many engagements with the different stakeholders, such as Home operators, board members and members of the public. I would like to express my appreciation to all operators and board members of the 61 Homes who have worked closely with us to develop this Bill. Your views, ideas and feedback have helped us to better understand the needs in our social residential home landscape. Thank you for your active participation in co-creating solutions with us and for your tireless work over the years to care for our residents.\nBefore I go into the key provisions, allow me to first clarify the three main groups of people mentioned in the Bill.\nFirst, the licensee. This refers to entities or individuals who are responsible and accountable for the overall compliance with requirements in the Bill.\nSecond, the key appointment holders. This refers to individuals who are responsible for strategic leadership and overall management of the Home.\nThird, the person-in-charge. This refers to the head of the Home who oversees day-to-day management of Home operations.\nI will now turn to the key provisions of the Bill, which are grouped into three key areas: first, setting clear standards for Homes to deliver quality care; second, establishing stronger safeguards for residents’ safety and well-being; and third, introducing a comprehensive enforcement framework as a deterrence against errant operators.\nThe first key area is setting clear standards for Homes to deliver quality care.\nMSF will issue Codes of Practice, which comprises regulatory requirements pertaining to key areas, such as: one, governance of the Home; two, management of premises; three, resident management; and four, incident management.\nToday, some Homes already comply with standards as set out in our service model requirements, in order to receive funding. Moving forward, these Codes of Practice will provide greater clarity to both operators and residents on the standards of care that are expected from operators. These Codes of Practice will be issued after close consultation with operators, with guidance and support from MSF to ensure that Homes can meet the specified requirements.\nThe second key area focuses on stronger safeguards for residents’ safety and well-being. Home residents require 24/7 care and are heavily reliant on others to fulfil daily living needs, such as dressing and toileting. Other residents are children. These are highly vulnerable persons. It is therefore necessary to ensure that residents not only receive quality care and support, but are also safeguarded from harm in these Homes.\nOur Home operators share this common commitment with us. Mr Michael Gan, chief executive officer of the Bishan Home for the Intellectually Disabled, commended the Bill for building on the good foundations our sector has already established. He described these clear parameters as a step towards greater accountability to help us achieve our common goal of residents’ safety and well-being.\nMs Nura Binte Hassan, the head of Bukit Batok Home for the Aged, has been part of this sector for more than 10 years, and has seen the progress that we have made over this time. She, too, welcomes the Bill as a timely move that provides clarity to the sector and reaffirms our collective commitment towards the welfare and overall well-being of residents.\nWe will put in place measures to ensure residents are not placed at risk of harm in the Home. Firstly, it will be mandatory for all licensees, key appointment holders, persons-in-charge, staff and other individuals who perform prescribed duties, such as vendors who provide direct care to residents, to undergo a suitability assessment.\nThis requirement is not new to most of the Home operators. Today, suitability assessments already apply to staff in our funded Homes, as well as licensees and staff in our licensed Homes.\nUnder the Bill, we will extend this practice to all other Homes. We want to be sure that only individuals with good standing are allowed to be deployed in the Homes. This would ensure continuity of Home operations and continuity of care for residents within.\nIn so doing, we can also provide assurance to residents, their family members as well as operators that individuals deployed in these Homes can be trusted to provide quality care to residents.\nSecond, the use of reasonable force or mechanical restraints is prohibited unless under specified circumstances.\nToday, some residents may exhibit aggressive or challenging behaviours due to underlying root causes, such as psychiatric conditions. These behaviours may put them at risk of harming themselves or others.\nUnder strictly defined circumstances, the use of reasonable force and/or mechanical restraints by properly trained staff could help to ensure that residents do not further harm themselves, or other persons in the Home, like fellow residents or staff.\nWe take a firm stance against any unauthorised or excessive use of force or mechanical restraints. Therefore, MSF will set out the parameters within which the use of force or mechanical restraints would be permitted under the Bill, to deter against any potential forms of abuse.\nUnder the Bill, MSF will appoint a Board of Visitors to conduct independent checks on social residential homes. The Board of Visitors comprises professionals who complement MSF’s licensing inspections to ensure that residents reside in safe and sanitary premises.\nThe Board of Visitors visits Homes regularly to check on its premises, speak to residents and provide third-party feedback to MSF on the Home’s living conditions and standards of care. They will also share best practices with the Homes they visit.\nToday, some Homes, such as Welfare Homes and Children’s Homes, are already visited regularly by a Board of Visitors and have benefited from such visits. For Marymount Centre, a Children’s Home, these visits have provided a fresh perspective on the Home’s operations and enabled them to identify areas for improvement. For Bukit Batok Home for the Aged, their staff have come to regard such visits as invaluable opportunities for learning of best practices from other Homes. We will therefore extend this good practice to other Homes through this Bill.\nThe third key area focuses on a comprehensive enforcement framework to deter against errant operators.\nTo be clear, our Homes have been providing good care to residents. We have worked well with operators to continuously review the care provided and where needed, made operational adjustments to uphold quality care. Nonetheless, we do not take for granted that egregious incidents will never happen in our Homes. Our residents are highly vulnerable and we need effective levers to prevent and manage incidents, should they occur. Therefore, under this Bill, we have introduced a comprehensive enforcement framework as a deterrent against errant operators.\nUnder the Bill, MSF may take a range of regulatory action against errant operators. As part of a graduated approach to enforcement, we have introduced a range of tools that will allow us to take regulatory actions that correspond to the degree of harm caused.\nRegulatory actions under the existing licensing regimes in the Homes for the Aged Act and Children and Young Persons Act are limited. Today, we can revoke a licence if a regulatory breach has occurred. However, some regulatory breaches could be minor and need not warrant a revocation of licence. Instead, it may be more appropriate to shorten the Home’s licence tenure and allow the Home a chance to rectify the breach. We are not able to do so today.\nIt is therefore timely for MSF to update our suite of regulatory actions. Under the Social Residential Homes Bill, in addition to the revocation of licence, we can also modify, shorten, or suspend licences, and these would be more appropriate for less severe breaches. MSF may also pursue criminal penalties for more serious contraventions.\nToday, residents in our Homes are already protected under other legislation, such as the Children and Young Persons Act, and the Penal Code. MSF also closely manages our funded homes through funding agreements, to make sure residents are safe and well.\nUnder the Social Residential Homes Bill, we have taken the opportunity to review the penalty quanta to be imposed for egregious offences. For example, under MSF’s Homes for the Aged Act, operating a Sheltered Home without a licence may warrant a fine of no more than $5,000, or imprisonment for no more than two years, or both. This is the maximum penalty that can be imposed.\nUnder this Bill, the offence of operating a Home without a licence may now warrant a fine of no more than $100,000, with no change to the maximum jail term. This signals the importance of the safety and well-being of residents, who are vulnerable.\nWe recognise that Homes have concerns about the penalties under this Bill. Many operators in this space are driven by a sense of compassion and a deep sense of social responsibility, and many of their Board members are themselves volunteers.\nFirst and foremost, MSF will take a developmental and supportive stance. Our goal is not to be punitive at the outset, but to support Homes in meeting standards that safeguard the well-being of their residents.\nWe intend to work closely with Homes to uplift the sector. To operators of live-in care facilities who are uncertain about their licensing obligations, we encourage you to reach out to MSF for support, as we transition to this new framework.\nFurther, to assuage Homes’ concerns, we will set out the responsibilities of each stakeholder in our Regulations and Codes of Practice. Homes will be consulted in this exercise conducted later this year.\nMSF will also be able to issue step-in orders to temporarily take over a failing operator’s Home for continuity of care for residents.\nAs far as possible, MSF will work closely with operators to promptly resolve operational issues. However, we recognise that some operators may not be able do so even with other measures, such as capability building and regulatory action, in place. We must therefore have a fallback plan to minimise disruption and ensure the safety, welfare or well-being of the residents in the Home. This is when step-in powers will be activated.\nThis may take the form of appointing a third party to advise the licensee on the Home’s operations or a temporary transfer of residents to another Home. Should there be a need, MSF may also appoint another operator to temporarily take over operations to ensure continuity of care for residents.\nMSF will adopt a risk-based regulatory approach. As a start, we will license social residential homes that provide long-term and 24/7 residential care. Homes that fall under the scope of the Social Residential Homes Bill are Adult Disability Homes, which includes Adult Disability Hostels, Homes for Children and Young Persons which comprises Children’s Homes and Children Disability Homes, Sheltered Homes and Welfare Homes. Operators whose homes fall under this scope have been consulted and notified of our intent to license the respective Homes. For other operators who are unsure if you fall under the scope of the Bill, please step forward to check with us in MSF.\nShould the needs of clients in other Home types evolve, we will review whether to extend the licensing regime to these Homes as well. Consultations with the relevant stakeholders will be carried out as part of these reviews.\nTo support operators in transitioning to a new licensing regime, MSF and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) have set aside a $33 million Transition Support Package for all social residential homes that will be licensed under this Bill. This is on top of ongoing adjustments to our programme funding for social residential homes. With this funding, Homes will be able to invest in:\nTraining for staff in critical areas such as management of violent behaviours by residents. This will help to keep both residents and staff in our Homes safe.\nUpdating or installing CCTV systems, to enable Homes to better monitor the safety of residents. This will also function as a deterrent against any form of abuse against residents or staff.\nChange management efforts, such as planning and reviewing internal work processes, to adhere to the regulatory requirements under this Bill.\nThe Transition Support Package has been well-received by Home operators. The components of this package were designed based on operators’ feedback and suggestions on support that would help them transition successfully to the new licensing regime.\nTo our Home operators, we are committed to supporting you in this journey. Besides the Transition Support Package, MSF will also offer developmental consultations to social residential homes. These developmental consultations form a key part of our pre-implementation preparation. They will provide operators with greater clarity on key areas of improvement that they will need to focus on as they prepare to onboard the new licensing regime. It will also enable MSF to provide operators with more targeted support and guidance under this Bill.\nI have shared extensively about the enhanced safeguards for residents’ safety and well-being that we will introduce under this Bill. I will now touch on what we are doing for the Homes’ staff.\nThe safety and well-being of staff are equally important to us. MSF adopts a zero-tolerance policy towards abuse or harassment of staff. Staff in these Homes are “public service workers” under the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 and as such, will receive enhanced protection under that Act. Any person who abuses staff in the Homes can also be taken to task under the Penal Code 1871.\nBeyond the Bill, MSF and NCSS will continue to work closely with the sector to develop a strong and resilient social service workforce.\nI want to convey my heartfelt appreciation to all staff working in our Homes. To all the dedicated staff, we want to express our deepest gratitude because we know your work is not easy. The challenges you face require strength, passion and most of all, compassion. The residents rely on you and your care, and I want to assure you that your contributions are appreciated every single day, even though the residents may not say it. We value your hard work and contributions and will continue to invest in your growth and well-being.\nWe regularly review the NCSS Skills and Salary Guidelines and work with Social Service Agencies to ensure that salaries in the sector are competitive with comparable roles in competing markets.\nYour professional development matters to us. We have charted progression pathways through the Skills Framework for Social Service and will continue to provide support for staff to be equipped with the necessary competencies to upskill themselves and effectively deliver care.\nWe recognise that work in the social services can be demanding, which is why we are providing resources to both employers and employees. For instance, NCSS works closely with social service agencies to develop stronger organisational capabilities and create a supportive workplace environment. While we work to equip and empower leaders in social service agencies to create a supportive work environment, social service employees can also access well-being support resources provided by NCSS.\nSir, let me conclude. This Bill reflects the Government’s commitment to uplift and strengthen support for the most vulnerable amongst us, in partnership with our community partners.\nThe Bill builds upon past efforts by the Government and the social residential home operators to provide good quality care for these residents. We will continue to work closely with Homes to achieve our collective vision to care for the vulnerable in our society, to realise our ambition for a caring Singapore where no one is left behind.\n[(proc text) Question proposed.

    "speech": "Mr K Shanmugam\n: As at 1 April 2025, there are over 153,000 Will records deposited with the Singapore Academy of Law's Wills Registry. Registration with the Wills Registry is voluntary. Doing so makes it easier to locate the Will when needed. But the validity of a testator's Will does not depend on whether one has registered his or her Will with the Registry.\nThe Government has embarked on a national legacy planning campaign, to encourage legacy planning, as it would allow Singaporeans to plan ahead on how they would like to be cared for or their assets to be distributed, in the event that they lose mental capacity or pass on, thus reducing uncertainty and disputes over their estate.\nThis national campaign promotes, among many things, MyLegacy@LifeSG (mylegacy.life.gov.sg), a one-stop Government portal that provides citizens with information and services on legacy planning.

The Total WSH Programme for companies also provides free ergonomics-related training to help workers better understand and prevent these disorders.\nPreventing work-related musculoskeletal disorders requires collective ownership by employers and workers. Employers need to design proper work processes and provide mechanical aids and equipment; while workers need to exercise ownership in practising good ergonomics, such as adopting proper posture and correct lifting techniques.

    "section_title": "Understanding and Responding to Intimate Partner Violence in Singapore",
    "speaker": "Ms Sun Xueling",
    "speech": "(Ms Sun Xueling)\n: Mr Speaker, Sir, my condolences to Assoc Prof Razwana on the death of her good friend and I thank her for making this important speech in Parliament.\nIn 2024, MSF released our Domestic Violence Trends Report. This is an inaugural report. Singapore does not tolerate violence against persons. No one should experience violence, especially at the hands of a person whom they should love and trust.\nOur work to prevent and eradicate domestic violence is a continuous, intensive piece of work that we engage in together with our community and social service partners. Every day, we are thinking about how to better protect survivors and to hold perpetrators to account.\nKindly allow me to share the framework we have in place in Singapore to tackle domestic violence. First and foremost, our legislative system. We have five key pieces of legislation in place to address domestic violence.\nFirst, for protection of family members, the Women's Charter was amended in 2023 to empower survivors, regardless of gender, to better protect themselves and their children; strengthen the Government's ability to intervene in family violence cases; and empower the Courts to make additional rehabilitative orders.\nRehabilitative orders can be issued with a Personal Protection Order. This includes the counselling order, which can be mandated by the Courts and the counselling conducted by the social service agencies. This reflects the Ministry's approach to domestic violence, which emphasises the repairing of harm and the mending of relationships, and is aligned with the spirit of Restorative Justice.\nSecond, the Penal Code was amended in 2019 to double the maximum penalties for certain offences when committed against vulnerable victims, including those in intimate or close relationships with the perpetrator. In line with the enhanced punishments under the Penal Code for offences against vulnerable persons and intimate partners, the penalties for offences under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) against vulnerable persons and intimate partners was doubled in 2019.\nThird, the POHA Protection Orders regime was strengthened by establishing a dedicated Protection from Harassment Court.\nFourth, for those who cannot protect themselves from abuse because of a mental or physical infirmity, disability or incapacity, we have the Vulnerable Adults Act introduced in 2018.\nFifth, underwriting all this is the Criminal Procedure Code, which is the main piece of legislation that provides the powers and procedures for enforcing our criminal laws to hold perpetrators to account.\nComplementing the legal framework, we have upstream and downstream efforts to tackle domestic violence. I appreciate the Member's call for the community to be engaged. And indeed, preventing and addressing violence is a whole of society effort.\nExamples of MSF's upstream efforts include: partnering Institutes of Higher Learning to drive awareness on respectful relationships amongst youths; partnering ethnic organisations and community agencies on domestic violence topics to foster community awareness; and running domestic violence awareness training workshops to equip the community with the knowledge to spot and safely intervene when they see potential cases of domestic violence in the community. We have also invested in public education to increase awareness of abuse through our \"Break The Silence\" campaign.\nWe note the Member's feedback that home-based care for the elderly may increase the risk of social isolation or abuse due to caregiver stress, and her suggestion for home visitation services. Our Silver Generation Office currently reaches out to those aged 60 and above to identify needs and refer them to relevant support or services, such as Active Ageing Centres for befriending and buddying service.\nWhere violence has taken place, 24-hour services are available to facilitate reporting and for survivors to receive immediate help: the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline was enhanced in 2022 to include online reporting. The Domestic Violence Emergency Response Team (DVERT) was introduced in 2023, where social service professionals respond jointly with the Police in high-risk cases with immediate safety concerns.\nThe Member suggested on-site issuance of Personal Protection Orders against perpetrators. The Women's Charter amendments, which were operationalised in January 2025, allow the issuance of Emergency Orders on site by DVERT officers, in high-risk cases to better protect the survivors. The Emergency Order may also include a Domestic Exclusion Order, a Stay Away Order or a No Contact Order imposed on the perpetrator. A breach of any of these orders is an arrestable offence.\nOur social service agencies are our key partners in the efforts to tackle domestic violence, and I would like to commend our Family Service Centres, Protection Specialist Centres and the Integrated Service for Individual and Family Protection Specialist Centre, for partnering us on this journey.\nThe Member highlighted the importance of other elements of support, such as immediate financial support and expediting purchase or rental of HDB property for survivors. I understand where she is coming from. Mr Speaker, Assoc Prof Razwana, I have worked with several of these survivors before. Their immediate need is to be referred to crisis shelters, who will work with survivors to address their safety concerns and to assist them in subsequently securing stable housing arrangements.\nI have also written letters to the Ministry of National Development before, to facilitate rental housing for these survivors, so I know that it can be done. And those who require urgent financial assistance may also tap on Interim Assistance, which provides immediate one-off financial assistance to individuals and families requiring urgent and temporary financial relief. Those who need longer term support for their basic needs can also be referred to the Social Service Offices for ComCare assistance.\nThese efforts aim to empower survivors to stay safe and work towards financial independence, in line with what the Member has suggested. There is also support for perpetrators who cannot remain in their homes due to statutory orders. If they are unable to find alternate accommodation, they can seek assistance from transitional shelters.\nWhat is important also is our capabilities to better support domestic violence survivors. And over the years, the training of social workers to deliver support and services to the survivors has been enhanced. Social workers, counsellors and psychologists now undergo more specialised training to strengthen their ability to deliver timely and effective psychosocial support and trauma interventions, including being sensitive to the diverse needs of survivors of domestic violence. I thank the Member for her suggestions to use technology to enhance the training for professionals and the support provided to survivors. We will review these suggestions.\nThe Member has also highlighted the importance of a nationwide response and framework to end domestic violence. As she has shared, this is in the form of the Taskforce on Family Violence, which I co-chaired with Minister of State for Home Affairs Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim. And within the MSF, we also have specialised Protective Service units, which are part of a larger Rehabilitation and Protection Group in the MSF.\nAs for the suggestions on workplace initiatives and for better healthcare integration and support, this is something we will explore with the tripartite partners. The employers' greatest contribution is to support survivors to rebuild their lives, by giving them the opportunity of a job and to thrive in the workplace. Beyond that, I am a bit mindful that we should not make employers do things which the Government or the community is better equipped to do.\nTo conclude, I would like to reiterate that the Government takes a strong stance against violence. But we cannot do this alone because of the hidden nature of domestic violence. Addressing domestic violence requires a whole-of-society approach, and I thank the Member for her speech, which not only highlights this important issue, but also emphasises how this is a shared responsibility. Domestic violence is not a private matter. Everyone has a part to play in building a society where families are strong and everyone feels safe.\n[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

    "speaker": "Mr Ong Ye Kung",
    "speech": "Mr Ong Ye Kung\n: The Ministry of Health (MOH) outlined its key strategies to manage healthcare cost during the recent Committee of Supply (COS) debate. These are widely regarded as international best practices.\nTo manage growth in cost of delivery, we implemented Health Technology Assessments to ensure that we fund and encourage the use of health technologies that are clinically- and cost-effective. With these efforts, we observed that drug spending growth in the public healthcare system has slowed from around 10% before financial year (FY) 2021 to 5% in FY2023.\nWe have also implemented a value-driven care programme throughout our public healthcare clusters, tracking and benchmarking quality and cost outcomes across common conditions and identifying areas for improvement. These ensure that what we spend on healthcare is commensurate with good health outcomes for Singaporeans.\nDemand for healthcare will grow with an ageing population. Through Healthier SG and Age Well SG, we are investing in population health to keep Singaporeans healthier for longer. We are transforming care to anchor care in communities as far as possible, instead of over-relying on acute hospitals.\nWe developed and publish fee benchmarks for close to 2,200 common procedures and conditions to guide fee setting in the private healthcare sector. We also publish hospital bill size information across all hospitals and ward types to enable patients to make comparisons. Through a Claims Management Office that we set up in 2022, we have stepped-up monitoring and enforcement against inappropriate MediShield Life claims that may drive up costs and healthcare insurance premiums.\nFinally, an important factor to manage costs is to ensure that we maintain financial discipline in how we pay for healthcare. We try not to over-rely on only subsidy or insurance. Instead, through a combination of subsidy, MediShield Life and MediSave, and maintaining some co-payment from patients, we try to keep healthcare affordable. As a result, our national healthcare spending is under 5% of the gross domestic product as of 2022, which is significantly lower than the 10% to 12% of other developed economies.

    "speaker": "Mr Desmond Lee",
    "speech": "Mr Desmond Lee\n: The projected ultimate number of dwelling units in the Housing and Development Board's (HDB's) Annual Report is an estimate of the dwelling units that HDB towns can accommodate when fully developed. This figure is only a planning parameter and not a target to be reached. It is regularly updated as it is affected by several variables which can change over time.\nFor example, in recent years, we have observed trends, such as strong household formation rates and smaller household sizes, contributing to strong broad-based housing demand. This has resulted in an increase in the estimated number of households in the Singapore population which are eligible to purchase public housing flats. Consequently, we have set aside more residential land within existing towns and new areas, such as Bayshore under Bedok town and Ulu Pandan under Queenstown. As a result, since the 2019/2020 Annual Report, town boundaries were expanded and the estimated number of ultimate residential dwelling units has increased.\nIn response to these housing demand trends, HDB has adjusted its housing mix and built more flats. This is unlike the proposal from the Workers' Party in 2019 that recommended HDB to cut back its building programme from around 16,000 to 17,000 dwelling units to around 9,000 dwelling units every year. Had we followed the recommendation, we would have faced a serious shortage of housing supply, longer waiting times and much higher prices for resale flats.",

    "section_title": "Social Residential Homes Bill ",
    "speaker": "Mr Eric Chua",
    "speech": "Mr Eric Chua\n: Mr Speaker, I thank the Members for the robust debate and support for the Social Residential Homes Bill. Let me now respond to the Members’ questions and suggestions.\nFirstly, on measures to ensure residents’ safety and well-being. Mr Yip Hon Weng asked why MSF does not stipulate minimum staffing ratios for Homes in the Bill. Today, all Homes funded by MSF, which includes most Homes licensed under the existing Homes for the Aged Act and Children and Young Persons Act, need to abide by minimum staffing ratios set out by MSF. This Bill will allow MSF to set out minimum staffing ratios for all licensed Homes.\nMr Melvin Yong also asked about the evolution of sector standards over the years. As mentioned in my opening speech, we have enhanced our care models. In addition to Children’s Homes, Adult Disability Homes, Sheltered Homes and Welfare Homes have also adopted a tiered approach to provide more intensive care and targeted support to residents with higher care needs. As the sector continues to grow, our standards of care will also evolve to meet changing needs.\nMr Louis Ng asked about the types of duties carried out by individuals who require MSF’s approval prior to deployment in the Home. Broadly, these duties would include first, those relating to the overall governance, leadership and management of the Home, such as management of the Home’s financial accounts. We want to be sure that any individual who takes on any leadership or management responsibilities, such as key appointment holders and person-in-charge, is of good standing.\nSecond, those involving direct unsupervised contact with residents, such as helping residents who are less mobile with their personal hygiene and meals. This is so that we do not place vulnerable residents at undue risk of harm through exposure to individuals with a record of egregious offences.\nMr Ng also asked how long the pre-approval would take and also, support for Homes with recruitment planning. Generally, we endeavour to inform Homes of the outcome of the assessment within two weeks. Concurrently, MSF is reviewing ways to complete the process even faster, including through streamlining or automating some parts of the suitability assessment processes.\nMs Ng Ling Ling asked about the accuracy of background checks on foreign staff. Under this Bill, all prospective foreign staff in licensed Homes will be required to submit a self-declaration if they had committed any offence in any country, as specified by MOM. If we find out that a false declaration had been made, the individual may be liable to regulatory actions under the Bill, such as cancellation of approval to work in the Home, and/or prosecution under the Penal Code.\nMr Yong asked about the number of cases of Home staff that were investigated and taken to task for excessive use of force. Such cases are fortunately uncommon. Over the 2020 to 2024 period, MSF received an average of six reports per year on resident abuse, including that of excessive use of force. Several were not substantiated, and where substantiated, staff were taken to task. MSF adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards the use of excessive force on our residents and will thoroughly investigate these allegations.\nMr Yip suggested creating a public rating system for Homes, so that family members and the public will be made aware if a Home is performing poorly. To address the Member’s underlying concern on accountability, MSF works closely with Homes in the case of incidents to ensure that residents and their family members are aware of the situation, what is being done to address the concerns and to involve them in decisions regarding their care arrangements, where possible. We will consider practices in other countries to strengthen public accountability. The goal should be to help the Homes enhance their performance and accountability, and create a culture of continual improvement.\nMr Yip and Mr Yong would also be assured to know that we have multiple channels in place for residents and family members to provide feedback on Homes. A Board of Visitors consisting of independent members of the community, such as private and social sector professionals, will visit Homes at least once a quarter. The Board of Visitors may also visit certain Homes more frequently, if there is a need to monitor them more closely. These visits are unannounced to enable the Board of Visitors to check on residents’ living conditions and speak with residents to hear any concerns they may have.\nResidents and their family members may also provide their feedback to MSF via our hotline or email. Through these channels, we can promptly address concerns and foster greater accountability from Homes.\nMr Dennis Tan asked if there were any shortfalls or uneven standards of care across the Homes. As mentioned in my opening speech earlier, MSF introduced this Bill to codify the good progress that has been made in raising the quality of care over the years. It is not in response to uneven standards of care or any incidents of a serious nature.\nMr Yong raised a few questions on the Singapore Boys’ Home and Singapore Girls’ Home. In particular, the reasons for excluding them from this Bill, whether these Homes are subjected to the same standards in this Bill and who is responsible for ensuring the quality of care in these Homes.\nThe Singapore Boys’ Home and the Singapore Girls’ Home are operated by the Government and are excluded from the licensing regime under this Bill. However, this does not mean that they do not need to meet the standards of care. In fact, they are held to the same standards, if not higher. To ensure good quality care is provided in the Singapore Boys’ Home and Singapore Girls’ Home, these Homes are subjected to independent inspections, as well as regular visits by a Review Board. Similar to the Board of Visitors, the Review Board comprises independent members of the community, who review the living standards and standards of care in these Homes.\nNext, I will address the queries raised on the enforcement framework against errant operators.\nMr Louis Ng and Mr Yip Hon Weng asked if MSF will have a framework to decide when the step-in powers will be exercised and which arrangements will be ordered. The answer to this is yes. In determining when and how to exercise the step-in powers, MSF will thoroughly assess the facts of each case, such as the severity of harm caused to residents. I wish to emphasise that these step-in powers are meant to be a measure of last resort, after all other avenues are exhausted. Accordingly, the use of step-in powers will cease once the operations of the affected home have stabilised and we are assured of the residents' safety and wellbeing.\nMr Yong asked about the number of homes that have required a change of operators in the past 10 years. Thus far, only one home underwent a change of operator as the operator had decided not to continue running the home following a thorough evaluation of the organisation's resources and strategic direction. MSF, the affected home as well as the incoming home operator worked closely to ensure a smooth transition for staff and continuity of care for residents.\nMr Ng and Mr Yong also asked how MSF would prepare other licensed homes to take over the operations or residents of a failing home. MSF will work closely with both the incoming and outgoing operators to facilitate the handover processes, including the care arrangements for residents during the step-in period. We will also ensure that capacity is sufficient. Our priority is to ensure that the continuity of care for residents in the affected home is assured.\nTo be clear, activating another licensed home to step-in is only one option that MSF may take under step-in powers. Other options, include appointing a third-party to advise the licensee on the home's operations or revoking the appointment of an existing key appointment holder and reappointing another individual to take over the responsibilities.\nMr Ng asked whether whistle-blowing protections under clause 53 apply to individuals who report offences under the Bill to the Police. The whistle-blower will be referred to the MSF inspecting officers to assist investigations of the offence and will be conferred protection under clause 53.\nMr Yip asked if whistle-blowers would be constrained in reporting poor living or care conditions because of the restriction on publishing information about residents. The answer is no. Clause 38 protects the identities of residents in these homes from being published or broadcasted. Whistle-blowers come to MSF to share information privately rather than broadcast identifiable details of clients in the public sphere.\nIn addition, under clause 53(2) of the Bill on whistle-blowing, a person who whistle-blows to MSF in good faith cannot be held in any legal proceedings with respect to any restriction on disclosure imposed by any rule of law. Such a provision was included in our Bill precisely to encourage whistle-blowers to step forward if they have such concerns.\nMs Ng Ling Ling raised several questions on the level of approval for the Codes of Practice, calibration of penalties for breaches of Codes of Practice and the lines of accountability for regulatory breaches.\nFirst, the Codes of Practice that are issued to homes are approved by the Director-General. Second, the type of regulatory action taken will be calibrated, depending on factors, such as degree of harm caused and if it is a repeated breach by the home. In some cases, we may suspend approval of specific individuals working in the home. In others, we may shorten a home's licence while giving the home guidance on issues that need to be rectified. Third, in deciding who to take regulatory actions on, please be assured that we have every intention to be fair and reasonable. We will not be overly punitive to our stakeholders.\nAllow me to illustrate with a hypothetical example. We intend to introduce a regulatory requirement on the licensee to ensure that staff are adequately trained. If a staff member of the home fails to meet the minimum first aid training requirements and is, thus, unable to promptly attend to residents' need for first aid, we may take action against the licensee.\nMr Yong expressed concern that the enhanced penalties may be excessive and could inadvertently discourage operators or staff from joining the sector. The penalties under this Bill are commensurate with that of comparable offences under other legislation. One notable example is the Healthcare Services Act, which licenses the provision of nursing home service.\nMuch like our homes, residents in nursing homes are vulnerable and reliant on the home for 24/7 care. The safety and well-being of our homes' residents are no less important.\nWe recognise that some homes may be anxious about the enhanced penalties. To provide the various stakeholder groups, such as board members, with greater clarity about their duties, we will set out their roles and responsibilities in the Subsidiary Legislation and Codes of Practice. We will not be punitive from the outset. Instead, we will work closely with homes to ensure that they are well-supported to meet the regulatory requirements under this Bill.\nNext, I will move on to questions and suggestions pertaining to capability building for our homes.\nMr Melvin Yong and Mr Dennis Tan asked about the regulatory costs arising from this Bill and the support to homes to transit to the new licensing regime. We do not expect the regulatory costs to be significantly higher than today, as the requirements build upon existing legislation and service requirements that homes are familiar with. Nonetheless, MSF and NCSS have set aside a $33 million Transition Support Package for all licensable homes.\nMr Tan will be pleased to know that with this funding, homes will be able to invest in training for staff, updating or installing CCTV systems and change management efforts as they transit to this new licensing regime. Funding will be customised based on the needs of each home.\nIn addition to the one-off Transition Support Package, Ms Ng and Mr Yong suggested setting up a long-term capability building fund to support homes in building up their operational capabilities and staff competencies.\nInvesting in sector capabilities is one of our key priorities and we have several schemes and grants available to help social service agencies level up. NCSS administers the Transformation Sustainability Scheme that provides funding to social service agencies to enhance their strategic and organisational capabilities. With this funding, social service agencies are supported in improving staff retention, strengthening volunteer engagement and thereafter, successfully delivering on other capability-building projects.\nThe Charities Capability Fund, formerly known as VCF that Ms Ng mentioned, continues to be available to social service agencies. It covers a range of capability building matters, including governance and management training for charities' board members and staff.\nMs Ng suggested exploring bulk procurement of common equipment to optimise public funds and resources available to the homes. We thank her for the suggestion. MSF and NCSS will work with social service agencies to optimise resource utilisation and adopt solutions that would best meet their needs.\nMr Yip and Mr Yong asked if staff in our homes are paid fairly and are sufficiently supported to ensure that they do not burn out while caring for residents. Mr Dennis Tan asked a related question about how we intend to support homes' manpower needs.\nWe are invested in the manpower sustainability of this sector. In my Opening speech, I shared about our reviews of the Skills and Salary Guidelines to ensure that staff are paid competitively and about NCSS working closely with social service agencies to develop stronger organisational capabilities and a supportive workplace environment.\nTo attract and retain talent in the sector, MSF has also embarked on a job redesign pilot with selected homes. Through this pilot, we hope to enhance the value proposition of a career in the sector, specifically, by improving the working conditions and supporting the career development of care staff.\nMr Yip also asked about the support that MSF provides to ensure that homes have sufficient trained caregivers, including those from foreign countries, and whether foreign worker ratios need to be relaxed. To this end, MSF will continue to work with MOM to ensure that homes have sufficient work pass quota and flexibility to recruit foreign care staff whilst also ensuring opportunities for local staff to progress in their careers.\nMr Yip spoke about the need for adequate capacity. MSF keeps a close eye on the demand and supply of the capacity of our homes. For Adult Disability Homes, which includes Adult Disability Hostels, we are actively addressing waitlist management through several initiatives. We are expanding capacity by adding new facilities and are optimising placement processes to ensure cases with urgent needs are prioritised.\nAdditionally, we are strengthening community-based support services to provide alternatives to residential care, where appropriate. One example is the Enabled Living Programme pilot, which is an alternative to residential care and seeks to enable persons with disabilities to live and age in the community.\nWe will continue to ensure sufficient capacity to meet projected demand over the long term, an issue that Mr Yong also spoke about.\nAs caregivers age and with shrinking family sizes, we expect a slight increase in demand over the next decade. At the same time, MSF and the Ministry of Health are ramping up our support for persons with disabilities and seniors to age in place and for those in homes to be reintegrated more quickly back to the community so that fewer of them need to stay in institutional care.\nWith the slight increase in demand, manpower needs will also increase. We will continue to invest in technology and process redesign to enhance workforce productivity.\nRelatedly, Mr Yip noted that the Bill empowers the Director-General to set capacity limits on homes and expressed concern that this could lead to turning residents in need away. To be clear, the key objective of setting capacity limits is to ensure that quality care can be provided to residents. These limits are determined based on practical considerations, which include, physical space requirements, infrastructure capabilities and staffing ratios. As I had mentioned earlier, MSF will continue to monitor demand and supply trends to ensure sufficient capacity.\nMr Tan asked why the Bill would need to provide for the possibility of housing different client types or profiles together. Let me share an example. Some seniors may have acquired disability while some persons with disabilities have aged and have become seniors themselves, so we may need to equip our homes to cater to both types of needs.\nWe are in the early stages of reviewing how the sector can evolve over the longer term to improve care quality, leverage technology and build capabilities for better client outcomes. We will work closely with the sector to co-create the future of social residential homes.\nEarlier, Ms Ng expressed her appreciation to the individuals who have readily volunteered to be members of the Board of Visitors. I echo Ms Ng's appreciation for Board of Visitors volunteers and would like to share the example of one such volunteer.\nMs Sharifah Masturah Shahab-Yokoyama. She is a veteran special educator with over 30 years of experience working with children and adults with developmental needs. As the Vice Chairperson of one of our Boards of Visitors, Ms Sharifah used her expertise to provide valuable insights to homes on how they can improve the care they provide to residents.\nVolunteers like Ms Sharifah play a pivotal role in ensuring that good quality care is provided to residents. Let me share an example from the Singapore Boys' Hostel, a children's home. The Board of Visitors had alerted the management team to feedback from residents on the lack of variety in meals. To address this, the Singapore Boys' Hostel has engaged two caterers to provide greater variety in the food menu.\nThe close partnership between homes, Boards of Visitors and MSF ensures that residents' voices are heard, a point that Mr Yip earlier alluded to with his suggestion for a separate Residents' Bill of Rights to engender dignity, choice and respect for residents. Under this Bill, MSF will be expanding the Boards of Visitors to cover all these licensable homes. I would like to call upon more interested individuals with the relevant experience and expertise to step forward as our volunteers and join MSF in this journey of caring for the most vulnerable amongst us.\nMr Speaker, having addressed the comments and suggestions raised by Members, I would now like to take this opportunity to place on record, my deepest appreciation for staff in these homes. Many of us may not be familiar with the work that these homes do and the residents that they care for. This is because the majority of our 4,000 residents live in the homes 24/7.\nToday, I want to spotlight the dedication of staff in these homes. These 4,000 residents are cared for by about 2,000 staff, many of whom are care staff doing shift work to supervise and assist residents with their activities of daily living. Social workers are another key group that play an important role in journeying with the resident through the challenges and milestones in life. Many of the residents have no one else in their lives to advocate for their needs and to ensure they have access to various resources and opportunities, except for these staff.\nTo be clear, the work that the home staff do is tough. It is not for the faint-hearted. But it is extremely meaningful.\nUnder their care, residents are given the help they need to facilitate their recovery, to preserve their health and cognitive functions and be meaningfully engaged. Residents with the potential to live independently or return to their families are also equipped with relevant independent living skills, such as personal care, household chores, budgeting, money management, social skills and help-seeking skills. This ensures that residents are set up for success when they are reintegrated back into society.\nI want to share the story of Beatrice, a resident of Thuja Home at Pelangi Village. Beatrice was admitted into the Welfare Home in December 2019 with schizophrenia. Over the years, staff in Thuja Home worked closely with Beatrice in various areas. This includes regular check-ins as well as referrals for psychoeducation and employment. With their care and guidance, Beatrice succeeded in securing employment. Today, she has secured a Housing and Development Board rental flat and will soon be discharged from the home.\nTo the staff in our homes, thank you for all that you do. Your dedication to uplifting the lives of those in need is the reason why residents, like Beatrice, can rebuild their lives, regain independence and step into the future filled with hope.\nFinally, I thank Members for their support for this Bill. I believe this Bill is a much-needed step as we strive to uphold the good quality of care provided to residents across the sector and ensure that every single resident is kept safe and well in our homes. [\nApplause.\n]\n4.03 pm\nMr Speaker\n:",

    "speech": "(Ms Low Yen Ling) (for t\nhe Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of State for Trade and Industry)\n: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, I move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\nSir, the Competition (Amendment) Bill amends the Competition Act 2004 and the Enterprise Singapore Board Act 2018 to transfer the product safety and legal metrology functions from the Enterprise Singapore Board to the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS). Related amendments will also be made to the Consumer Protection (Trade Descriptions and Safety Requirements) Act 1975 and the Weights and Measures Act 1975.\nSince taking over the fair-trading function from then-SPRING Singapore in 2018, CCCS has deepened its expertise and established itself as one of the key pillars underpinning our consumer protection ecosystem today. It works closely with relevant Government agencies and the Consumers Association of Singapore to promote consumer education and awareness. CCCS also takes action against unfair practices under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act 2003 (or CPFTA). It plays an important role in safeguarding consumer interests, ensuring they can transact with businesses with peace of mind.\nProduct safety and the accurate measurement of products are vital in protecting consumer interests. Today, product safety and legal metrology functions are administered by Enterprise Singapore’s Consumer Product Safety Office (CPSO), and the Weights and Measures Office (WMO), respectively. This results in the consumer protection functions to reside across two agencies.\nTo ensure greater synergy in the administration and enforcement of consumer protection matters under a single agency, the Bill amendments seek to transfer the product safety and legal metrology functions from Enterprise Singapore to CCCS. Such a move would reinforce the mandate of CCCS’ to protect consumers by enhancing its oversight of consumer protection issues.\nSir, I will now explain the key features of the Bill.\nThe Bill will transfer the following functions from Enterprise Singapore to CCCS, namely:\nOne, promoting the supply of safe consumer goods among suppliers in Singapore and educating consumers on safety information of the goods they buy and legal metrology.\nTwo, preventing the supply of unsafe consumer goods in Singapore.\nThree, the administration and enforcement of the Weights and Measures Act, including the regulation of weighing and measuring instruments used for trade, the provision of relevant information relating to quantity in the supply of goods, and enforcement actions against suppliers whose goods are short-weighted.\nFour, representing Singapore internationally and advising Government agencies and consumer protection organisations on promoting and enforcing the supply of safe consumer goods in Singapore, including providing relevant safety information about consumer goods and legal metrology.\nThe Bill will also empower CCCS to designate or recognise persons who perform conformity assessment, testing or certification related to product safety of consumer goods, to regulate such persons, or to carry out the conformity assessment or testing itself. CCCS will also be empowered to administer and enforce certain regulations under Consumer Protection (Trade Descriptions and Safety Requirements) Act, including regulations relating to the supply of safe consumer goods. This further complements the existing enforcement functions against unfair practices under the CPFTA.\nIf passed, all assets, liabilities and records of the CPSO and WMO in Enterprise Singapore will be transferred to CCCS. Enterprise Singapore and CCCS will ensure smooth continuity of operations and provide support to the public and industry stakeholders. We will engage with all relevant stakeholders in the lead-up to the transfer.\nSir, this Bill will better position CCCS to address issues relating to unfair trading, product safety and legal metrology holistically, thereby strengthening CCCS’ ability to safeguard consumer interests. Sir, I beg to move.\n[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]\nMr Deputy Speaker\n:",

Across Singapore, we currently have 10 completed SIP facilities, including in Boon Lay, Sembawang and Sengkang. There are plans for the development of more SIP projects. We will announce the plans for these SIPs when the plans are firmed up.\nPlanning and including the siting for public sport facilities, including SIP facilities, is done at the national level, considering a range of different factors. These include, the nature of facilities already available, a site's proximity to other existing and upcoming locations of sports and recreational facilities, availability of suitable sites, town population size and popularity of sports.\nThe cost of an SIP facility depends on several factors, such as market conditions at the time of tender and the size and type of facilities being built.",

Eligible first-timers (FTs) can receive an Enhanced CPF (Central Provident Fund) Housing Grant (EHG) of up to $120,000 when they buy a new or resale flat. To help young couples who want to settle down earlier, the Deferred Income Assessment (DIA) scheme allows eligible couples to apply for a new flat first and defer their income assessment for EHG and the Housing and Development Board (HDB) housing loan nearer to key collection, when their incomes are more stable and likely higher.\nIn 2024, fewer than 200 FT households, where at least one party was aged 30 and below, did not qualify for both (a) EHG as they did not meet the continuous employment condition, and (b) the DIA, but HDB does not track the reasons for disqualification as requested by the Member. They formed fewer than 2% of all FT couples in this age group.\nWe expect the number of young households who do not qualify for these schemes to decrease. From the July 2025 sales exercise, we will expand the DIA scheme to require only one party of a couple to be a full-time student or National Serviceman, or have recently been one, instead of both of them.\nWe understand that each young couple's life journey is unique and we will continue to review our policies to support their housing aspirations.",

    "speaker": "Dr Tan See Leng",
    "speech": "Dr Tan See Leng\n: Based on a fixed annual capitation rate achieved through risk pooling, the Primary Care Plan (PCP) provides employers with peace of mind, offering cost certainty while protecting against unexpected medical expenses. Migrant workers pay a small co-payment fee per consultation, but there is no cap on the number of times a worker can consult a doctor. PCP covers the cost of basic medication and also includes an annual basic health screening or medical examination for work pass issuance or renewal, basic laboratory tests and x-ray examination. This model of primary care allows doctors to intervene early and undertake preventive care and chronic disease management to enable more effective care and disease control, and lowers long-term healthcare cost for employers.\nOn average, the monthly utilisation for care sought by migrant workers enrolled on PCP is about 12%. This means each worker would seek care through PCP one to two times a year, which is broadly in line with our projections at the start of the scheme. Utilisation can vary from month to month, for example when there are surges in acute respiratory infections. However, PCP is currently underutilised for annual basic health screening and chronic care management. Employers save at least 20% when compared to the total estimated annual cost of similar treatments and medical services at general practitioner clinics.\nIn a National University of Singapore Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health study published in September 2024, 88% of migrant workers expressed willingness to utilise PCP due to affordability and accessibility of its medical centres and in-dormitory clinics. The majority of migrant workers are satisfied with the services under PCP based on the surveys conducted. Feedback from employers also suggests that PCP has lowered the medical costs for similar treatments and medical services for migrant workers in general. The Ministry of Manpower will continue to engage the migrant workers and employers to encourage early care seeking, including preventive care and early management of chronic conditions.",

While some are due to unfortunate circumstances, such as divorce, there are also transactions done for commercial reasons. For example, when one of the co-owners under the Joint Singles Scheme sells his or her share of the flat to an unrelated third-party. As such, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) treats all resale of part-share no differently from a typical resale transaction. This includes subjecting the remaining owners and any incoming owners to a fresh Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), which starts from the day the transaction is legally completed.\nHowever, HDB waives the need to serve a fresh MOP for majority of resale of part-share cases due to divorce.

Signs of child abuse or neglect and the legal obligation to report to ECDA are covered in the training curriculum for all educators.\nIn 2021, the ECDC Code of Practice was updated to include additional operational guidelines and workflows to guide preschools on actions to take if there are suspicions that a child is being abused. Preschools are now required to use the Sector-Specific Screening Guide, a standardised assessment tool, to assess signs of abuse or neglect and report any child abuse concerns to ECDA within 24 hours. If there are concerns about sexual abuse, noticeable injuries or signs of immediate threat to the child's safety, preschools are required to consult the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline (NAVH) within two hours.\nSince 2021, ECDA introduced protocols relating to the withdrawal or frequent absence from preschool. If a child with child abuse concerns has been regularly absent or is withdrawn from preschool without valid reasons, preschools are required to inform the social worker or the Ministry of Social and Family Development's (MSF's) Child Protection Officer working with the child. If the child is not known to any social service agency or MSF's Child Protective Service (CPS), preschools must report the matter to ECDA, which will then assess whether a report to CPS is necessary.\nAside from preschools, frontline professionals in schools, healthcare institutions and social service agencies are also trained in the use of assessment tools to pick up safety concerns involving children and to intervene based on established protocols. Any member of public, including whistle-blowers, should call the 24-hour NAVH, make an online report via the MSF website or LifeSG app to report suspected child abuse, or call the Police if there is imminent danger to a child.

Such a scheme is not appropriate for businesses supplying food and essential items, such as the supermarket sector, as the prices of these items are subject to global market conditions, like supply chain disruptions and cost fluctuations. Providing funding support to these businesses may distort market prices and undermine fair and healthy competition.\nAs a small and open economy that imports most of our supplies for food and essential items, the Government's priority is to diversify our import sources and promote free market competition, so that businesses will price their goods competitively and provide consumers with more choices.\nThe Government recognises that households continue to face cost of living challenges. To address this, we have rolled out further enhancements to the Assurance Package as announced at Budget 2025. These include $800 in Community Development Council Vouchers in financial year 2025 for all Singaporean households to defray their daily expenses as well as additional U-Save for eligible HDB households to cope with their utilities expenses.\nSocial enterprises and industry partners also have a part to play in expanding households' access to value-for-money products and equipping consumers with the tools to make informed choices. For example, the FairPrice Group has introduced various initiatives to help moderate the cost of living for Singaporeans, such as by controlling price increases for selected essential items, offering regular discounts for Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) card holders and seniors and giving special SG60 discounts for its Own Brands products. Consumers can also use the Price Kaki app developed by the Consumers Association of Singapore to compare prices of hawker food and daily essentials across different stalls and shops and stretch their dollar.",

My response will also cover questions raised by Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim scheduled for subsequent Sittings.\nSingapore remains gravely concerned about the resumption of hostilities in Gaza which has resulted in a further loss of civilian life and internal displacement of the Palestinians. The dire humanitarian situation in Gaza has worsened as aid has not been allowed in since 2 March 2025. Singapore has consistently called for all parties in the conflict to comply with international law, including international humanitarian law, and ensure that all civilians are kept out of harm's way. Civilian infrastructure, including medical facilities as well as medical workers, must be accorded due protection. We call on Israel to facilitate the resumption of critical life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza. Such aid must not be used as a bargaining chip. We also call on Hamas to release all remaining hostages immediately and unconditionally. We urge all parties to resume negotiations and make progress towards a permanent ceasefire.\nSingapore is committed to supporting international relief efforts for Gaza. While Israeli restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza are in place, we have continued to explore ways to provide humanitarian assistance with our partners in the Middle East. We will also look to contribute towards supporting post-conflict recovery efforts in partnership with the United Nations (UN) and others in the region. The needs in Gaza will be significant and Singapore will do our part to help.\nMinister for Defence Ng Eng Hen has stated in his speech at the Committee of Supply last month that the Singapore Armed Forces is also making plans to provide further medical assistance to the people in Gaza. We are assessing the possibility of such deployments in close coordination with our regional partners, taking into account the ground conditions, including safety. We have not received any requests on transporting Palestinian patients who may need more complex care to Singapore to-date, but such requests would have to be carefully assessed, taking into account the relevant medical risk factors, especially those associated with long-distance transport of patients needing complex care and treatment options.\nBoth the Israelis and Palestinians are well aware of our longstanding position, that the only viable path for achieving a comprehensive, just and durable solution to the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Our positions on the need to adhere to international law, including international humanitarian law, the need to refrain from unilateral actions which hinder or delay progress on a peace process and the need to ensure the protection of civilians, are also clear. We will continue to vote in support of relevant UN General Assembly resolutions that are consistent with our principled positions. At the same time, we need to be circumspect and recognise our limitations in influencing the outcome of this war and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It falls, ultimately, on the leaders on both sides to find the political will, courage and imagination to resume negotiations to resolving this longstanding conflict, difficult as it may be.\nIn our region, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states have been aligned on the core issues. Specifically, ASEAN has consistently supported the call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, immediate release of hostages, provision of humanitarian assistance and a negotiated two-state solution. Earlier this year, the ASEAN Foreign Ministers issued a statement reaffirming our longstanding support for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to their homeland.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs was in touch with the Mercy Relief team that visited the West Bank in March 2025. They are professionals with long experience operating and implementing humanitarian assistance projects in challenging environments. I commend them for their efforts to help Palestinians on behalf of Singapore.\nSingaporeans have responded to the Gaza conflict with a deep sense of empathy and compassion. I thank Singaporeans for contributing to humanitarian aid efforts for Gaza. We encourage everyone to continue supporting local fundraising efforts by reputable organisations, such as the Singapore Red Cross and Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation, which have extensive experience in working with a wide network of credible and reliable partners to effectively deliver critical aid on the ground.

    "speech": "Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\n: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Leaders review the situation in Myanmar regularly. In their latest review last October, they expressed deep concern over the escalation of the conflict and the humanitarian situation there. They urged all stakeholders and parties in Myanmar, in particular, the armed forces and security forces concerned, to de-escalate violence and stop attacks on civilians and public facilities.\nThe safe, effective and transparent delivery of humanitarian assistance without discrimination remains a priority under ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus. The ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre), with support from ASEAN member states, external partners, the United Nations and the private sector, has delivered several tranches of aid so far.\nThe 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck central Myanmar on 28 March 2025 has worsened the already dire humanitarian situation. Singapore responded quickly and was one of the first foreign countries to provide assistance through our 80-member strong Operation Lionheart Urban Search and Rescue contingent. We have also deployed the Singapore Emergency Medical Team (SGEMT), comprising a team of over 30 medical, technical and administrative personnel, to provide emergency services and medical care in the field. The Singapore Government has contributed $150,000 to match the Singapore Red Cross' (SRC's) seed money for the SRC’s fundraising efforts for quake victims as well as humanitarian supplies, like food, water filters and medical supplies, delivered by the Republic of Singapore Air Force aircraft to Myanmar.\nAt the emergency meeting of ASEAN Foreign Ministers on 30 March 2025, Singapore pledged to support ASEAN's efforts to expand humanitarian support coordinated by the AHA Centre. I called for an immediate and effective ceasefire in Myanmar, which would facilitate the efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and longer-term national reconciliation, peace and reconstruction. ASEAN will consider how our assistance can be augmented.\nIn the longer term, the reality is that the humanitarian situation can only be adequately addressed through genuine national reconciliation and constructive dialogue among all the key stakeholders, to help the people of Myanmar to achieve an inclusive, comprehensive and durable peaceful resolution that is Myanmar-owned and -led, as envisaged in the Five-Point Consensus.",

    "speaker": "Mr K Shanmugam",
    "speech": "Mr K Shanmugam\n: At the stage of the Police investigations, guilt is yet to be established by the Courts. We need, therefore, to consider carefully if we need to hold the accused in custody or it is safe enough to release him on bail.\nIn such decisions, the Police will consider factors, such as whether the alleged offence is bailable under the Criminal Procedure Code, the gravity of the offence, the danger of the offence being continued or repeated and whether the person had attempted to abscond previously. The Police will impose bail conditions as necessary if they grant the accused bail, including the condition that he must not commit any offence while released on bail.\nWhen an accused commits a new offence while on bail, he is likely to have breached a bail condition and have his bail revoked. In deciding whether to release the accused on bail again, the Police will take into account his breach of the bail condition, in addition to the factors I have mentioned earlier. If assessed suitable for bail again, the Police are likely to increase the bail amount or impose further bail conditions.\nA conditional warning is issued to an offender in lieu of prosecution. That is, the Public Prosecutor will not prosecute him for the current offence, on condition that he does not commit any offence within the specified period of the conditional warning. When determining whether to issue a conditional warning at the conclusion of the Police's investigations, the Public Prosecutor considers factors, such as the gravity of the offence, the likelihood of reoffending and past offences committed by the person. In particular, whether the offence is similar in nature to the past offences and how much time has passed between the offences.\nThese are the general considerations for bail and conditional warnings. It is not possible to exhaustively describe the considerations, as each case will, ultimately, be assessed on its own unique facts and circumstances.",

My response will also cover questions raised by Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim scheduled for subsequent Sittings.\nSingapore remains gravely concerned about the resumption of hostilities in Gaza, which has resulted in a further loss of civilian life and internal displacement of the Palestinians. The dire humanitarian situation in Gaza has worsened as aid has not been allowed in since 2 March 2025. Singapore has consistently called for all parties in the conflict to comply with international law, including international humanitarian law, and ensure that all civilians are kept out of harm's way. Civilian infrastructure, including medical facilities as well as medical workers, must be accorded due protection. We call on Israel to facilitate the resumption of critical life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza. Such aid must not be used as a bargaining chip. We also call on Hamas to release all remaining hostages immediately and unconditionally. We urge all parties to resume negotiations and make progress towards a permanent ceasefire.\nSingapore is committed to supporting international relief efforts for Gaza. While Israeli restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza are in place, we have continued to explore ways to provide humanitarian assistance with our partners in the Middle East. We will also look to contribute towards supporting post-conflict recovery efforts in partnership with the United Nations (UN) and others in the region. The needs in Gaza will be significant and Singapore will do our part to help.\nThe Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen has stated in his speech at the Committee of Supply last month that the Singapore Armed Forces is also making plans to provide further medical assistance to the people in Gaza. We are assessing the possibility of such deployments in close coordination with our regional partners, taking into account the ground conditions, including safety. We have not received any requests on transporting Palestinian patients who may need more complex care to Singapore to date, but such requests would have to be carefully assessed, taking into account the relevant medical risk factors especially those associated with long distance transport of patients needing complex care and treatment options.\nBoth the Israelis and Palestinians are well aware of our long-standing position that the only viable path for achieving a comprehensive, just and durable solution to the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Our positions on the need to adhere to international law, including international humanitarian law, the need to refrain from unilateral actions which hinder or delay progress on a peace process, and the need to ensure the protection of civilians, are also clear. We will continue to vote in support of relevant UN General Assembly resolutions that are consistent with our principled positions. At the same time, we need to be circumspect and recognise our limitations in influencing the outcome of this war and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It falls ultimately on the leaders on both sides to find the political will, courage and imagination to resume negotiations to resolve this long-standing conflict, difficult as it may be.\nIn our region, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Member States have been aligned on the core issues. Specifically, ASEAN has consistently supported the call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, immediate release of hostages, provision of humanitarian assistance and a negotiated two-state solution. Earlier this year, the ASEAN Foreign Ministers issued a statement reaffirming our longstanding support for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to their homeland.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs was in touch with the Mercy Relief team that visited the West Bank in March 2025. They are professionals with long experience operating and implementing humanitarian assistance projects in challenging environments. I commend them for their efforts to help Palestinians on behalf of Singapore.\nSingaporeans have responded to the Gaza conflict with a deep sense of empathy and compassion. I thank Singaporeans for contributing to humanitarian aid efforts for Gaza. We encourage everyone to continue supporting local fundraising efforts by reputable organisations, such as the Singapore Red Cross and Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation, which have extensive experience in working with a wide network of credible and reliable partners to effectively deliver critical aid on the ground. Donors can check via the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth's Charity Portal if the fundraiser is a registered charity in Singapore; and possesses a valid fundraising permit for foreign charitable purposes from the Commissioner of Charities.",

    "speaker": "Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M",
    "speech": "Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M\n: The preschool had observed visible injuries on the child and submitted to the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) an incident report prepared by the community worker from its affiliated social service agency. However, the report did not fully describe the severity of the injuries. This resulted in inadequate interventions by the relevant agencies.\nThe Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has since enhanced protocols to strengthen the child protection ecosystem. This includes requiring preschools to use the Sector-Specific Screening Guide, a standardised assessment tool, to assess the situation and report any child abuse concern to ECDA within 24 hours. If there are concerns about sexual abuse, noticeable injuries or signs of immediate threat to the child's safety, preschools are required to consult the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline within two hours. To ensure more accurate assessments, preschools are now required to use a diagram to document visible injuries on the child, rather than to rely solely on written descriptions.\nThe Member may also wish to refer to the MSF's statement on \"Strengthening the Child Protection Ecosystem – Learning from the Past\" published on 8 April 2025 on the MSF's website. It explains how cases of child deaths are reviewed, with a view to identify critical lessons and systematically enhance protocols to strengthen the child protection ecosystem.",

    "section_title": "Timeline between Discovery of Corporate Misappropriation and Securing of Asset Freezing Orders",
    "speaker": "Mr K Shanmugam",
    "speech": "Mr K Shanmugam\n: The question relates to civil disputes, usually between two commercial parties. The Courts have the power to grant injunctions prohibiting the disposal of assets, also referred to as freezing orders or Mareva injunctions. The Courts have described it as one of the law's \"nuclear\" weapons. The Government does not track the statistics on the average duration to secure a freezing order. These are within the remit of the Courts.\nThe grant of freezing orders is the subject of extensive and established case law developed over several decades in Singapore and elsewhere. As with many aspects of civil procedure, the case law has been developed by the Courts based on commercial needs and also takes reference from international jurisprudence.\nThe current civil procedure framework allows applicants to obtain an injunction ex parte, and quickly in urgent cases. The ability to obtain an order to freeze a party's assets around the world, based on limited evidence, can be abused. The Courts have developed a framework, including requiring appropriate evidence, before such freezing orders are given, to try and reduce the scope for abuse. An abuse of the process can have serious implications on legitimate businesses. Hence, the Courts seek to strike the right balance between providing for expediency in obtaining the order and ensuring that the Court is satisfied that such an order should be given – the Court has to be satisfied that there is basis for such an order to be given and with suitable safeguards in place. This is reflected in the law and procedural rules developed by the Courts in Singapore and across many jurisdictions.\nWhile the current civil procedure framework does provide a process for parties to obtain a freezing order quickly, it may still be possible for unscrupulous persons to try and spirit assets away either before or even after a freezing order has been given. This is due to the differences in the laws of different countries, the nature of assets, which may vary and be in different places; and difficulties that applicants may have in establishing where a party's assets may be.\nImplicit in the Member's question is the suggestion that the evidentiary threshold for obtaining such orders should be lowered. The Member can, perhaps, explain which aspects of the evidentiary threshold should be lowered and why he thinks the current balance the Courts have arrived at are wrong, so that we can better consider his suggestion. In any such exercise, it must be borne in mind that lowering the threshold may also widen the scope for abuse by applicants. This can cause legitimate businesses to be unable to access their assets, local and overseas, and payments until the order can be set aside.",
