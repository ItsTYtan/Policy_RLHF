LIGHT DUES (REPEAL) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n2.40 p.m.\n\nThe Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nLet me begin by giving a brief history of the Singapore Light Dues Board. The Board was established on 1st March, 1957, under the provisions of the Light Dues Ordinance, 1957, and is responsible for the provision and maintenance of marine navigational aids. The Board, which consists of a Chairman and eight members, operates five lighthouses, and some Ill beacons and buoys. The operation, maintenance and improvement of navigational aids for the safe navigation of ships in Singapore waters is clearly a port function and should logically come under the ambit of the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) which has a Hydrographic Department dealing with surveys of Singapore waters. The Hydrographic Department, in conjunction with the Port Master's Department of the PSA, determines the location and recommends the type of navigational aids to be established. The purpose of this Bill\n\ntherefore is to transfer these functions relating to navigational aids to the PSA.\n\nWhen the Light Dues (Repeal) Bill comes into force, the Board will cease to exist and all its functions, liabilities, assets and staff will be transferred o the Port of Singapore Authority (Clause 3). The staff will be transferred to the service of the PSA on terms no less favourable than those enjoyed by them immediately prior to the date of coming into operation of this Bill (Clauses 4 and 5).\n\nThe transfer of the Light Dues Board's functions to the PSA will enable the Port to plan more efficiently its maritime activities within our waters and maintain the position of the Port of Singapore as one of the largest and safest ports in the world.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ang Kok Peng].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. PORT OF SINGAPORE AUTHORITY (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n2.43 p.m.\n\nThe Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nFirst of all, permit me to give a brief background of this Bill. The operational functions of the Marine Department include the licensing of harbour craft, port clearance, the dissemination of navigational information and the recovery of wrecks. These functions should properly be exercised by the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) whose Port Master is responsible for the seaward control of the harbour,\n\nharbour safety, tug services, berthing and piloting, as well as the supervision and direction of ships and shipping.\n\nThe prime objective of this Bill is to rationalise the distribution of maritime functions between the Marine Department and the PSA. The Bill proposes the transfer of the following functions of the Marine Department to the PSA:-\n\n(i) Licensing of harbour craft (Clause 12(a))\n\nThe PSA to have jurisdiction over the licensing of harbour craft which operate solely within port limits. Harbour craft are operated by certificated steersmen and the examination and issue of certificates to steersmen would then become the PSA's responsibility.\n\n(ii) Port entry and clearance (Clause 12 (c))\n\nSince control of shipping in port is the PSA's responsibility, it is only logical that this function is also exercised by the PSA. This will also simplify the collection of shipping statistics.\n\n(iii) Dissemination of navigational information (Clause 3 (b) paragraph (e))\n\nAt present the Marine Department issues notices to mariners while the Port Master issues notices to ships in the harbour. Since the PSA will take over the provision and maintenance of navigational aids and is also responsible for hydrographic work, the dissemination of navigational information should properly also be a function of the PSA.\n\n(iv) Recovery of wrecks\n\nWhile the Director of Marine is officially the receiver of wrecks, actual wreck recovery is undertaken by the PSA or by private firms since the Marine Department has no salvage facilities. This function should be the responsibility of the PSA as it relates to harbour safety.\n\nThe PSA will also take over from the Singapore Light Dues Board the responsibility for provision and maintenance of navigational aids for the safe\n\nnavigation of ships in Singapore waters (clause 3 (b) paragraph (d)).\n\nThe transfer of these functions which deal with shipping activities within the port, from the Marine Department to the PSA, is a logical move and is indeed necessary as a consequence of the growth of shipping in our port. When these functions are transferred to the PSA, the Marine Department will be able to concentrate on specialised marine matters so that Singapore's maritime interests are effectively advanced. This will enable us to take greater advantage of our strategic location as a major shipping and trade centre. The Department would be able to exert more efforts to enhance the attractiveness of the Singapore Registry of Ships by providing more efficient service to the 800 ships, totalling some 1.7 million gross registered tons, at present flying the Singapore flag.\n\nOpportunity is also taken to make other amendments to the Port of Singapore Authority Act, generally to tighten control of activities and operations within port waters. The Bill will enable the Port to effectively supervise the users of the seas around Singapore to ensure that they do not pollute the seas or rivers or cause navigational hazards (clause 13). The PSA will also be empowered to levy rates for removal of oil pollution and other services, and to levy dues, including garbage removal dues. Existing sections dealing with dues and rates are replaced with more comprehensive provisions to enable the PSA to charge proper dues and rates (clause 8).\n\nThe First Schedule to the Port of Singapore Authority Act is also amended to reduce the membership of the PSA from 14 to 9 and to make the period of office more flexible (clause 18). A compact Board will be able to discharge its functions more effectively and expeditiously. Present members will continue to serve until they complete their terms of office.\n\nI am confident that the PSA will achieve the basic objective of this reorganisation exercise which is to\n\neliminate wastage of manpower and resources, and to ensure greater efficiency and better co-ordination of personnel dealing with related shipping matters.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n2.51 p.m.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support most of the moves and the changes that are taking place in the PSA. But I am a little perturbed about one or two matters. Firstly, over the last two years, the PSA's work has increased. The Authority is taking over the function of the Light Dues Board. On one previous occasion I raised an objection to the Authority being in charge of pollution when we already have a Department in the Government to look into pollution problems. It is a well known fact that the PSA not only deals with matters concerning the port but it has also gone into business, like building houses for its staff and building hawker centres, not in conformity with the Government's policy of providing cheap housing for our citizens and of building cheap hawker centres for the hawkers. Can something be done about this?\n\nThe other point I want to raise is the reduction of membership of the PSA. At the moment, the NTUC is represented in the PSA. Will the reduction of membership affect the NTUC representation in the PSA?\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng: Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards cheap housing for the staff of the PSA, we will look into the matter to see whether the present housing scheme is really not sufficiently economical for them.\n\nAs regards the second question, the NTUC will be represented in the reconstituted PSA.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State missed the point about hawker centres.\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng: Mr Speaker, Sir, when I gave my answer about housing, I meant to include hawker centres in our consideration.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ang Kok Peng].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. MERCHANT SHIPPING (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n2.56 p.m.\n\nThe Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe amendments to be made to the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap. 172 of the Revised Edition) are a result of the transfer of certain functions of the Marine Department to the Port of Singapore Authority. This Bill proposes the following main changes:\n\n(i) the function of the Director of Marine in granting port clearance to vessels to be transferred to the Port Master (clauses 10 and 31);\n\n(ii) the examination and issue of certificates of competency as steersman to be the responsibility of the PSA (clauses 4 to 8 and 14);\n\n(iii) the PSA to have general supervision over all matters relating to wrecks in Singapore waters (clauses 15, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24 and 25);\n\n(iv) the PSA to have jurisdiction over the licensing of harbour craft which operate solely within port limits (clause 37); and\n\n(v) the Port Master to be empowered to detain or refuse port clearance to any ship which has failed to comply with our maritime laws (clause 33).\n\nThe following other changes are also proposed:-\n\n(a) the licensing of pilgrim brokers by the Deputy Commissioner of Police to be transferred to the Pilgrimage Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs (clauses 11, 12 and 13);\n\n(b) the Director of Marine or the Port Master to be empowered to prohibit any vessel from entering Singapore waters if it is not in the Republic's interest for the vessel to enter (clause 28). The purpose is to ensure that ships especially tankers which have suffered casualty may not be allowed to come in if there is risk of massive oil pollution.\n\nThe Marine Department staff, who are required to be transferred to the service of the PSA as a result of this exercise, will be transferred on terms as near as may be to those they had enjoyed immediately prior to their transfer (clause 45).\n\nI am confident that all these changes will enhance the efficiency of the Port. The streamlining of the functions of the Marine Department and the PSA will bring about better co-ordination which will result in a better service to our port users.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: Mr Speaker, Sir, if I remember correctly, in the Light Dues (Repeal) Bill where provision is made for the staff of the Marine Department to be transferred to the PSA, the Minister of State said that the transfer will be \"on terms no less favourable than those enjoyed by them\" in the previous department. But in this Bill, the phraseology is a little different. The Minister of State said that the transfer will be \"on terms as near as may be.\" I think that is not good enough because when staff is transferred, it should be on terms no less favourable than what they enjoy in the Marine Department. They are not responsible for the transfer from the Marine Department to the PSA.\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng: Mr Speaker, Sir, the intention is that the transfer is to be carried out in such a way that the staff will enjoy the benefits no less favourable than what they are enjoying at the moment.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Ang Kok Peng].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. SALE OF FOOD BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.03 p.m.\n\nThe Minister of State for the Environment (Mr Wee Toon Boon): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe Bill before the House is based on the existing Sale of Food and Drugs Act which was enacted in 1955. Major changes are, however, made in the new Bill to meet with changing circumstances and to provide for more effective control over the sale and preparation of food.\n\nThe new Bill provides measures to ensure the quality and purity of food. It seeks to prohibit the sale or other disposition or the use of articles dangerous or injurious to health. It also seeks to prevent deception and fraud arising out of the sale of food.\n\nA complementary Bill, to be known as The Food Handlers' Regulations, is being drafted. Its main purpose is to exercise control over all persons involved in the sale or preparation of food.\n\nThe Sale of Food Bill and The Food Handlers' Regulations will between them ensure that the required standards of health and hygiene are maintained.\n\nControl over advertisements relating to food and appliances connected with food has been extended to include printed or broadcast advertisements to prevent misleading of the public. There was no such provision in the existing Act, which controlled only labelling statements on packaged food.\n\nThe Act also provides control over appliances connected with food. There have been instances in the past in which food appliances of an insanitary or dangerous nature have been sold or used, but as control of such appliances was not covered in the existing Act, the prohibition of their use or sale could not be enforced.\n\nA further inclusion in the new Act provides for the definition of \"analysis\" of food to include micro-biological assay. The previous definition permitted only chemical analysis. The time limit during which legal proceedings may be instituted in respect of offences has also been extended from the original 28 days to 56 days from the time of purchasing a sample of the article or food or appliance. This is to provide sufficient time for a detailed analysis to be carried out, as the standard of food technology has now advanced to a stage which allows more complex methods of analysis to be performed.\n\nThe other provisions are, in the main, similar to those in the existing Act.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\nDr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just like to enquire about the appointment of the number of analysts. I was just wondering whether the Ministry concerned has its own facilities to carry out microbiological and chemical analyses. If it has, will it then not be a duplication of facilities in the other Government departments, like the Chemistry Department or the Bacteriology Department?\n\nMr Wee Toon Boon: Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to the point raised by the Member for River Valley, of course, all these analyses or tests will be referred to the Chemistry Department or the Bacteriology Department.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the the Bill. - [Mr Wee Toon Boon].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. CRECHE ESTABLISHMENTS BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.11 p.m.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe Creche Establishments Bill was introduced in Parliament on 16th February, 1973. This Bill, now before the House, seeks to provide for the licensing, control and supervision of creches so as to ensure that the education, health, safety and welfare of young children who are sent to such creches are adequately taken care of.\n\nRecent enquiries made by the Social Welfare Department revealed that a number of private creches are operating in residential areas. A few of these creches offer day-care service for preschool children, and in addition some of them offer residential care for infants and young children. Some of these private creches are operated by untrained or unqualified staff. Most of these creches charge considerably high fees for their service.\n\nThe demand for day-care facilities for children is expected to increase in view of:\n\n(a) greater job opportunities for women, arising from rapid industrialisation and economic expansion, and\n\n(b) the shortage of \"baby amahs\". With the trend towards smaller family units living in compact high-rise flats where other members of their extended family are not so readily available to render them any assistance, those families in which both the husband and wife have to be away from their homes to work elsewhere in the day will have to rely more and more on child-care services from outside the home. It is therefore likely that there will be a\n\nproliferation of private creches being established, particularly in private housing estates, to meet the needs and convenience of working couples.\n\nAlthough there are concrete plans to establish more Government creches, the policy is to encourage and help the private sector, especially the industrial organisations, to set up creches in their premises so as to reduce the high turnover in their female labour force and to induce more married women to take up employment in their factories. In fact, one leading industrial firm has already approached the Social Welfare Department for advice and assistance to set up a creche in its premises for children of its female employees.\n\nIn view of the expected increase in the number of private creches, there should be some means of controlling and supervising these creches. At present, there is no Government authority responsible for the licensing, control and supervision of private creches, nor is there any legislation on the matter. It is therefore essential that appropriate legislation be introduced as soon as possible, setting out appropriate standards for the establishment and operation of creches, to ensure that the interests of the children attending these creches are adequately safeguarded. It is also necessary to ensure that the public is not exploited by creche operators through the inadequacies or neglect on the part of the operators or through the collection of excessively high fees. On the other hand, laying down the standards and rules for establishment and operation of a creche will facilitate and help the private sector or any individual to plan and operate any proposed creche establishment.\n\nIn view of these reasons, my Ministry has proposed the enactment of this legislation. The views of concerned Government Departments, including the Ministries of Health, Education and Labour, the Public Works Department and the Singapore Fire Brigade, have been sought and incorporated in the Bill. All the authorities concerned have supported the proposal to introduce this Creche Establishments Bill and\n\nhave agreed to liaise on matters pertaining to their respective areas of work. Their suggestions and requirements have been given careful consideration and, as far as possible, included in the Bill.\n\nIt is intended that the Department of Social Welfare be the administrative authority for this legislation and its rules and regulations. Members will note that under the Bill a \"creche\" is defined as:\n\n\"any premises where children under the age of six years are received, whether for reward or not, to be looked after during the whole or part of the day or night but does not include nursing homes and maternity homes as defined in the Nursing Homes and Maternity Homes Registration Act and preschool institutions registered with the Ministry of Education\".\n\nA main provision in the Bill is to make it an offence for any person to operate a creche without a licence, thus disallowing any sub-standard and improper creches to be established. The Bill provides, inter alia, for the appointment of a Licensing Officer and Assistant Licensing Officers, the manner of the application for the licence, the duration of the licence and the inspection of creche premises. In addition, it empowers the Minister to make regulations to carry out the purposes and provisions of the Act.\n\nIn view of the increasing number of creches being established or to he established and to protect the interests of the young children who will be sent to such creches, there is a pressing need to enact this legislation in order to license, control and supervise establishment of creches on the one hand, and to provide some guidelines for creche operators to follow by, on the other.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n3.19 p.m.\n\nMr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have listened with interest to the commendable objectives of this Bill, now being read a Second time by the Parliamentary Secretary. I would like to ask him if he can inform the House as to how many Government\n\ncreches are being planned in the immediate or foreseeable future, especially in the densely populated housing estates, like Toa Payoh or Queenstown and even in the rural areas?\n\nMr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction of this Bill is very timely. Basically, this is another example of our Government's good measures in looking after our young citizens.\n\nAlthough the Social Welfare Department has already been running some creches for the care of children of working women, most of them are situated in the city areas. Children of working women living in the kampungs are therefore not being looked after.\n\nSir, in the process of rapid industrialisation, we need more and more creches because many factories need more female workers. Married women are therefore encouraged to come out of the kitchen to join the production team so as to take part in the industrialisation programme. This is not to encourage them to rebel against their husbands, but to enhance their social and economic position. Moreover, this will help to increase our national production and economic progress. Therefore, this is a wise measure on the part of the Government.\n\nBut most housewives are faced with the problem of caring for their children in their absence, and there is also the difficulty of getting \"baby amahs\". Similarly, many women who are occupied in other fields of work, including teachers, also need to put their children in creches so that they can devote more time to their work. Therefore, on the implementation of this Bill, I hope that the Minister will consider setting up more creches in more areas, particularly in industrial and private residential areas, including Jurong and Sembawang constituencies, because this will help housewives to join in the industrialisation programme, and to reduce the dependence on \"baby amahs\".\n\nMr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, what the Parliamentary Secretary had said just now, relating to the establishment of more creches, is very good. I give my whole support to this Bill. But on the one hand, he has said that he wants better facilities in these creches, and on the other hand he has said that the expenditure should not be too high. We cannot have both, of course. If we can achieve one objective, it is already good enough. So I hope that when the Bill is put into effect, the Government would not interfere with those private creches whose fees are high but they are able to provide better facilities.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: Mr Speaker, Sir, the need for the establishment of more creches to be run by the Government has arisen because not all industries can afford to run creches of their own. I welcome this Bill because the intention is to set up more creches.\n\nBut the complaints that are normally raised are that the creches close at a time when the mothers are still at work. Sir, even the newspapers' complaints mention that they close at 5.00 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. The solution to the problem during the course of drawing up the regulations for these creches is for the Ministry of Social Affairs to consider the possibility of extending their hours or of specifying various periods of service, so that working mothers who leave their children in the creche early may come to collect their children early. And those mothers who work in the afternoon can similarly call in the afternoon and collect their children late in the evening. If such arrangements can be made, it will certainly help a lot of working mothers. After all, the policy now is to encourage our women to work.\n\nDr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng): Mr Speaker, Sir, my question is one of clarification. Under the Bill, the definition of \"creche\" is \"any premises where children under the age of six years are received.\" Question is whether this definition includes kindergartens.\n\nIf it does, does it therefore mean that kindergartens run by private bodies, for example, the People's Association, or political parties, will henceforth need to be legislated?\n\nMr Chan Chee Seng(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, let me answer the question asked by the Member for Kim Keat regarding the number of creches that we have. I can say that we have 11 creches now. This year we are planning to build two more creches, one at Toa Payoh and the other at Kallang Basin. In other areas, for instance, Jurong Town, Katong, Queens-town, Woodlands, if there is a need, we will of course set up more creches. So if the Member for Sembawang has any need for more creches, he can put in his proposal to me.\n\nThe Member for Bras Basah mentioned about certain private creches charging, expensive fees. We can say that we are not exercising any control over these high charges, because it is a matter of supply and demand. So if parents want to send their children to such creches, it is their own business. If the charges of these private creches are too high, while the Government's creches charge too cheaply, perhaps these private creches will have to close down.\n\nThe Member for Telok Blangah has said that the opening hours of the creches are rather short, so that certain mothers find it inconvenient because when they go back to fetch their children the creches are already closed. Perhaps we can suggest a 24-hour service in which the staff work in shifts so that working mothers can fetch their children from these creches at all times.\n\nThe Member for Kim Seng asked whether the definition of \"creche\" includes kindergartens. This is a matter of age. The children are under six years of age, and it is run as a creche and not a kindergarten.\n\nDr Ong Leong Boon: Sir, my question is relevant, because in kindergartens, the children are under the age of six. The definition in this Bill is very\n\nwide, and therefore it seems that a kindergarten falls within the definition. Sir, my question therefore again is whether, in fact, this definition includes kindergartens.\n\nMr Chan Chee Seng: No, Mr Speaker, Sir.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to. `Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Chan Chee Seng].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. NATURE RESERVES (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.30 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, there are about 7,000 acres of land designated as \"Nature Reserves\" under the Nature Reserves Act. This Bill proposes to amend the Act so as to reorganise and to strengthen the Board of Management constituted under section 5 of the Act. The amendment provides for the Board of Management to consist of a trustee as Chairman to be appointed by the Minister and not less than six but not more than nine other trustees, two of whom shall be appointed by the President and the others by the Minister.\n\nA new section 5A, under clause 4 of the Bill, empowers the Board to appoint committees and to delegate its powers, functions and duties.\n\nClause 5 amends section 14 so as to enhance the penalty for offences committed under the Act, in order to deter trespassers from using these Reserves for illegal purposes; some like to fish, some like to camp, while others like to shoot animals or to cut down trees for\n\nfirewood. Such activities in these Reserves must be prevented.\n\nSir, I beg to move,\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr E. W. Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. GENEVA CONVENTIONS BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.35 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe Geneva Convention Bill is to give effect in Singapore to the four Conventions adopted at the Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries held in Geneva in 1949. It is the intention of the Singapore Government to accede to the four Conventions, the texts of which are set out in the Schedules to the Bill.\n\nTo-date, the Conventions have been acceded to by 132 countries. It is considered desirable that Singapore should now formally join in with those countries in upholding the fundamental objective of the Conventions, which is the observance of certain principles of human rights in situations of armed conflict.\n\nBroadly, the Conventions lay down basic humanitarian rules, which should be observed by all contracting parties, in all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the contracting parties, even if the state of war is not recognised by one of them. They also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a contracting party, even if such occupation meets with no armed resistance.\n\nThe first Convention deals with the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick of the armed forces in the field. The second Convention deals with the amelioration of the condition of wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea. The third Convention deals with the treatment of prisoners of war. The last Convention deals with the protection of civilian persons in time of war.\n\nThe Conventions specify that persons taking no active part in hostilities and those out of action due to illness, wounds, captivity or any other cause, should be humanely treated and protected against inhuman treatment, and that those who suffer should be given relief and care without distinction.\n\nThe Conventions also lay down certain minimum standards which contracting parties should also observe in the case of an armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one contracting party.\n\nHowever, the Conventions should in no way prevent a state from exercising its rights of sovereignty and punishing, on the basis of its own national law, any person guilty of undermining the security of the state.\n\nIn accordance with the obligations prescribed in the Conventions, this Bill makes it an offence punishable with life or up to 14 years' imprisonment for any person to commit any of the grave breaches set out in the Conventions. The Bill also contains procedural safeguards for the trial and defence of a protected prisoner of war, a protected internee or a person accused of grave breaches set out in the Conventions.\n\nWith the formal accession by Singapore to the four Conventions and the incorporation of the Singapore Red Cross Society by an Act of Parliament, the Singapore Red Cross Society will now be able to take its place in the League of Red Cross Societies at Geneva and participate with other national Red\n\nCross Societies in the affairs of the League.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Chua Sian Chin].\n\nBill considered in Committee. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\n3.42 p.m.\n\nClauses 1 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClause 5 -\n\nAmendment made:\n\nIn page 5, line 21, after \"and\", to insert \"at\". -[Mr Chua Sian Chin].\n\nClause 5, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClauses 6 to 12 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nFirst to Fourth Schedules inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nBill reported with an amendment; read a Third time and passed. SINGAPORE RED CROSS SOCIETY (INCORPORATION) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.44 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" The Singapore Red Cross (Incorporation) Bill when enacted will accord the Singapore Red Cross Society the status of the national Red Cross Society. This will enable it to take its place in the League of Red Cross Societies and be bounded by the International Committee of the Red Cross which administers the Geneva Conventions, on which I spoke a little while earlier.\n\nThe Red Cross is dedicated to the prevention and alleviation of human suffering in peace and in war. In peacetime it is concerned with disaster relief.\n\nIn addition to the Society's local activities in this respect it will, after the Bill is passed, be the national society which will participate in disaster relief operations which may be mounted internationally or regionally by the League of Red Cross Societies. In war-time it will be the agency for the protection of the wounded and sick of the parties in the conflict.\n\nOutside the periods of stress or national disasters, the Society also plays the role of medical auxiliaries to the public health and welfare authorities. Amongst the better known of its services are its ambulance service and assistance at accidents. It is hoped that its new role of a National Society will expand to other fields of activities which supplement the national medical services.\n\nThe Bill also reserves to the Society the right to use the Red Cross emblem or title and provides a penalty of $1,000 or six months' imprisonment or both, for the use of the emblem or title by any other person.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Chua Sian Chin].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. SECURITIES INDUSTRY BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.48 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nMembers will see from the Long title of the Bill and the Explanatory Statement that this Bill amends and consolidates the law with respect to the securities industry and repeals the Securities Industry Act, 1970 (No. 61\n\nof 1970) which was passed by Parliament on 30th December, 1970, but for reasons which will be given later on, was not brought into operation.\n\nIn my Second Reading speech at the time that that legislation was before Members, I dealt in considerable detail with the background to and the reasons for bringing in legislation to control the securities industry and trading in securities. This speech appears in the Hansard, Volume 30, cols. 461-7. I do not need to repeat at any great length what was said at that time for neither the reasons for, nor the background of, the proposed legislation have changed. The need, however, for such legislation being made operative has, if anything, become more pressing with the passing of time. We are continually being made aware from happenings in the market that investors need to be protected, so far as is possible to do so, by legislative intervention from unscrupulous manipulation and share rigging on the Stock Exchange. These are matters which stockbrokers with the best will in the world as a body are unable or not agreeable to control voluntarily. Needless to say, statutory provisions on these matters will not provide the universal panacea. The Government will still look to the Stock Exchange for its co-operation in exposing dishonesty and malpractices in share trading. In this and in other ways we anticipate that the Stock Exchange will justify the Government's policy in relying upon self-regulation on the Stock Exchange rather than imposing the strict forms of control implicit in a statutory body similar to the Securities Exchange Commission in the United States.\n\nIn my earlier speech to which I have referred, I reminded Members that Singapore and Malaysia enjoy a common Stock Exchange which over the years has existed to the undoubted economic benefit of both countries. I went on to say that Members would be reassured to learn that it was the intention of both Governments that this common Stock Exchange should continue in existence,\n\nand to enable this to be done it was essential that Singapore and Malaysia should have a uniform approach in legislation dealing with the securities industry and share trading. To this end, consultations have taken place between us and the Malaysian Government, and I am most pleased to record that these consultations have come to a happy and fruitful conclusion.\n\nMembers are aware that Malaysia introduced a Securities Industry Bill into their Parliament on the 22nd January, 1973. This Bill has been modelled on our earlier Securities Industry Act, but it also contains important additional provisions which were agreed to by the two Governments and which have been incorporated in the present consolidating measure.\n\nSince I last spoke to Members on this subject, I am glad to record that the Committee of the Exchange has implemented new rules to limit excessive speculation. Nevertheless, careful watch will need to be maintained to ensure that a resurgence of market euphoria does not carry speculation beyond reasonable bounds. If speculation becomes excessive, or if for other reasons the market becomes or is likely to become disorderly or unhealthy, appropriate corrective and remedial action will be called for.\n\nThe delay in bringing our earlier Securities Industry Act into operation was due to the desire to reach full agreement with the Malaysian Government on this uniform approach. As things have turned out, the delay has been fortuitous for it has given us an opportunity to propose further measures with regard to regulation of dealers in securities and share trading in the context of the existing booming share market. These, like the earlier provisions, are designed to protect the interest of investors to the extent that this is practicable.\n\nThe Malaysian Bill corresponds very closely with the Bill now before Members. We decided to introduce a consolidating measure on this subject rather than an amending Bill including the additional provisions I have mentioned\n\nsince it was considered important that references to Parts and sections in our legislation should, for the convenience of the financial public and the administrators of the legislation, correspond with the same Parts and sections in the Malaysian legislation. The new proposals that distinguish this Bill from the earlier Act are mainly concerned-\n\n(a) with the keeping of records by dealers, investment advisers and their representatives and employees of stockbrokers and financial journalists to show their interest in securities (Part V);\n\n(b) with the conduct of securities business (Part VI);\n\n(c) with the expansion of the provisions dealing with unlawful or dishonest forms of share trading (Part X).\n\nThe Explanatory Statement describes in sufficient detail what this Bill seeks to achieve and I need not deal with the provisions in any detail. However, I think it would be useful if I repeated what was said on the Second Reading of the earlier legislation with regard to the objects and scope of this proposed legislation.\n\nWhile the Bill covers the whole of the securities industry in Singapore, I would like to reiterate that the Bill does not attempt to prevent speculation as such. Some speculation attends every anticipation or expectation of short or long term price trends which induces trading activity on the Exchange. It is and always must remain the responsibility of the individual investor to decide as to the advisability of any particular investment. What the Bill actually does is to attempt to see that the stock market operates in a fair and open way and that people do not manipulate the market by illegal means for their own profit. The Bill, together with the new rules that have recently been passed by members of the Stock Exchange, will, it is considered, go a long way to achieve these objectives. However, I would like to emphasise again that the Bill does not merely pay lip-service to, but acknowledges, the principle of self-regulation of the Exchange by the Committee and is not intended to interfere\n\nwith the day-to-day control by the Committee of normal share trading on the Exchange, nor with the traditional form, of control that the Committee exercises over members of the Exchange except on such matters as the licensing of dealers in securities, the reduction to statutory form of existing Stock Exchange Rules with regard to the maintenance of brokers' trust funds and the fidelity fund, together with the keeping of records and the conduct of securities business to which I have referred.\n\nThe Bill, for the first time in Singapore, proposes to license dealers in securities and their representatives and investment advisers and their employees who are engaged in negotiating investment in securities. The Government believes that a system of control by licensing of dealers in securities is necessary at this time and this is particularly so as regards dealers in securities who are not stockbrokers. For while stockbrokers have always been subject to certain traditional forms of control by the stock exchange, other dealers have not been subject to any real form of control. The provisions in the Bill should ensure that only persons of good character and reputation and in a sound financial position will be permitted to be licensed as dealers in securities under the Act. Licensed dealers will be required to keep trust accounts and have them audited. This will not prove too burdensome to stockbrokers, for under Stock Exchange Rules they have been required to maintain trust accounts. Again, licensed dealers who are not stockbrokers will be required to enter into a fidelity bond. The reason for this is that the fidelity fund provisions in the Bill apply only to stockbrokers who are members of the Stock Exchange. With regard to the latter, they will find little that is unusual about those provisions, for under the existing Stock Exchange Rules a Fidelity Guarantee Fund was created to compensate persons who suffer loss by reason of the default of members. The provisions in the Bill therefore merely give statutory force to the\n\nestablishment of such a fund. The amount of capital in the existing fund will form the basis of the fund established under this Bill. The existing fund will be merged with the new fund established under this Act.\n\nAnother significant feature of the Bill is to be found in Part IX where new offences are created in relation to market dealings. The first offence relates to false trading and markets; the second offence to market rigging activities; the third offence to inducing the sale or purchase of securities by the dissemination of false information; the fourth offence which is drafted in the widest possible terms to deal with inter alia insider trading by officers of a company, their legal and financial advisers and even by any other person who may acquire confidential information. This provision together with the more specific provision in section 132A of the Companies Act should provide an adequate framework to proceed against insiders. The latter offence, like the other offences, carries a maximum penalty of $30,000 or five years' imprisonment or to both. It may not often be necessary for prosecutions to be launched under these sections, as in the United States similar provisions have been used with great effect to inhibit those wrongful practices which do so much to destroy a true market in securities. The Government believes, and I must repeat, that it is important that Parliament should clearly state its abhorrence of such practices, which already appear to have become widespread in the market, and that every effort should be and will be made to stamp them out.\n\nOn the subject of insider trading, I should also add that in a new Companies (Amendment) Bill the existing section l32A dealing with trading by officers of a company in their company shares will be considerably expanded and tightened up. Not only will power he sought to enable the Stock Exchange to conduct a full enquiry into these matters but also regulations will be made designed to restrict the dealings\n\nof officers of companies, members of their families, their legal and financial advisers, in the shares of their companies during certain periods of the financial year of the company when they are or are likely to be in possession of confidential information likely, if generally known, to affect the prices of their company's shares.\n\nFurthermore, the recently established Securities Industry Council will, amongst its other functions, be operating as a watchdog in market trading and, with the active co-operation oc the Committee of the Stock Exchange, it is anticipated that steps will be taken to punish and publicly expose those persons who indulge in insider trading.\n\nThe Malaysian Government's views on insider trading and other dishonest and unfair share trading practices coincide with the Singapore Government's views, and provisions on most, if not all, of these matters appear in the Malaysian Securities Industry Bill in much the same form as in the Bill now before Members. It is expected that further meetings with representatives of the Malaysian Government will shortly take place to discuss matters of common interest relating to the whole field of the securities industry and, inter alia, to decide what further measures should be taken to ensure that the stock market is maintained in a fair and healthy state. In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of Members to the wide powers conferred upon the Minister, in clause 95 of the Bill, to regulate the stock market. Some, if not all, of these regulatory powers appear in the Malaysian Bill.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n4.05 p.m.\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Mr Speaker, Sir, before I make my observation on the Securities Industry Bill, I would like to make a proposal concerning the requirement of investment advisers and stock and share journalists to declare their interests before they can comment on the stock and share market. My\n\nproposal is that all Members in this House who wish to make a speech today against this Bill should also declare their interests, otherwise it will give rise to suspicion. In this way we would be fair to the investment advisers and so on. In so far as I am concerned, I speak in support of the Bill. So whether or not I have got any shares is a matter inapplicable to my proposal.\n\nIt is my belief that whatever legislation is introduced by the Government, it is always done in the best interests of the people. That is the first consideration. Any proposed legislation that is at variance with the basic interests of the people will never get the support of the people. This means that it will be difficult for us to achieve our desired objective. The introduction of this Securities Industry Bill will, I believe, benefit the people in general, and the investors in stocks and shares in particular.\n\nThe introduction of this Bill is timely. As we all know, the present boom in our economy has attracted increasing foreign interest in the local market. Coupled with the success of industrialisation in recent years, this has attracted the massive inflow of foreign capital.\n\nOur Republic is regarded by foreign industrialists and investors as an ideal place for investment. It is against this background that our Stock Exchange has become so active and the market heated up. Current developments, however, have given rise to a misconception among some people that they can reap handsome profits just by dumping their money into the share market; just like a gold mine. Actually, an active and heated share market is not in itself an undesirable phenomenon, but the question is whether this sort of frenzy has been the work of speculators and manipulators and not the result of normal development.\n\nThe idea of getting easy money in this way, instead of through normal hard work, has attracted many people to try their luck at the Stock Exchange. If the situation is allowed to continue, unchecked, it will not only weaken the will\n\nand spirit of our people to work hard but it will also impede our industrial development. Take Hong Kong, for example. There, the share market is probably more active and more heated than that in Singapore. Professional people, and even domestic servants, have seen fit to abandon their regular jobs and take to share speculation. As a result, Hong Kong industrialists have expressed concern over the industrial future of the colony. This may well be a good lesson for us. In order to protect our people's interests and to encourthem to make bona fide investments, the introduction of this Bill is absolutely necessary.\n\nIn order to implement this piece of legislation in accordance with its true spirit, the co-operation and assistance of the responsible officials of the Stock Exchange and the sharebrokers will be necessary. They will play an important part in this respect. If these people were to go their own ways without regard for the true spirit of the Bill, they will do no good to themselves and to the people in general. On the other hand, if they are willing and ready to co-operate and assist in ensuring the smooth implementation of the provisions of the Bill, they will do a good service to the national economy and the interests of the people, including themselves.\n\nAs a global city and a prosperous society, Singapore cannot go without an active Stock Exchange in operation. The Stock Exchange provides the vital link in a prosperous and economic society. An economically prosperous country, without a share market in operation, will be just like a modern city without electrical currents. Therefore, while the activities of the share market should be strictly regulated, I believe it can be made even more active and booming through sound and proper administration, so that the people will be able to enjoy a more wholesome atmosphere of investment in stock and shares.\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill before the House is generally considered to be an enlightened piece of legislation on a very complicated subject. The Minister\n\nis to be congratulated for this. However, for the Bill to take effect on implementation, it seems to me that it will be necessary for the Ministry to provide a staff with sufficient knowledge of market operations to assist the Minister and the Registrar of Companies in fulfilling their functions. I should appreciate it if the Minister would inform the House as to what administrative arrangements are being made or will be made in this direction.\n\nThe market trends in recent months have very clearly shown that there is perhaps too much money chasing too few stocks. In view of this, I am wondering what steps are being taken to encourage more companies to go public, and whether the Minister would consider directing some of the Government-backed or Government-owned companies to go public. In this connection I have in mind companies such as Singapore Airlines, Sembawang Shipyard, and Jurong Shipyard. All these are capital intensive undertakings, with tremendous group potential. At the present juncture of their development, I should have thought that an injection of fresh capital from the public will help in their expansion programme.\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that there is really nothing but support from the House, I do not think there is very much for me to answer.\n\nLet me first take the enquiry of the Member for Jalan Kayu. He asked whether there were any arrangements made for an effective implementation of the Bill. I hasten to assure him that we will make all the necessary arrangements to ensure that staff will be adequate to deal with the very essential problems of administration. I believe the Registry of Companies will be moving into new premises in the newly erected building behind the City Hall, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore will also have in that same building some of their offices dealing especially with companies. I think the combination should be sufficient\n\nto allay any doubts or anxieties about our being serious in implementing the present legislation.\n\nAs to the question of more companies going public, I believe I have expressed my views on this matter, in asking as many companies as possible to go public. As far as Government-owned companies are concerned, I think a number of them will be examining the position after the end of the year. It is necessary in order to enable the companies to be floated to prepare the accounts so that public issue prospectuses can be prepared.\n\nI do not think the Member for Bras Basah requires any answer, but I am glad to note that he is for the Bill and it does not matter whether he owns any shares or not. I agree with him that an active Stock Exchange is very necessary for the development of Singapore.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\n\nBill considered in Committee.

[Mr. Hon Sui Sen].\n\nBrought up, and read the First time.\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Sir, I beg to move, \"That the clause be read a Second time.\"\n\nThe purposes of this amendment is to enable the Registrar, in deciding whether a dealer or his representative or an investment advisor or his representative is fit and proper person to hold a licence under the Act, to enquire whether that person has conducted his business in a fair and proper way and according to accepted business standards. In order to do this, it is considered that the Registrar should have the power to look into any transaction involving the purchase or sale of securities entered into by that person during any period of 12 months preceding the application for a licence or renewal of a licence. If, as a resultof this enquiry, he finds that a person\n\nhas in the course of his business used dishonest, unfair or unethical devices or trading practices, this would be a point of consideration for the Registrar to bear in mind in deciding whether that person was a fit and proper person to be licensed to carry on his business.\n\nIt can, of course, be argued that the inclusion of such a provision is not really necessary, since the Registrar would have an implied power or authority to do what the proposed provision enables him to do in any event. But the way a person has recently carried on his business must be a vital consideration in deciding whether he is a fit and proper person to be allowed to continue to carry on his business. And naturally, there are other considerations; for example, if a person has had a conviction for a criminal offence, or has been declared a bankrupt, he would not on the face of it be considered to he a fit and proper person to hold a licence under the Act. The provision is inserted to facilitate the making of enquiries by the Registrar in this matter and to avoid\n\nthe raising of doubts as to the exercise of his power.\n\nThe new provision is intended to cover an application for a licence, in the first instance, and an application for renewal of a licence. Licences will, under the Bill, be valid for a period of 12 months.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nClause read a Second time and added to the Bill\n\nThe Chairman: It is intended, that this new clause be inserted immediately after clause 16. Amendments are, therefore, required to be made to re-number the clauses, consequent on the addition of the new clause. These will be done.\n\nBill reported with amendments; read a Third time and passed.ADJOURNMENT: Resolved,\n\n\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"-[Mr Barker].\n\nAdjourned accordingly at Seventeen minutes to Five o'clock p.m.", "url": "https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/#/report?sittingdate=07-03-1973"}
