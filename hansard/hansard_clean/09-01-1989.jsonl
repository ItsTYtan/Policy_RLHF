You are the second Speaker in this Parliament who has no legal training. But as the experience of our former Speaker has shown, this lack of legal training should not hinder the Speaker in the exercise of his duties. Nor has it handicapped you in your responsibilities as Deputy Speaker.\n\nYour election to this high office today signifies the confidence we have in you in the last four years as Deputy Speaker. As Deputy Speaker since 1st March 1985, you have applied the Standing Orders fairly but firmly on all Members. You have shown that you are an impartial, decisive Deputy Speaker who brooks no nonsense from any Member of this House.\n\nI am sure all Members will give you our full support and cooperation in the exercise of your responsibility as Speaker of this august Chamber.\n\nSir, let me also pay tribute to your distinguished predecessor, Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng.\n\nDr Yeoh presided over proceedings in this House for 18 years, beginning on 27th\n\nJanuary 1970. He was elected and re-elected five times as Speaker of this Parliament. Although he did not intend to set a record when he first became Speaker, his tenure as Speaker will be a record that will be hard to be broken. He had been tolerant of Members who sometimes tested his patience. But he always ensured that order, decorum and fairness were observed in this House. During his tenure, he brought dignity and esteem to this high position of Speaker. All of us will remember Dr Yeoh for his long years of contribution. Although he is not present this afternoon, we would like to record our appreciation and gratitude for his distinguished service as Speaker of this House. [Applause.]\n\nSir, you will be presiding over an enlarged House of 81 elected Members. Eighteen of them are new. May I welcome them. For the first time in this Parliament, there will be one Non-Constituency Member (NCMP). He was in this Chamber 25 years ago. I am sure he is glad to be back. The presence of this honourable gentleman belies the myth in some quarters, some in his own Workers' Party that he represents, that the Non-Constituency MP is a second-class MP. We are glad that the Workers' Party has now accepted the NCMP scheme. We do welcome this honourable gentleman to this House and I hope that he will play a constructive role in this House. [Applause.]\n\nThe advice of Mr Barker, the once Leader of this House, still rings true. He said, \"No Member will stray from the straight and narrow path if he always lets conscience be his guide.\" This shall be the same advice I give to my colleagues. I would therefore urge all Members to make the best use of their time in Parliament, to speak their minds on issues which are of importance and concern to the nation and to the people.\n\nParliamentary debate is serious business. With television coverage, there is a danger that Members may play to the gallery. Members should resist from this temptation. Under the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act, Members are free to speak and debate in the proceedings of this House. But let me remind Members that they shall have to take responsibility for what they say. There\n\nhave been occasions in the Sixth Parliament when a Member was taken before the Committee of Privileges. I hope that there will be no need for the Committee of Privileges to meet in this Seventh Parliament.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir): Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will just allow me a moment also to convey my congratulations on your elevation to the Speakership. Sir, I think it would not be complete if it is just the Leader of the House conveying his congratulations to you. This is to make it complete. You have the approval of the whole House. I would also like to say a word of thanks to the previous Speaker who had a very good rapport with the Opposition. [Applause.]\n\nMr Speaker: I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for electing me Speaker of our Seventh Parliament. I would also like to thank the Leader of the House and the Member for Potong Pasir for their kind words about me.\n\nIt is indeed a rare privilege and an honour that you have bestowed on me. When I first entered Parliament in December 1976, and even over the years, I had not imagined that I would one day have the distinction of presiding over its proceedings. I was, however, all along conscious, and indeed even more so now, of the importance and responsibilities of this High Office. And I hope that during my term of office, I will be able to discharge my duties in a manner worthy of the confidence you have shown in me.\n\nWe are fortunate to have this newly-renovated Chamber to conduct our business. Our debates will no doubt be lively and intense. Much heat is likely to be generated, and not just because of the increased intensity of the television lights, but by the fact that this House has now got 82 members all raring to partake in the cut and thrust of Parliamentary debate. We can speak freely but let us remember that at all times we are honourable persons and we must never abuse the privileges accorded to us as Members of Parliament. We have a duty to ensure decorum and to uphold the honour and dignity of the House. We are bound by the Standing Orders, a set of rules that you may find at\n\ntimes complex and even cumbersome, but they are necessary so that the proceedings of the House can be conducted expeditiously and in a fair and orderly manner.\n\nI too would like to say a few words about my predecessor, Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng, who was Speaker of Parliament for 19 years. I understand he has served longer than any other elected-member Speaker of any Parliament in the world. [Applause.] Members were reminded earlier that I have had no legal training and during the past four years when I served as his Deputy, I found myself at times trying to unravel myself from some of the complexities of the rules of procedure. I found Dr Yeoh most willing to give me valuable advice and share with me the benefits of his long years of experience in the Chair. Members will no doubt want to join me in wishing him many happy years ahead in his well-deserved retirement. Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng sat in the Chair with esteem and honour. It is not an easy task to match him but with the help and support of honourable Members, I hope to maintain the high standards and traditions he set.\n\nLast but not least, I would like to welcome the new Members. As you adjust yourself to the intricacies of parliamentary life you might experience difficult moments. If I or the Clerk and staff of Parliament can be of assistance, do feel free to approach us. We look forward to listening to your maiden speeches, just as I am sure you look forward to delivering them. A bit of advice to you might be useful. If you ever wonder why at times it is difficult, as they say in Parliamentary parlance, to catch the Speaker's eye, just remember that long speeches are not necessarily good speeches.\n\nMR FRANCIS SEOW TIANG SIEW (Disqualification as Non-Constituency Member) (Announcement by Mr Speaker)\n\nMr Speaker: I wish to inform hon. Members that Mr Francis Seow Tiang Siew who was declared as having been elected as a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament on the 16th day of September 1988 has since the 17th day of December\n\n1988 ceased to be such a Member of Parliament.\n\nBy letters dated the 19th and 20th December 1988, the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts has informed me of the fact that Mr Francis Seow Tiang Siew was convicted and sentenced by a District Court for a total of five offences under section 96(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act.\n\nFor three of the offences for which he was convicted on the 17th December 1988, he was fined $3,000 for each offence and in respect of the two offences for which he was convicted on the 20th December 1988, he was fined $5,000 for each offence. The Attorney-General has advised that, on account of the fines imposed on him by the District Court on the 17th and 20th December 1988, Mr Francis Seow Tiang Siew has been disqualified to be a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament since the 17th day of December 1988, by reason of the provisions of Article 45(1)(e) of the Constitution.\n\nI have to therefore inform hon. Members that Mr Francis Seow Tiang Siew ceased to be a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament with effect from the 17th December 1988.\n\nSitting of Parliament (Motion)\n\nWith the consent of Mr Speaker and the general assent of Members present, Question put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat this sitting be suspended until 8.30 pm this evening. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\n\nMr Speaker: Order.\n\nSitting accordingly suspended at 3.40 pm until 8.30 pm.\n\nSitting resumed at 8.30 pm\n\nThe President (accompanied by two A.D.C.s) entered the Chamber, accompanied by Mr Speaker, who was preceded by the Serjeant at Arms (without the Mace), the First Assistant Clerk, the Principal Assistant Clerk and the Clerk.\n\nOn the Clerk announcing \"The President\", the President delivered his Opening Speech. PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS\n\nThe President (Mr Wee Kim Wee): Honourable Members:\n\nGoals and Challenges\n\nMy Government's goal is to create a better life for all Singaporeans. Every working Singaporean should have a skilled, well-paid job; every family should live in an affordable, comfortable home; and every child should be educated to the limits of his or her potential. Singaporeans should not only have their material needs met, but should also enjoy meaningful, fulfilling lives.\n\nWe can only reach these goals if we also meet the challenges ahead. We need to guard against external threats to our security. We need to maintain political stability at home. We need to overcome the constraints which limited land area, water supplies and population place on our economic growth.\n\nAll these Goals and Challenges are spelt out in the Agenda for Action, which Parliament has adopted (On 25th February 1988). They will continue to form the basis for nation building and Government policy.\n\nProgramme\n\nMy Government's programme for the next five years (See the Addenda to this Address (Cols. 21-44) contains specific targets to achieve this vision. The programme will build on what we have already accomplished.\n\nNow that there are enough school places for every child, we shall improve the education system further. We will upgrade our primary schools, convert more secondary schools to single-session schools, and pay greater attention to social studies, moral education and extra-curricular programmes.\n\nMore students are now doing well in schools, and qualifying for university. We shall expand university intakes, upgrade NTI into a full university, and study the\n\nfeasibility of building a new tertiary institution to complement NUS and NTI. We shall also allow Singaporeans to use part of their CPF savings for tertiary education.\n\nWith basic necessities taken care of, Singaporeans can now look to cultural and artistic pursuits. Then we may not only be knowledgeable and useful citizens, but also cultivated and well-balanced human beings.\n\nA National Ideology\n\nSingapore is wide open to external influences. Millions of foreign visitors pass through each year. Books, magazines, tapes, and television programmes pour into Singapore every day. Most are from the developed countries of the West. The overwhelming bulk is in English. Because of universal English education, a new generation of Singaporeans absorbs their contents immediately, without translation or filtering.\n\nThis openness has made us a cosmopolitan people, and put us in close touch with new ideas and technologies from abroad. But it has also exposed us to alien life-styles and values. Under this pressure, in less than a generation, attitudes and outlooks of Singaporeans, especially younger Singaporeans, have shifted. Traditional Asian ideas of morality, duty and society which have sustained and guided us in the past are giving way to a more Westernized, individualistic, and self-centred outlook on life.\n\nNot all foreign ideas and values are harmful. We cannot shut out the outside world, and turn inwards on ourselves. As Singapore develops, we must adapt our customs and traditions to suit new circumstances.\n\nHowever, the speed and extent of the changes to Singapore society is worrying. We cannot tell what dangers lie ahead, as we rapidly grow more Westernized.\n\nWhat sort of society will we become in another generation? What sort of people do we want our children to become? Do we really want to abandon our own cultures and national identity? Can we build a nation of Singaporeans, in South East Asia, on the basis of values and concepts native to other peoples, living in\n\nother environments? How we answer these questions will determine our future.\n\nIf we are not to lose our bearings, we should preserve the cultural heritage of each of our communities, and uphold certain common values which capture the essence of being a Singaporean. These core values include placing society above self, upholding the family as the basic building block of society, resolving major issues through consensus instead of contention, and stressing racial and religious tolerance and harmony.\n\nWe need to enshrine these fundamental ideas in a National Ideology. Such a formal statement will bond us together as Singaporeans, with our own distinct identity and destiny. We need to inculcate this National Ideology in all Singaporeans, especially the young. We will do so through moral education and by promoting the use of the mother tongue, by strengthening the teaching of values in schools, and through the mass media, especially the newspapers and television.\n\nPolitical Stability\n\nPolitical stability is the basis of our economic success. We must maintain it into the next century, with a new electorate and a new political leadership.\n\nBuilding Consensus. A clear national consensus on major issues has made Singapore a more stable society. The Government will continue to work towards a broad consensus. It will strive to bring together as many like-minded people as possible to work cohesively together for the country, whether or not their views coincide with the Government's on every issue. It will encourage those who support this consensus to identify themselves openly with the Government. Unless such persons speak up in support of policies which benefit all Singaporeans, the Government will find it difficult to carry these policies with the public.\n\nEncouraging Participation. Many Singaporeans took part in the National Agenda discussions. They helped to define the policies of the Government and the priorities of the whole nation. Following these discussions, the Government appointed six Advisory Councils: on Culture and the\n\nArts, Sports and Recreation, Family and Community Life, the Disabled, the Aged, and Youth. These Advisory Councils have made valuable and imaginative recommendations which the Government will follow up.\n\nThe Government will systematically create more opportunities for Singaporeans to participate actively in shaping their own future. It will appoint more Advisory Councils on specific subjects, so that knowledgeable citizens can produce new ideas to improve our lives. Parliamentary Committees will hold public hearings on major proposals, to collect views from the people, for example on the National Ideology. Town Councils will be formed, so that each town can run its own affairs as it judges fit, and do so more flexibly than any nation-wide bureaucracy.\n\nAccommodating Dissent. Singaporeans have shown that while they value good government, they also increasingly want alternative views to be expressed and dissenting voices to be heard. The Government will listen to alternative views and dissenting voices, and accommodate them where they are constructive. But national security and social cohesiveness must never be undermined.\n\nThe first step towards this accommodation was the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament scheme. With NCMPs, there will always be several opposition MPs in Parliament, whatever the outcome of the general elections. Such non-government MPs can question Government policies and argue for alternative courses of action. Provided they do so constructively, they can help the Government to reshape national policies, and help the public to understand issues more clearly. The Government will review the NCMP scheme and increase the number of non-government MPs to achieve this.\n\nThe Elected President. An Elected President with reserve powers will add a further important check and balance to our political system. The Government has accumulated large reserves and savings, which it holds in trust for the people of Singapore. If these assets are not protected, an unscrupulous government may\n\nuse them up quietly before anyone knows what has happened.\n\nWith an Elected President, the government of the day must first seek his agreement before spending any reserves which it did not itself earn. It must also obtain his agreement before making key appointments, for example Judges of the Supreme Court or Chairman of the Public Service Commission.\n\nSuch a safeguard will minimize the damage a dishonest, opportunistic or profligate government can do, and create a two-key system to protect our national reserves and the integrity of our public service. The Government intends to discuss this proposal fully before implementing the scheme.\n\nLower Income Groups\n\nEvery Singaporean should benefit from the nation's progress. Every one of us who contributes to society has a right to enjoy the fruits of growth. As Singapore has prospered, life has improved for all of us, rich and poor alike.\n\nStill, a few groups feel that relatively speaking, they have lagged behind the rest of society. While most Singaporeans have no difficulty keeping up with a changing world, some find it harder to adapt to a new environment.\n\nWe should not allow the less successful ones among us, who are unable to buy their own homes, or to provide adequately for their families, to feel left out. We should help this lower income group to upgrade their lives, especially those who are willing to make the effort to help themselves. The Government will do more to equip them with the skills to earn a better living, and to help them give their children a good family upbringing, a sound education, and a fair start in life.\n\nA Multi-racial Society\n\nSingapore is not a melting pot of different ethnic groups blending into one homogeneous population. It is a multi-racial nation, composed of distinct communities, each wishing to preserve its separate cultural identity. We will always have to be sensitive to ethnic factors in\n\nevery field of national life - whether in politics, housing, education or defence.\n\nGRCs. The Government created Group Representation Constituencies to prevent politics in Singapore from polarizing along racial lines. The results of the last General Election show clearly that the change was both necessary and workable. The danger of minority communities being under-represented in Parliament is a real one. We must continue to evolve our political system to accommodate the special requirements of our society.\n\nHousing. In housing, when the population moved out of the old Chinese villages and Malay kampongs, and resettled into HDB estates, the original racial groupings were broken up. Today the different communities live inter-mingled everywhere in Singapore. This improves relations among the races. It also ensures that every constituency contains a cross-section of Singaporeans, and every Member of Parliament understands the problems of a multi-racial society.\n\nHowever, as families upgrade and resell their HDB flats, blocks and neighbourhoods with concentrations of a single race are again starting to appear. We must arrest this unhealthy trend towards segregation, and manage the demographic composition of HDB estates so that every town and neighbourhood has a well integrated, balanced mix of races.\n\nUnequal Rates of Progress. Different communities making up a single society do not naturally progress at the same rate. This poses problems for the whole society. In Singapore, although the Malay community has made considerable progress, it still feels that its progress is not as good as the other communities.\n\nThe Government will encourage and facilitate the progress of Malay Singaporeans into the mainstream of national life. The Government must help all low income families regardless of race. However, it will provide special education and training opportunities for Malays. But such a policy can only yield results if Malay Singaporeans commit themselves to the endeavour, and resolve to make the hard choices and overcome the basic pro-\n\nblems themselves. No one else is able to do this for them.\n\nBy helping one community in this way, the Government is effectively discriminating in their favour and against the others. This is justifiable so long as it does not compromise the principle of meritocracy, and so long as the members of the community support these Government policies by openly identifying themselves with them.\n\nA Multi-religious Society\n\nReligious Tolerance and Moderation. Religious harmony is as important to us as racial harmony. Singapore is a secular state, and the supreme source of political authority is the Constitution. The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. However, in Singapore racial distinctions accentuate religious ones. Religious polarization will cause sectarian strife. We can only enjoy harmonious and easy racial relationships if we practise religious tolerance and moderation.\n\nReligion and Politics. Religious organizations have always done educational, social and charitable work. In doing so, they have contributed much to our society and nation. However, they must not stray beyond these bounds, for example by venturing into radical social action. Religion must be kept rigorously separate from politics.\n\nReligious groups must not get themselves involved in the political process. Conversely, no group can be allowed to exploit religious issues or manipulate religious organizations, whether to excite disaffection or to win political support. It does not matter if the purpose of these actions is to achieve religious ideals or to promote secular objectives. In a multi-religious society, if one group violates this taboo, others will follow suit, and the outcome will be militancy and conflict.\n\nWe will spell out these ground-rules clearly and unequivocally. All political and religious groups must understand these ground-rules, and abide by them scrupulously. If we violate them, even with the best intentions, our political stability will be imperilled.\n\nA Nation of Excellence\n\nCarrying out my Government's programme to improve the lives of Singaporeans, define a National Ideology, consolidate political stability, help the lower income groups, and strengthen multi-racial and multi-religious harmony are major undertakings involving all Singaporeans. After we carry them out, we will be another step closer to becoming a Nation of Excellence.\n\nAt the conclusion of the President's Address, Mr Speaker, preceded by the Serjeant at Arms, the Clerk, the Principal Assistant Clerk and the First Assistant Clerk, escorted the President (accompanied by two A.D.C.s) out of the Chamber, and the House adjourned without question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.\n\nAdjourned accordingly at Five Minutes to Nine o'clock pm.\n\nADDENDA TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF THE FIRST SESSION OF THE SEVENTH PARLIAMENT ON MONDAY, 9TH JANUARY, 1989 MINISTRY OF EDUCATION\n\nSince 1980 we have achieved significant progress in unifying and improving our education system. We have emphasized English as a key factor for Singapore's economic development and as a common working language in our multi-racial society. Today, all pupils learn English as a first language. As a result, our children are increasingly exposed to Western influences, particularly through the media.\n\nIt is important for young Singaporeans to be bilingual, and to learn their mother tongue as a second language, so that they will have a strong cultural foundation and not lose their Asian identity and values. The inculcation of core values must begin in the home. The values can be reinforced in the primary schools by ensuring adequate proficiency in the mother-tongue, and through appropriate lessons in the Social Studies, Moral Education and Extra-Curricular programmes.\n\nOver the next five years the Ministry of Education will upgrade the quality of education in our primary schools. We will enhance the professional status of primary school teachers, and upgrade facilities in primary schools, to give our children a good start in school. We will improve curricula, course structure and teaching materials for the mother-tongue, without overloading the child or lowering standards of English, Science and Mathematics, which are essential skills which children must acquire to earn a living in Singapore's modern economy. We will convert all secondary schools to single-session schools, introduce pastoral care and career guidance, and give schools more autonomy to tailor curricula and programmes to meet the needs of their pupils.\n\nAt the post-secondary level, we will build four centralized institutes to teach a wide range of commercial and academic subjects, and replace the present pre-university classes in our secondary schools. These institutes will complement\n\nthe junior colleges, VITB institutes and polytechnics. Together they will produce the trained manpower, particularly technicians and commercial staff, which the economy needs. They will also give every child the opportunity to be educated and trained in marketable skills up to the age of eighteen.\n\nAs our schools improve, more students will qualify for university admission. In order to create more university places, the Ministry will expand the teaching and research facilities of the National University of Singapore (NUS), and upgrade the Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) to a full university by July 1991. If the numbers justify it, we will also establish another tertiary institution to teach subjects such as music, speech, drama, dance and art. If not, we will link the institution to NUS or NTI and award their degrees and diplomas. DR TONY TAN KENG YAM Minister for Education\n\nMINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION: The Ministry of Communications and Information has three main missions:-\n\n(a) To promote the growth of the transport and communications industry;\n\n(b) To manage a safe and efficient domestic transportation system; and\n\n(c) To keep the public well-informed of Government policies.\n\nAir Transport\n\nWe will continue to attract more airlines to fly here by exchanging traffic rights liberally with other countries.\n\nThe second passenger terminal at Changi Airport will be ready in 1990. It will be able to handle 10 million more passengers per year, keeping Changi Airport as a major regional hub.\n\nSea Transport\n\nSingapore is the world's busiest port. We aim to become the world's best port, offering the widest range of maritime services. We will build a new container terminal on Pulau Brani, and an international passenger terminal at the World Trade Centre.\n\nTelecommunications\n\nIn 1989, we will launch an aeronautical telecommunications service. Passengers on board aircraft can then make telephone and data calls to the ground. By\n\n1991 Telecoms will replace coin-phones with cardphones which can make both local and international direct dialing (IDD) calls. By 1994 we will fully computerize our telephone network.\n\nWe have launched Teleview, an advanced photo-videotext system, and will now refine the system before offering the service to the public. We have just introduced the Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) to the business community, and will make it available nationwide in 1989.\n\nLand Transport\n\nWe will continue to regulate the growth in the car population and car usage, to keep our roads congestion-free.\n\nMRT construction has progressed smoothly. The first trains began running in November 1987, six months ahead of schedule. The system will be fully operational by 1990.\n\nWe will integrate bus services with the MRT to provide convenient access, minimize duplication, and maintain a high quality of service.\n\nInformation\n\nWe will help to keep Singaporeans well informed and knowledgeable, so that they can understand international developments, national issues and Government policies better, and play a role in nation-building.\n\nWe will improve our external public relations programme to strengthen friendly relations with other countries and investor confidence in Singapore.\n\nBroadcasting\n\nSBC will also cater more for the increasing number of young educated Singaporeans. It will improve its News and Current Affairs programmes, and broadcast more community-based news stories and interviews to clarify policies and stimulate discussion on current issues.\n\nSBC's local drama and variety productions will promote national values while entertaining. SBC will also produce more dramas in English which all communities can view and identify with. DR YEO NING HONG Minister for Communications and Information\n\nMINISTRY OF DEFENCE: Singapore's defence policy is peace through strength and readiness. Without a strong SAF, we have no basis for economic growth or prosperity, for preserving our own way of life, or for guaranteeing a long term future. MINDEF will ensure that the SAF always remains capable of defending Singapore.\n\nOur doctrine of Total Defence encompasses the entire population, and every aspect of defence: military, civil, economic, social and psychological. In the next five years, MINDEF will focus on raising operational efficiency, using technology for military purposes, coping wth smaller National Service intakes, and strengthening Total Defence.\n\nEfficiency and Readiness\n\nBecause defence is expensive, MINDEF must scrutinize closely every dollar spent. New equipment will cost more to operate. We will have to achieve savings without sacrificing military readiness or endangering soldiers' lives. The PRIDE movement - Productivity In Daily Effort - will be complemented by a sustained cost reduction programme.\n\nManpower Resources\n\nThe SAF is beginning to feel the effects of the low birth rates in the 60's and 70's. Fewer young men are now available each year for National Service than was the case in the 1970s. MINDEF will have to improve the training, deployment and use of regulars, reservists and full-time National Servicemen. We will have to be more conscious of productivity, use more civilians and SAF women in non-combat assignments, and contract out more jobs to the private sector.\n\nMINDEF will build a new SAFTI Military Institute for officer training. The new SAFTI will be a national institution, embodying excellence in the training of the SAF officer corps at all levels.\n\nTechnology\n\nThe SAF cannot expect to win in combat through sheer numbers. Instead, our troops must be well trained, well led, and well equipped, and must make full use of technology.\n\nTo save money, wherever possible instead of buying new equipment, we will refurbish and upgrade existing equipment to extend their service lives and improve their capabilities, as we are doing with AMX-13 tanks and A-4 Skyhawk aircraft.\n\nExploiting technology requires good engineers, scientists, technicians and mechanics. We will recruit more such people, upgrade their skills and knowledge, and build up the defence technology team.\n\nTotal Defence\n\nMany Singaporeans have taken part in civil defence exercises. We are also making progress in social and psychological defence, and in making the economy more adaptable and resistant to external pressures and shocks.\n\nWe have practised mobilising civil resources like heavy vehicles, vessels and aircraft. The public has responded with understanding and cooperation. The next step will be to conduct open mobilizations of civil resources, and to practise taking over essential establishments like hospitals and large vehicle workshops.\n\nRegional Security\n\nSingapore has a vital interest in a peaceful and stable Southeast Asia. We will contribute our part to regional security.\n\nOur defence relations with our ASEAN partners are based on mutual trust and respect. We will strengthen them through regular bilateral military exercises and frequent exchanges between the armed services.\n\nSingapore belongs to the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), together with Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The FPDA contributes to the peace and stability of the region. A key component of the FPDA is the Integrated Air Defence system (IADS). To strengthen FPDA, Singapore will assign a second fighter squadron to IADS. GOH CHOK TONG First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence\n\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Major political and economic changes are taking place on the international scene. Communist countries are going through a period of self-examination and change. East-West relations have never been more relaxed. There will be continuity in our foreign policy while we adjust to these changes.\n\nWe will continue to pay close attention to developments in neighbouring countries, and will work to strengthen institutional and personal links with our ASEAN partners, especially Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nRelations with ASEAN countries will continue to take high priority. We will work with them to implement the Programme of Action adopted at the Manila Summit in 1987. We will build upon and strengthen the existing ties of friendship and cooperation within ASEAN.\n\nThe thaw in East-West relations has improved prospects for settling regional problems and conflicts. We shall continue our diplomatic efforts to resolve the Cambodian problem. A just solution will lead to better political and economic\n\nrelations between Singapore and Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, Singapore will find more common interests with Japan and the Newly Industrialising Economies (NIEs). We are ready to take part in a dialogue between the OECD and the NIEs to achieve freer trade.\n\nThe Western powers will continue to have a major presence in South-East Asia. We shall maintain close relations with them, just as we should be friendly with any country which respects our independence and sovereignty, and our right to live and prosper in peace.\n\nAt the same time, the United States is anxious to share some of its global burdens and responsibilities. The question is how much of this defence and economic responsibility will devolve from the United States to Western Europe and Japan. Any adjustments, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, must be carried out smoothly to ensure world peace and security.\n\nThe huge Asian countries of China, India and the Soviet Union are becoming more important in Southeast Asia. We shall build on our existing relationship with them. Economic relations with China and India are already expanding. If conditions in the Asia-Pacific region are sound and stable, more areas of common interest with the Soviet Union can develop.\n\nSingapore will also build up ties with countries in South Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and the South Pacific. WONG KAN SENG Minister for Foreign Affairs\n\nMINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT: In land scarce Singapore, MND will ensure that we use land optimally for housing, economic development, infrastructure and community needs.\n\nHousing the People\n\nOver the next three years Town Councils will take over responsibility for estate\n\nmanagement from HDB in all constituencies. HDB residents will then have more influence over how their housing estates are managed.\n\nEach housing estate should reflect a cross section of the different social and economic groups of Singapore, in order to create a stronger sense of multi-racial community spirit and identity among Singaporeans. The HDB will therefore introduce measures to maintain a balanced ethnic composition of residents in its public housing estates. These measures will cover initial allocation as well as the resale market.\n\nUnder the building programme for 1986-90, the HDB will complete 121,000 flats. New flats will be better designed, with better internal finishes and workmanship.\n\nHDB will redevelop or retrofit older housing estates in phases to upgrade them to current housing standards. It will retain enough rental flats to provide for those who need transitional housing and the few who are unable to purchase their own flats.\n\nThe HDB will adjust its pricing system in order to allocate public housing more equitably. Flat prices will reflect variations in location, design, finishes, and desirability. The first premiums and discounts for locational differences were introduced in December 1987, and more will be introduced. The HDB will increasingly price and allocate its flats in accordance with market practices. Base prices will vary according to blocks and estates, with premiums and discounts for each flat where necessary. Purchasers will also have to commit to buy specific units when they register for HDB flats.\n\nPlanning and Developing a City of Excellence\n\nThe Ministry is reviewing the Singapore Concept Plan, a long-range land-use plan to guide the physical development of Singapore. The revised Concept Plan will promote orderly and coordinated development, safeguard land for major development needs, and provide the framework to develop a City of Excellence.\n\nThe Ministry will make the Planning System more open to the public, and will consult professionals in the private sector. It will prepare Development Guide Plans (DGPs) to provide timely information on proposed plans for specific localities. The first DGP Master Plan presented for public consultation was the plan for the Civic and Cultural District. By 1990, the DGPs for several other areas will be completed.\n\nThe Ministry will take the lead in conserving historic districts and buildings, to preserve our architectural heritage and keep Singapore a distinctive Asian city.\n\nRoads and Parks\n\nThe Ministry will introduce advanced traffic management and information systems to make the maximum use of our road system.\n\nWe will improve our streetscape and pedestrian walkways to make walking more pleasant, and encourage the public to make full use of the public transport systems.\n\nWe will continue to create a green and pleasant living environment. More colour, variety and fragrance will be added.\n\nConstruction\n\nWe will improve the efficiency competitiveness and quality of work of the construction industry, and continue to promote the export of construction services vigorously.\n\nWe will introduce new building control standards to make buildings structurally safer.\n\nPrimary Production\n\nWe will maximise the productivity of our limited agricultural land by developing agrotechnology parks. Pig farming will be completely phased out by 1990.\n\nWe will upgrade veterinary public health procedures to ensure that all imported fresh foods are safe. S DHANABALAN Minister for National Development\n\nMINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS: Law and order and internal security are essential for stability and economic growth. The Minisry of Home Affairs will ensure that Singapore remains a safe and secure place for all.\n\nLaw and Order\n\nThe public and Police are cooperating much more closely in law enforcement and crime prevention. The Police have streamlined their organization and procedures as recommended by management consultants. The Neighbourhood Police Post programme will be completed by the end of 1989.\n\nWith this community structure in place, the Police will focus on improving the quality of their training and their specialist capabilities. They will acquire modern equipment to carry out its missions, including up-to-date vehicles and vessels for land and coastal policing, riot-control equipment, and forensic equipment. To complement this, the Police Academy will upgrade its facilities and introduce new courses.\n\nInternal Security\n\nThe arrests of the Marxist conspirators in 1987 and the re-arrests of some of them in 1988 indicate that the Communist threat has emerged in a new form. As a small country, Singapore is vulnerable to attempts by foreign powers to interfere in our internal affairs. Racial and religious extremism and international terrorism can still endanger our internal security. ISD will continue to monitor and counter them vigilantly.\n\nDrug Enforcement\n\nAlthough drug and inhalant abuse is under control in Singapore, the inflow of drugs is still a problem. We will tighten detection measures at entry points. The Central Narcotics Bureau will also monitor worldwide trends in drug abuse, to prevent new drugs like cocaine from catching on in Singapore.\n\nRehabilitation\n\nWe will build two new prisons and a new drug rehabilitation centre to ease overcrowding and facilitate rehabilitation. We will also improve aftercare and rehabilitation programmes to reduce recidivism.\n\nImmigration Control and Identification\n\nThe Immigration Department will continue to take vigorous action against overstayers, illegal immigrants and those who harbour them. At the same time, we will make it easier for foreign entrepreneurs, professionals and skilled workers to enter and settle in Singapore, in order to add to our pool of talent.\n\nWe will introduce a new tamper-proof credit-card sized identity card.\n\nCivil Defence\n\nThe Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) will build up its reservist manpower, and set up more training areas and schools to meet increased training needs.\n\nWe will continue to train more Civil Defence volunteers, and involve the public in more Civil Defence exercises, for example, to test out emergency distribution and control of food, water and fuel, in order to educate Singaporeans to respond quickly and effectively in emergencies.\n\nThe SCDF will install a Public Warning system, and a comprehensive command, control and communications system for its units.\n\nFire Service\n\nWe will build more fire stations to speed up response to fires and emergency incidents.\n\nWe will revise the Fire Code, emphasize fire prevention, and encourage professionals and building owners to be more conscious of fire safety.\n\nThe Singapore Fire Service and the SCDF will complement each other by integrating common areas of work, and by\n\nestablishing a common training school for both organizations. PROF. S JAYAKUMAR Minister for Home Affairs\n\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE: The Government's financial policies will continue to promote economic growth.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nOur tax structure must remain fair and broad-based, and must adequately reward effort and enterprise. As tax practices evolve in other countries, we will revise our tax system to keep the fiscal climate competitive and hospitable to investors.\n\nWe will continue to carry out public sector development projects, including expenditures on research and development. We must invest for the future, and build up the nation's stock of capital.\n\nOur policy is to maintain a balanced budget over the long term. Each generation should pay its own way, and not burden future generations with debts.\n\nPublic Sector Efficiency\n\nWe must not allow the public sector to consume an increasing share of national resources as the economy grows. Recurrent public sector expenditure must not grow faster than the GDP. The Government is the country's largest workforce. Ministries and statutory boards must constantly improve their productivity and efficiency. Waste must be abolished.\n\nA management accounting system covering all Ministries will help managers to monitor the true costs of their operations, track performance against targets, and improve cost-effectiveness. The new block vote budget allocation and control system will help Ministries to operate more flexibly and effectively. Ministry of Finance will now have an objective basis for allocating funds and manpower, and Ministries will have full autonomy to manage their resources within approved budgets.\n\nThe Management Services Department and the National Computer Board will\n\ncontinue to assist Ministries to streamline organizations and procedures, and automate and computerize their operations.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nWe will continue to operate an open financial system, free of capital and exchange constraints. Monetary policy will primarily target for non-inflationary economic growth.\n\nFinance and Banking\n\nThe supervisory authorities will oversee the financial institutions in Singapore closely but not rigidly. The financial community should operate with a minimum of regulatory control, yet maintain prudential standards to protect the integrity of the financial system and the interests of the public.\n\nWe will continue to develop Singapore as an international financial centre, based on a growing network of financial institutions providing diverse services in lending, capital markets, fund and risk management.\n\nPrivatization\n\nThe Government will continue to withdraw from mature sectors of the economy. However, we will still invest in and provide seed money for the development of new industries, both alone and in partnership with the private sector, at home and abroad.\n\nWherever possible, Ministries will contract out services which the private sector can provide more efficiently. This should encourage private sector initiative and entrepreneurship.\n\nThe Civil Service\n\nTo implement Government policies and programmes effectively, we need able and dedicated officers at all levels of the public service. Public servants will be trained and upgraded in order to serve the public better.\n\nTo attract and retain able officers, public sector remuneration and conditions of service must be competitive with the pri-\n\nvate sector. The flexible wage system already introduced will link public sector wages to national economic performance. The next step in public sector wage reform will be to revise salary and career structures to keep up with new conditions in the labour market. DR RICHARD HU TSU TAU Minister for Finance\n\nMINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Growth Target\n\nWe aim for an annual GDP growth rate of 6% over the next five years. This is a growth rate which we can sustain, at this stage of our economic development, given our limited resources, particularly labour.\n\nHowever, even 6% will not be easy to achieve. Much will depend on the availability of export markets. A global recession, or even a slowdown in the economies of our neighbours and OECD countries, must affect Singapore. But whatever the external environment, sound economic policies can mitigate its effects and maximize our chances of achieving our economic objectives.\n\nMulti-National Corporations\n\nMulti-national corporations have been a key factor in upgrading and restructuring our economy. They offer good jobs for Singaporeans, link us into the international economy, and provide us access to capital, technologies and markets. Foreign investments will remain indispensable for our growth. To attract MNCs, we will promote Singapore as a key node in their global operations.\n\nLocal Businesses\n\nAt the same time, local businesses also have an important role. Many of the larger companies have prospered in the last two decades. They have shown how indigenous entrepreneurship can germinate and grow in our business environment.\n\nAs our economy develops, there will be fresh opportunities for forward-looking, local small and medium enterprises. Many SMEs have struck out on their own,\n\ncreating new businesses for domestic and export markets. Other SMEs can service MNCs, which require reliable and competent supporting industries to supply them with parts and components. The Government will help SMEs grow and find their rightful place in the Singapore economy.\n\nMoving Offshore\n\nOffshore activities are a natural extension of our domestic economy. Our future depends not only on what we can produce domestically for export, but also on what we can earn from abroad. We cannot confine ourselves to business opportunities in Singapore.\n\nWe encourage MNCs and local companies in Singapore to distribute their business activities among different countries in the region, in order to benefit from the comparative advantages of each country. EDB has started an International Direct Investment Programme to help them do so. We offer fiscal and other incentives to assist local companies venture overseas.\n\nTraining\n\nOur economic strategy hinges on one key resource - people. We need to do more in manpower development and post-employment training. The Skills Development Fund will support training in both existing and emerging skills. In 1990, the National Productivity Board will start using television to broadcast programmes for worker training. Training Television will help more workers to acquire skills useful in their careers.\n\nInfrastructure Development\n\nWe will upgrade our utilities, ports, airport, and telecommunications, to stay efficient and competitive. Over the next five years:\n\n(a) The PUB will spend $3.6 billion on utilities projects, including a new power station on Pulau Seraya, and a new dam and reservoir at Sungei Linggiu in Johore.\n\n(b) JTC will upgrade Jurong Port to handle bulk cargo more efficiently, and build a business park in Jurong East, to\n\nmeet the specific needs of modern business and high technology industries.\n\n(c) SISIR will set up an Electronics Test Centre to support local electronics industries in testing and evaluating parts and components, and a Food Technology Centre to help the food industry with innovation, processing, and product packaging.\n\n(d) TDB's TradeNet Project will streamline trade documentation procedures when it comes into operation in 1989. TDB will also set up a Design Centre to improve design standards and help market Singapore products internationally.\n\n(e) Tourism projects will include conservation and revitalization of historical districts and buildings, redevelopment of Fort Canning Park, construction of a causeway to Sentosa, construction of a resort on Lazarus Island, and development of a theme park at Marina South. BG LEE HSIEN LOONG Minister for Trade and Industry\n\nMINISTRY OF LABOUR: We shall continue to promote harmonious industrial relations and a safe and healthy working environment.\n\nIndustrial Relations and Wage Reform\n\nThe experience of an economic recession and two years of wage restraint has strengthened the partnership between management and unions, and improved prospects for investment, employment and economic growth.\n\nBoth management and unions have accepted the need for flexible wage systems linked to productivity and profitability. We will encourage more firms to adopt flexible wage systems.\n\nUse of Manpower\n\nWith full employment, employers must upgrade and mechanize further to improve productivity. The Government will continue to regulate recruitment of unskilled foreign workers, so that Singapore will not become over-dependent on them.\n\nWe will raise the retirement age to 60 within the next three years, and encourage part-time employment. If necessary, we will amend the Employment Act to do so.\n\nSocial Security\n\nThe CPF scheme already provides for the old age, housing and hospitalization needs of Singaporeans. With the Minimum Sum Scheme in place, we will keep the CPF withdrawal age at 55 even after raising the retirement age to 60.\n\nWe will extend the CPF scheme to more self-employed working Singaporeans.\n\nAs the economy grows, we will raise the CPF contribution rate in step, to reach the long-term target of 40%, split equally between employers and employees.\n\nWe will allow Singaporeans to invest part of their CPF savings in tertiary education for themselves and their children, up to the limit of the fees set by NUS and NTI. After the students have graduated and started working, they must pay back to CPF the funds they have used, so that the basic objectives of the CPF scheme are not undermined, and their parents' needs are not neglected.\n\nWe will review Workmen's Compensation rates.\n\nIndustrial Safety and Health\n\nThere are now fewer factory accidents. We will continue to encourage self-regulation in industrial safety and health, and step up safety and health education programmes together with employers and unions. LEE YOCK SUAN Minister for Labour\n\nMINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT: A clean environment is essential to a high quality of life. The Ministry will continue to protect and improve the environment. It will build more public health and environmental infrastructure such as sewerage, drainage and solid waste disposal facilities.\n\nMore than 96% of the population have modern sanitation. The Ministry will extend sewers to the remaining premises, and expand sewage treatment capacity to meet the needs of a growing population.\n\nWe will undertake more drainage projects as new areas are developed. The Bukit Timah Flood Alleviation Phase IIA Project will be completed in 1990. Our rivers and waterways will be kept clean.\n\nA third incineration plant at Senoko will be completed in 1992.\n\nTo prevent illegal dumping, the Ministry will license private waste collectors to collect and dispose of solid wastes.\n\nWith all street hawkers completely resited, the Ministry is reviewing its plans for markets and food centres. It will privatize management of these facilities gradually, and raise the standard of hygiene and cleanliness in all food outlets.\n\nThe Ministry will work with the Registry of Vehicles for better control of emission from vehicles, in particular black smoke from diesel vehicles.\n\nWe will educate Singaporeans in their social responsibilities for public health and the environment. DR AHMAD MATTAR Minister for the Environment\n\nMINISTRY OF LAW: The new Copyright Act came into operation in 1987. However, this is still based on traditional copyright principles, and does not deal with the peculiarities of semiconductor chips and chip manufacturing technology. We will draft a new law to provide an explicit remedy for the misappropriation and unauthorized copying of the circuit layout of a semiconductor chip.\n\nWe will review the existing trade mark and patent systems to speed up the processing of applications. We will revise the laws to take account of changes in commercial practice, and to allow indigenous registration of patents in Singapore. This will make the legal environment more conducive to creativity and innovation,\n\nand help us to develop into a centre of high technology.\n\nThe Law Revision Committee published the Revised Edition of the Statutes of the Republic of Singapore in 1987. Its next task is to prepare a Revised Edition of the Subsidiary Legislation of Singapore. After this is done, such legislation will become easily accessible to the public and lawyers for the first time.\n\nThe Attorney-General's Chambers will install a computerized system to store and retrieve legal opinions and precedents and up-to-date information on statutes and subsidiary legislation.\n\nThe computerization of land management operations, including the processing of property transactions and plan and map drawing, is progressing smoothly. Databases on landed property dealings and land surveys and mapping are being created and will progressively be placed on-line for public use. PROF. S JAYAKUMAR Minister for Law\n\nMINISTRY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT: Having satisfied our basic material needs, we can look forward to a better quality of life. MCD will concentrate on promoting family and community cohesion, enriching our cultural life, and improving community facilities and services.\n\nHelping Families to Help Themselves\n\nThe Government will work with voluntary welfare organizations to help the elderly, the distressed and the disadvantaged to be as economically and socially independent as possible.\n\nOur senior citizens programmes will focus on keeping senior citizens physically, socially and mentally active. We need more community-based services for the aged, so that they can stay with their families for as long as possible.\n\nWe will inculcate in Singaporeans a caring and sharing attitude towards the less fortunate amongst us. Working with voluntary welfare organizations, we will help the needy to look after themselves and become more self-reliant.\n\nWe will encourage voluntary welfare groups to play a greater role in providing welfare services to the needy, and set up pilot Family Service Centres to render community-based support services to families needing assistance.\n\nWe will encourage more private organizations to set up child-care centres in housing estates and work places so that mothers can continue working. We will also train more child-care staff so that high standards are maintained.\n\nPromoting a Community Spirit\n\nCitizens' Consultative Committees, Residents' Committees and other grassroots organizations will organize more and family-based community activities to promote family life and strengthen family ties, and hold more discussions and joint activities to reach out to residents of private estates and condominiums.\n\nWe will continue to promote social cohesiveness in our multi-racial, multi-religious society. Our community relations programme will encourage people to interact with one another and build closer ties. Now that more Singaporeans of all races are taking part in community activities, we will encourage even more, especially from the minority communities, to come forward and join them.\n\nThe Feedback Unit will continue to involve Singaporeans in building a consensus on issues which affect our lives. It will use Teleview to be a more effective and responsible channel for dialogue between the Government and the people.\n\nEnriching Our Cultural Life\n\nOver the next five years, we will promote a wider range of cultural activities. There will be more Singaporean items. The biennial Arts Festival will become an annual event in the 1990s.\n\nEvery Singaporean will have the opportunity to enjoy the arts. We will create more opportunities for cultural organizations and artistes to excel in the arts, and make cultural events more accessible to the public. We will commission more creative works to foster the development of a Singapore repertory, and display more art works in parks and buildings.\n\nRaising The Quality of Facilities And Services\n\nWe will build an Arts Complex, and remodel three historical buildings to house a Fine Arts Museum, a Children's Museum and a History of Singapore Museum. We will also build a modern National Library and four new branch libraries in Yishun, Tampines, Hougang and Woodlands.\n\nOver the next five years, we will continue to promote sports for all, and provide enough facilities for our people. These include the Indoor Stadium, four swimming complexes, seven stadia and one sports hall. Talented sportsmen will have opportunities to excel and to realise their potential.\n\nThe People's Association will phase out the smaller and older community centres and build more modern centres in housing estates to cater to the social and recreational needs of residents.\n\nAdvisory Councils\n\nThe Government has set up six Advisory Councils to draw up social and community programmes. They cover:-\n\n- Culture and the Arts\n\n- Sports and Recreation\n\n- The Disabled\n\n- The Aged\n\n- Family and Community Life\n\n- Youth Their reports will guide our social and community development for the next decade.\n\nMalay/Muslim Matters\n\nThe Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) will improve the management of\n\npilgrimage matters, coordinate and regulate Islamic educational institutions, and contribute to the poor and needy. Over the next five years, five more mosques will be built.\n\nThe Government, working with Malay/Muslim organizations, will continue with its efforts to help the Malay/Muslim community improve their educational, economic, and socio-cultural achievements. However, Government support, though important, is not the fundamental factor. Malay/Muslim community support, commitment and determination are. Without these, progress will be minimal. WONG KAN SENG Minister for Community Development\n\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH: The Ministry of Health aims to build a healthy nation and to achieve a high standard of health care for all Singaporeans. We will do so by preventing disease and educating the public. We will also upgrade primary health and hospital services to develop Singapore into a centre of medical excellence.\n\nWe will promote healthy habits and lifestyles, and expand screening and counselling services to prevent hereditary diseases and detect major illnesses like cancer and heart disease.\n\nWe will upgrade the school health and dental programme, and immunize children against childhood diseases and hepatitis.\n\nWe will train more medical, nursing and ancillary staff in Geriatric Medicine, and work closely with the Home Nursing Foundation to provide a home nursing service for the elderly and chronic sick.\n\nOver the next five years, we will phase out old and inefficient outpatient clinics, and replace them with eight new polyclinics in major HDB new towns.\n\nWe will build the first community hospital at Ang Mo Kio new town, to cater for elderly patients and others who have simple illness not needing the expensive and sophisticated treatment offered by acute general hospitals.\n\nWe will redevelop four major hospitals - Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Toa Payoh Hospital, Kandang Kerbau Hospital and Woodbridge Hospital.\n\nWe will set up specialty centres to treat children's diseases and cancer, eye and heart disease.\n\nWe will restructure the acute hospitals, beginning with the Singapore General Hospital in early 1989, to improve service to the pubic.\n\nWe will establish selected new medical and dental specialities to meet the needs of the population. We will encourage medical research and development, and increase training and exchange programmes with internationally established medical centres.\n\nWe will review the career schemes of nursing, rehabilitation and other ancillary services and encourage school leavers to take up these careers so that we will have enough of these professionals.\n\nWe will monitor the use of Medisave closely to limit abuse, and introduce a Catastrophic Illness Insurance Scheme to protect participants against heavy medical expenses arising from major and prolonged illnesses.\n\nWe will implement and coordinate the new population policies and the Family Life Education Programme, to solve the problem of the better qualified women remaining unmarried, and to encourage Singaporeans who can afford it to have more children.
