Jeyaretnam & Co. dated the 27th November 1986 written on behalf of Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam in which they had expressed his intention to attend the sitting of Parliament on the 9th December 1986 and had requested me to make arrangements to enable him to do so.\n\nI have sought the advice of the Attorney-General on the matter and he has given me an Opinion which reads as follows:-\n\n'I have been asked by Mr Speaker for my opinion on the effect of the dismissal of Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam's appeal against his conviction and sentence particularly in respect of the said appeal as regards his status as a Member of Parliament.\n\nHaving previously heard arguments in respect of the said appeal from both the appellant's lawyers and the Deputy Public Prosecutor, the High Court on 10th November 1986 made the following orders:-\n\n(a) the appeal against conviction be dismissed;\n\n(b) the sentence imposed by the Senior District Judge be varied to:-\n\n(i) an imprisonment for a term of one month; and\n\n(ii) a fine of $5,000 in default of which the appellant will have to serve a further term of one month's imprisonment; and\n\n(c) bail extended till 11th November 1986 pending the hearing of the Criminal Motion No. 59 of 1986.\n\nOn 11th November 1986 Criminal Motion No. 59 of 1986 was heard and dismissed by the High Court.\n\nIn view of the fine of $5,000 imposed on him by the High Court on 10th November 1986, Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam became subject to disqualification from membership of Parliament (vide Article 45(1)(e) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore). As the Order of Court refers to this imposition of fine being made on the 10th day of November 1986, and as the Order was also dated the 10th day of November 1986, his disqualification took effect from that date.'\n\nI have to therefore inform hon. Members that Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam ceased to be a Member of Parliament with effect from the 10th November 1986.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir): Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just make a comment on what you have just read?\n\nMr Speaker: No. It is not usual for Members to make comments on my Statement. You ask your first Question for Oral Answer, Mr Chiam.\n\nORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ANSON BYE-ELECTION\n\n1. Mr Chiam See Tong asked the Prime Minister whether and when a Writ of Election in respect of the Anson Constituency will be issued; and, if not, what are the reasons for not holding a bye-election at Anson.\n\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Dhanabalan) (for the Prime Minister): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has asked me to answer this question. The Government has not decided on a bye-election in Anson. There is no obligation under the law to hold a bye-election within a specific time.\n\nThe Government will take a decision in the latter half of next year. We shall inform the Member for Potong Pasir.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Mr Speaker, Sir, the only reason I can say is that, according to the Minister, there is no necessity under the law to hold a bye-election. But I beg to differ with him. There is a necessity to hold a bye-election.\n\nMr Speaker: Mr Chiam, could you please ask your supplementary question? You are making a speech.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: All right, I will ask my supplementary question. Although the law does not say within a time frame in which a bye-election should be held, does not the Minister interpret the law that it must be held within a reasonable time, say, three months from 10th November, 1986?\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not the first time we have debated the question of whether there should be a bye-election. In 1983 when the late Mr Hon Sui Sen passed away and his seat in Havelock fell vacant we had a fairly lengthy debate in this House. There is nothing in the law that even requires a bye-election to be held. I am speaking on the basis of an Opinion from the Attorney-General. If the Member for Potong Pasir feels very strongly that the law requires that we hold a bye-election within a reasonable time, which he puts as \"three months\", I think he is aware of the legal recourses that he has to force the Government to have a bye-election.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: This is typical of the Government - \"Go to the Courts\". We have heard that before. Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1983 at Havelock there were valid reasons. That constituency was to be taken away and the Prime Minister had said that the General Elections was going to be early. Now, let us have the reasons this time, Mr Minister. If there are no valid reasons then a bye-election should be held. Let us have the valid reasons, please, like in Havelock.\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I have made it very clear that we are under no obligation to have a bye-election. There is no requirement under the law. There never was a requirement. It is entirely up to the Government to choose the time that it feels is appropriate to have a bye-election, and we are not obliged to give any reasons.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask the Minister: Is he afraid of losing the bye-election? Let us have the truth. Are you afraid that Hong Lim 1961 will be repeated all over again?\n\nAn hon. Member: Are you afraid of being lonely in the House?\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Don't be funny.\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Potong Pasir must know that whatever happens in any bye -election in Anson will not in the slightest way affect the performance of this Government because we have such an overwhelming majority here. So that is certainly not the consideration. I take it, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Member for Potong Pasir is so anxious to have a bye-election in Anson because his Party will contest the bye-election.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Mr Speaker, I am not anxious. We here are not concerned about me. We are concerned about the nation. We have been talking of nation building. We have been talking of democracy. We have been talking of the right of representation. Do not all these things mean anything to the Minister at all?\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I have nothing more to add. The people of Anson elected Mr Jeyaretnam. He has been convicted of a criminal offence and fined and sent to jail. They have to learn to live with the consequences of their choice.\n\nCOPYRIGHT BILL (Date of enactment)\n\n2. Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam asked the Minister for Law whether he expects the Copyright Bill to become law before the end of 1986.\n\nThe Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar) (for the Minister for Law): Mr Speaker, Sir, it was the Government's intention that the Copyright Bill should be enacted as law before the end of 1986. This intention was publicly announced both in Singapore and abroad. An undertaking to this effect had also been given to the United States Government when the Prime Minister met the US Secretary of State Mr George Shultz in Singapore in June this year.\n\nHowever, for several reasons, the Select Committee has taken longer than expected to complete its work. First, it received 34 written representations, which I am told, is the largest number that any Select Com-\n\nmittee has received in our Parliament's history. These were from a wide range of organizations and individuals in Singapore and abroad representing copyright owners and users of copyright materials, and included representations from the United States Government and United Kingdom Government. Fourteen representors comprising a cross-section of the representations were invited for oral representation before the Select Committee. They included representatives of both local interests and American and British interests.\n\nSecondly, Sir, the representations proposed major amendments to the Bill. In view of the complexity of the Bill, the Select Committee needed time to make a careful study of both the legal and policy implications of these proposals. Furthermore, the Select Committee had also to arrange its meetings to accommodate the requests of representatives coming from abroad.\n\nI am glad to say that the Select Committee has now completed hearings of all the representors who were invited. It will finalize its work on December 15th and its report to Parliament should therefore be ready shortly thereafter. The Bill should therefore be enacted as law in January 1987.\n\nVACANT LOT NEXT TO DARUL AMAN MOSQUE (Development plans)\n\n3. Encik Wan Hussin bin Hj Zoohri asked the Minister for National Development what are the development plans for the vacant lot adjacent to Darul Aman Mosque bounded by Sims Avenue and Jalan Eunos.\n\nThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Lee Yiok Seng) (for the Minister for National Development): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am replying on behalf of my Minister.\n\nThe site bounded by Sims Avenue and Jalan Eunos is adjacent to the Eunos MRT Station and is reserved for future development.\n\nEncik Wan Hussin bin Haji Zoohri (Kampong Ubi): Sir, would the Senior Parliamentary Secretary elaborate what this future development is?\n\nMr Lee Yiok Seng: Sir, since the site is near the MRT station, it is mainly for commercial development.\n\nHDB FLAT-PURCHASERS (Refund of excess payments)\n\n4. Mr Chiam See Tong asked the Minister for National Development whether all the refunds have been made to Housing and Development Board flat-purchasers who have paid in excess of the purchase prices as agreed in the agreements of sale and purchase.\n\nMr Lee Yiok Seng (for the Minister for National Development): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am again replying on behalf of my Minister. Sir, at the Parliament meeting on 27th October, 1986, my Minister had informed Members that the lessees concerned will be given refunds within three months, ie, by 27th January 1987. All the lessees concerned have been informed to call at the HDB Sales Section to endorse the necessary legal documents so that the refunds can be made. If the lessees keep their appointments, the refunds can be made within two to four weeks' time.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Senior Parliamentary Secretary proposing to pay interest on all those monies held for over a year?\n\nMr Lee Yiok Seng: The answer is no.\n\nMaj Fong Sip Chee (Kampong Chai Chee): May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, so far how many refunds have been made, and how many refunds are still being considered? Since this is the first time the Senior Parliamentary Secretary is answering questions in Parliament, I should not be too harsh on him with other questions.\n\nMr Lee Yiok Seng: Sir, according to my records here, yesterday 16 applicants have called at the Sales Section to endorse the necessary documents, and they will be paid within two to four weeks' time.\n\nMaj Fong Sip Chee: How many are outstanding, Mr Speaker, Sir?\n\nMr Lee Yiok Seng: Sir, altogether there were 53 cases and we have called them to go to the Sales Section to endorse the necessary legal documents.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Sir, will these refunds be made in full? Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary guarantee that there are no deductions from these refunds?\n\nMr Lee Yiok Seng: Yes, Sir.\n\nVISIT OF ISRAELI PRESIDENT CHAIM HERZOG (Request for Statement)\n\n5. Mr Chiam See Tong asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in view of the unfriendly reactions from our neighbouring countries to the recent visit of the Israeli President, Mr Chaim Herzog, whether he will make a statement with a view to defusing the situation.\n\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Dhanabalan): Mr Speaker, Sir, we established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1969. Israel rendered us special assistance in building up the SAF when we gained independence in 1965.\n\nIt is accepted diplomatic practice to receive visitors or visits by leaders of states with which a country has diplomatic relations. Only the dates of the visit are the subject of consideration.\n\nIn December 1984, the Israeli Embassy requested a visit by their President and we agreed to invite him. The visit was to have been made in May 1985, but was postponed by Israel. In April this year, we agreed to a visit from 18th to 20th November 1986. This was to fit in with the Israeli President's visits to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga and the Philippines. There was no special significance to the visit.\n\nAlthough they conceded that it is our sovereign right to invite anyone, some of our ASEAN neighbours have expressed their regrets at the visit. There were also protests and demonstrations by various groups in Malaysia.\n\nAs a sovereign country, Singapore has the right to invite and to receive any representative of any country it has relations with. Other countries, even close and friendly neighbours, cannot expect us to view the world as they do. An invitation to the Israeli President does not mean that we accept or endorse Israeli policies. The President at the banquet in honour of the Israeli President stated Singapore's position on the Palestinian problem. Our views on this problem do not differ from those of our ASEAN neighbours. How these views are advanced must be left to each country. The visit has not in any way affected the national security or the national interests of any of our neighbours.\n\nThe security and stability of our ASEAN neighbours are important to Singapore. We will not allow Singapore to be used to undermine the security and stability of Malaysia or any other ASEAN neighbour. An example of this policy is our consistent policy of cooperation with Malaysia in combatting communist subversion.\n\nSingaporeans who visit Johore on business or pleasure must have read with relief that the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr Mahathir, had asked the Johore People's Action Committee to stop its protests against the Israeli President's visit to Singapore.\n\nASEAN has been a success because all members have observed the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of any member. We hope that this principle of non-interference will continue to be upheld.\n\nDr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister, before we agreed to the visit of the Israeli President, did we have any idea that the reaction in Malaysia would be so vehement? The second question is: will the visit change Singapore's position on the Palestinian and Middle-East related issues?\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, we were aware that Malaysia did not have diplomatic relations with Israel. We did not expect them to be happy about the visit. But we expected that they would treat the visit as a purely internal, ie, Singapore, matter.\n\nIt has always been recognized that while members of ASEAN have similar approaches to many regional and international problems and subjects, there are differences in nuances and even differences in substance on some subjects. A good example is the difference among ASEAN countries in their relations with the People's Republic of China.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, regarding the second part of the question, whether this visit will in any way change our position on the Palestinian problem, the answer is no. Our position has been clearly stated and we will stand by it.\n\nMr Chng Hee Kok (Radin Mas): Mr Speaker, Sir, besides Singapore, what other countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have diplomatic relations with Israel?\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, both Thailand and the Philippines, in addition to Singapore, have diplomatic relations with Israel. Thailand established diplomatic relations in 1954 and the Philippines in 1957.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Would the Minister agree with me that in respect of our relations with Malaysia, there are only disadvantages in inviting the Israeli President to Singapore and no advantage at all?\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already stated why we invited the Israeli President. I have also stated what our anticipated reaction on the part of Malaysia was. As a sovereign country, I am sure the Member for Potong Pasir must agree, we have the right to invite the leaders of countries with which we have diplomatic relations.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am asking him to state whether or not there are any advantages. I think we have to balance it, is it not - our interests in Malaysia with our interest in inviting the President of Israel to Singapore. What are the advantages? You do not just invite because you want to invite.\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already stated that we have had diplomatic relations with Israel since 1969. I have also stated that they did help us in the early years to build up our SAF and they have been asking us for some time to invite their President. When we have diplomatic relations with a country, it follows that at some point if they continue to request a visit, we must invite the leaders. It is normal accepted diplomatic practice. As I said, although we were aware that the Malaysians do not have diplomatic relations with Israel and we were aware that they would not be happy, we expected that in accordance with the normal practice in ASEAN they would accept that there will be a difference in our approach to Israel between Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Sir, would the Minister agree that with hindsight it was poor judgment and it was all a big mistake?\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not agree.\n\nMr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson): Sir, may I ask the Minister, as reported in the Straits Times' editorial on 6th December, that the Government rescinded its decision when it knew that Indonesia and Malaysia objected to Singapore's intention to open an Embassy in Tel Aviv, why did we, in this instance, proceed to accept the President's visit from Israel?\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that there have been press reports, the most recent of which was the editorial that the Member referred to, ie, the editorial in the Straits Times of 6th December, stating that we have not opened an embassy in Israel because Indonesia and Malaysia objected. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is completely untrue.\n\nWhen we want to establish an embassy in a country, we do not consult or discuss with third countries. It is purely a matter between Singapore and the country in which we want to establish the embassy. We have not established an embassy in Israel because we must allocate our limited manpower resources to those countries where we have substantial economic and political relations. Our\n\nrelations with Israel do not warrant the opening of an embassy in Israel.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Sir, in 1961, the PAP was advocating merger with Malaysia and the Prime Minister spoke over Radio Sarawak -\n\nMr Speaker: Let us have your supplementary question, please.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: I am coming to it, please.\n\nMr Speaker: I am not interested in the history of what you are going to say. I want the supplementary question.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Yes. It was said at that time, \"But at the end of it all, we have one mutual interest which overrides everything else, namely, the need to survive together, ie, with Peninsular Malaysia and the other Malaysian states, in a troubled and changing world and to create prosperity and stability despite the -\n\nMr Speaker: Supplementary question, please.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Give me a chance.\n\nMr Speaker: I am not giving you any chance because you are making a speech, Mr Chiam.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: All right. The policy of the Government then would be to survive together. Now I fear that the Government has switched over to a foreign policy of self-reliance. Is it in line -\n\nMr Speaker: Let us have your supplementary question, Mr Chiam, or you sit down.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: I am asking this question. Is it because in line with this policy of self-reliance, ie, Singapore going all alone, not caring about our neighbours, that we invited the President of Israel?\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not see how a policy of self-reliance contradicts a policy of cooperation with our neighbours. I have made it very clear that where the security and stability of our ASEAN neighbours are concerned, we are very mindful and that we will never allow Singapore to be used by anybody to undermine the security and stability of Malaysia or any of our ASEAN neighbours.\n\nMr Leong Horn Kee: Sir, may I be allowed to ask another supplementary question?\n\nMr Speaker: Last one.\n\nMr Leong Horn Kee: Thank you, Sir. May I ask the Minister whether, arising from the Israeli President's visit, firstly, have our relations with Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei been affected, and secondly, has it affected ASEAN solidarity and cooperation?\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Mr Speaker, Sir, ASEAN has been a strong association because member states have concentrated on building on common interests instead of dwelling on bilateral differences, even where there have been serious bilateral differences. I am confident that this approach will continue to hold and that ASEAN solidarity and cooperation will not be affected. DIVESTMENT OF GOVERNMENT COMPANIES: 6. Mr Chng Hee Kok asked the Minister for Finance how many companies have been divested and are about to be divested by the Government as a result of a review by the Divestment Committee.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has so far sold off its shares in four companies on the recommendation of the Divestment Committee. The companies are National Iron and Steel Mills Ltd, United Industrial Corporation Ltd, Dowty Aviation Services Pte Ltd, and the Singapore Airport Duty-Free Emporium Pte Ltd.\n\nTwo other companies, Singapore National Printers Pte Ltd and Resources Development Corporation Pte Ltd, are seeking listings in the Stock Exchange. These companies will be partially privatized through sale of equity but control will be retained by Government for the time being.\n\nThe Public Sector Divestment Committee has presented its report and its recommendations are being studied by Government. An announcement will be made in due course.\n\nMr Chew Heng Ching (Kaki Bukit): Sir, may I know what are the criteria for divestment of a Government company?\n\nDr Richard Hu Tsu Tau: Mr Speaker, Sir, the basic criteria have been announced previously, and this is that Government will consider the divestment of companies in which there is no longer any reason for Government to retain either partial or controlling shareholdings. These would generally consist of companies which are mature and where we consider that there is no strategic reason for Government to retain the shareholding,and they would include companies which might be in conflict with the private sector. There are a variety of reasons but these would be the principal ones.\n\nMr Chng Hee Kok: Sir, is the capital gain or loss in divestment a criterion in this respect?\n\nDr Richard Hu Tsu Tau: The preferred route of divestment would be through the placement of equity in the stock market so that there is a diversified and widespread public shareholding. This would require that companies floated in this way are viable and profitable. There are, of course, certain small companies where Government has a negligible minority interest which do not meet these criteria and these would be sold off to the majority shareholders. By and large, the record is that the majority of Government companies have been profitable. So one could assume that substantial and significant capital gains would have accrued over the years. CPF SCHEME FOR SELF-EMPLOYED: 7. Mr Chng Hee Kok asked the Acting Minister for Labour whether plans have been finalized to include the self-employed in the Central Provident Fund Scheme.\n\nThe Acting Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan): Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is still working on the plan to extend the CPF scheme to include the self-employed. The CPF has so far been developed as a social security savings scheme for employed persons. Although the social needs for housing, health care and retirement of the self-employed are no different from those of the employee, their\n\nsituation differs. In the first place, the self-employed has no employer to contribute CPF savings on his behalf. It will therefore be difficult for him to save at the same rate as the employed person assisted by his employer. Secondly, CPF contributions by employees are made through 70,000 employers whereas collection from the self-employed will have to be done directly. There are at present about 300,000 self-employed persons in a wide spectrum of occupations and professions earning a wide range of income. Their income also fluctuates from month to month. Ways will have to be found to facilitate the payment.\n\nIn view of these differences, the present CPF system cannot be applied in toto but must be adapted for the self-employed. My Ministry is carefully examining various approaches before we proceed with our plan to include the self-employed in the CPF scheme.\n\nMr Chng Hee Kok: Sir, are there any self-employed who are paying CPF at this point of time? If so, how many are there?\n\nMr Lee Yock Suan: About 200,000 self-employed persons are already CPF members. Of this number, 72,000 are active members. This means that they have been paying CPF recently. The figure of 300,000 is actually an over-estimate in the sense that some of the self-employed actually are employees. They may be doing some other job on a part-time basis. For example, quite a few working persons may have taxi licences. They may drive at night or they may be holding their licence as an insurance against unemployment. So we are narrowing down the figures further. TRANSFER OF CPF INTO MEDISAVE: 8. Mr Chew Heng Ching asked the Acting Minister for Labour if he will consider allowing the transfer of funds from a person's Central Provident Fund Ordinary Account into his Medisave Account to meet hospitalisation expenses, on the condition that the funds so transferred will be paid back into his Ordinary Account from his future contributions into his Medisave Account.\n\nMr Lee Yock Suan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the concern of the Member for Kaki Bukit for CPF members who do not have enough CPF savings in their Medisave Accounts to meet hospitalization expenses. There is, however, already sufficient flexibility built into the Medisave scheme to cater for the needs of such members.\n\nFirstly, a member who does not have enough savings in the Medisave Account can make use of the Medisave savings of his immediate family members. Secondly, if he opts to stay in a Class B2 or Class C ward in a Government hospital and does not have enough in his Medisave Account to pay the bill, he is allowed to settle the difference from future Medisave contributions.\n\nCPF FUNDS FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY (Raise to full Valuation price)\n\n9. Mr Leong Horn Kee asked the Acting Minister for Labour, in line with his recent decision to increase the percentage of investible Central Provident Fund savings to purchase gold and securities, whether he will also consider increasing the use of CPF funds for the purchase of a private property from 80% to 90% or 100% of the valuation of the property.\n\nMr Lee Yock Suan: Mr Speaker, Sir, the amount of CPF savings which can be used to purchase a private residential property is limited to 80% of the value of the property. The 80% limit is to ensure that should the market price of the property fall, the member's CPF money invested in the property will be safeguarded. This is the same limit which financial institutions apply when extending loans for residential properties. A CPF member can invest up to 100% of his Ordinary Account balance in one or more properties. In the extreme case, a member may, therefore, have no cash balance in his Ordinary Account at age 55, having invested all of it in properties. If a property is partly financed with a bank loan, a significant portion of the CPF withdrawn would have been used to pay the interest on the loan and is therefore in a sense consumed. In comparison, only 40% of CPF investible savings may be invested in Singapore\n\ntrustee shares and gold with a sub-limit of 10% for gold. Thus, only part of the existing balance, excluding the minimum sum of $30,000, can be invested in shares or gold. The rules are therefore already more liberal for property investments. The 80% limit on property financing appears reasonable and prudent. It should not be changed unless there are strong justifications having regard to the basic objectives of the CPF scheme.\n\nMr Leong Horn Kee: Sir, may I ask the Minister whether it is correct that in the case of HDB and HUDC flats, the CPF does allow up to 100% of the valuation price for purchase of such properties? If this is true, why is there a difference in standard between application of the use of CPF for purchase of HUDC and HDB flats as compared to the purchase of private properties?\n\nMr Lee Yock Suan: In the case of HDB and HUDC flats purchased from HDB, the buyer can borrow from the HDB up to 80% of the value of the property. He can also use his CPF for the 20% downpayment. In other words, the full purchase price, including the interest on the loan, can be met from CPF savings. If you add up the total sum of money withdrawn, capital plus interest, it exceeds 100% of the value of the property. In my opinion, this is too generous actually, but it is already there and it helps the lower income groups to own HDB flats. You may compare the sum withdrawn with the appreciation of the flat. The total sum withdrawn could be maybe 140% or 150% of the purchase price of the flat. And if the property value appreciates by that extent or more, then the CPF withdrawn would have been secured. But if the appreciation is less than that amount, part of the CPF has, in fact, been spent on housing. Therefore, for private properties, I am cautious and at this point there is no reason for us to liberalize further. As I have explained, part of the money is, in fact, consumed, and I think it is prudent for the buyer to estimate and calculate carefully, based on the 80% limit. They could either save more in their CPF so that they need to borrow less, or perhaps buy a smaller property, or even service the instalments partly from CPF and partly from their own cash.\n\nDr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa): Is the Acting Minister for Labour aware of the difficulties faced by buyers of private properties who make use of their CPF funds in two respects? Firstly, because of the limit of 80% of the valuation of property that may be used from CPF funds, very frequently the valuation by the banks or finance companies is already 10% or 15% below the market price at which the property is purchased. That means the purchaser already has to foot something like 20% to 30% of the total amount in cash. Furthermore, in a few years' time, is he aware that many of these purchasers will be in financial difficulties because they will no longer be able to use their CPF funds to meet their monthly repayments?\n\nMr Lee Yock Suan: Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that lenders tend to under-estimate the value of the property. The market price agreed upon may therefore be more than the valuation by the bank. But in the recent property market, with intense competition amongst the banks, I think they are tending more and more towards the market price. But this is one of the safety factors really. Whether or not the buyer eventually ends up in financial difficulty depends on how he has planned his purchase. It is very important for him to go in with his eyes open and do the calculations. For example, those who have bought their properties at high prices, at the peak of the market, I think nobody can help them because the prices have come down severely. But for the new buyers going in, they should realize that the maximum they can withdraw for property is 80% of the valuation. So they should plan their cash flow accordingly. WATER SUPPLY: 10. Mr Goh Choon Kang asked the Acting Minister for Trade and Industry what steps his Ministry has taken to ensure the water supply that Singapore needs.\n\nThe Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong): Mr Speaker, Sir, Government policy has been for PUB to develop all available water resources in Singapore. This has been done. We have recently completed the Sungei Seletar/Bedok Water Scheme. This is the last\n\nmajor surface water source available in Singapore for development.\n\nThe PUB has two water agreements with the Johore Government. These agreements assure us an adequate supply for our present needs.\n\nMr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh): May I ask the Acting Minister for Trade and Industry what precautions are we taking in view of the threats by various political groups in Malaysia to cut off our water supply and to take over the waterworks in Johor Baru in three months' time?\n\nBG Lee Hsien Loong: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member's question is hypothetical. There is no need to over-react. We have heeded the proverb in Chinese that goes \"Ju an si wei, you bei wu huan ( )\" which means, \"In times of peace, prepare for danger. Where precautions have been taken, there is no peril.\"\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Mr Speaker, Sir, are we considering desalination plants for Singapore as an alternative?\n\nBG Lee Hsien Loong: Mr Speaker, Sir, we rule out no possibilities for the future. For the present, it is not feasible, for a number of reasons. Firstly, desalination has never been done on the massive scale which would be necessary if we were to depend on it as our sole source of water supply. Secondly, it is extremely expensive, expensive in terms of energy because, to distil the water, you must have electricity or some other heat source to boil it, distil it and then condense the clean water. We have no cheap source of energy. If we were an oil state in the middle of the desert with natural gas coming out from the ground which had no other market, we would burn the natural gas and distil water. We are not that. If we had to distil water in order to have a water supply, I would present the options to the Member: between spending perhaps 10 times the present cost of water to get a bucketful of water and forgoing that bucketful of water, for a clean bath, I would go for the second option rather than the first one.\n\nThis does not preclude future developments. Maybe technology will change. It\n\ncould become cheaper. Maybe in time cheaper sources of energy will make distillation feasible. For example, nuclear energy could be one source of power, which would make it worthwhile for us to distil water. But where in Singapore would you put a nuclear power plant, with a safety radius of perhaps 20 miles? Where would you evacuate the population of Singapore should something happen to the nuclear power plant? It is out of the question. If ever fusion becomes a reality, maybe in a generation, well, it is possible that that will give us a cheap, safe source of energy which will give us a desalination capability. As of now, nobody has done it. Hong Kong, some years ago when the People's Republic of China (PRC) threatened to cut off its water supply, built the desalination plant. They have mothballed it because it is just too expensive to operate. I do not think we need any plants to be put in mothballs.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Mr Speaker, Sir, do we have the capacity to ration water to households by installing meters that shut off after X number of gallons per day?\n\nBG Lee Hsien Loong: That is an innovative suggestion. I will ask the PUB to look into the matter.\n\nMr Leong Horn Kee: May I ask the Acting Minister based on the planned capacity and usage, how long can our water supply last? Are there any plans to continue to promote water conservation?\n\nBG Lee Hsien Loong: How long it lasts depends on how much we consume and how much rain there is. I do not intend to disclose the figures. I do not think it is desirable. As for conservation, yes, we will continue to have water conservation campaigns; in fact, water conservation must not only be a campaign but must be a way of life, because this is a problem which will never go away from us. We have tracked our water consumption over the years. We have studied the figures and tried to find out what it is which determines how much water we consume, and we have come to one very clear conclusion: It is the GNP of Singapore which determines how much water we consume. Firstly, in factories and commercial buildings, the more you are producing, the more water is required.\n\nSecondly, even with a population in homes and households, the higher the GNP, the higher the income of the population, the higher the standard of living, the more water is used. It is a fact that 5-room HDB flats use more water per capita than 3-room HDB flats. And as the population upgrades, our consumption will go up. So year by year the demand is there. We have to restrain the demand by conservation, by careful use, and we have to increase the supply by developing all our water resources which are feasible. But we must never forget. This is a problem which is forever.\n\nMr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights): Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been reported recently that one of the water agreements has come up for review. Can the Minister tell the House what progress has been made?\n\nBG Lee Hsien Loong: We have two water agreements, 1961 and 1962. They provide for the price of water to be reviewed after 25 years, to take into account the value of money. That means the agreements still run. The 1961 agreement runs for another 25 years to the year 2011 and the 1962 agreement runs for another 75 years to the year 2061, which I think is beyond what any of us is likely to see here. But the agreements do not end. It is just a provision within the agreement that after 25 years the price of water can be reviewed, but reviewed to take into account the value of money, namely, only to compensate for inflation. I have to report to this House that there has been no request to review the water rates so far.\n\nMr Tang See Chim (Chua Chu Kang): Sir, I just want to know what proportion of water is actually flushed down the drain, and whether the Government has any plans to use sea water for the purpose?\n\nBG Lee Hsien Loong: In answer to the Member's question, I do not have a precise fraction of water which is flushed down the drain. I think PUB has done some of these studies. It is relatively small. PUB has also considered sea water. It is not an absurd idea. There is a possibility of sea water or recycled water, not of such a high standard of cleanliness, being used for domestic washing or for toilet flushing.\n\nWe have not found it feasible because it would require installing a completely new reticulation system. That means a whole new network of pipes has to be laid out. You have to make sure that you never misconnect the pipes and interconnect the two systems, which is a real danger. Thirdly, even if you do that, sea water is highly corrosive. The maintenance problems will be very expensive. If we use recycled water, for example, from your washing machine in order to save the water, and use it to flush toilets, it is dirty water. There is bacteria and bacteria will breed. It will smell. It is unhealthy. So far, we have not found it worthwhile to do. BILLS INTRODUCED: 11.52 pmENLISTMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL\n\n\"to amend the Enlistment Act (Chapter 229 of the Revised Edition)\", presented by the Minister of State for Defence (BG Lee Hsien Loong); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed.\n\nSTATUTE LAW REVISION (NO. 2) BILL\n\n\"to provide for amendments, additions and omissions considered desirable by the Law Revision Commissioners in their preparation of a revised edition of Acts pursuant to the Revised Edition of the Laws Act 1983 (No. 9 of 1983)\", presented by the Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. PROPERTY TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Property Tax Act (Chapter 144 of the Revised Edition)\", recommendation of President signified; presented by the Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed.\n\nCENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL\n\n\"to amend the Central Provident Fund Act (Chapter 121 of the Revised Edition)\", presented by the Acting Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. CENTRAL SIKH GURDWARA BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board Act 1981 (No. 17 of 1981)\", presented by the Acting Minister for Community Development (Mr Wong Kan Seng); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. STATUTES (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\nThe Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, this is a very short Bill. It seeks to amend the various Acts which are referred to in the First Column of the Schedule. The intention is to provide for offences under those Acts to be compoundable where at the present time provision does not exist.\n\nSummons cases for various offences which are not comparatively serious or technical offences take up a disproportionate amount of time and workload of the Subordinate Courts. These amounted, for example, to more than 137,000 cases in 1985 alone.\n\nIn some of these cases, the authorities have had no choice but to proceed by way of court proceedings, simply because the relevant legislation did not have provisions for composition. The amendments to the Acts mentioned in the Schedule will make these offences compoundable and therefore this would help to relieve the Subordinate Courts of some of these cases and permit them to be dealt with expeditiously by the authorities and will permit the Courts to deal with the more serious and important cases.\n\nBy this Bill offences under the various enactments which may be compounded will be prescribed by rules or regulations made under those Acts.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. Jayakumar].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 1986, gives legislative effect to three income tax concessions announced in the 1986 Budget Statement. Opportunity is also taken to include other amendments, necessitated by the cut in income tax rates, as well as to extend certain provisions of the Act.\n\nAn across-the-board once-off rebate of 25% to resident individual taxpayers for the Year of Assessment 1986 only was announced in the 1986 Budget Statement. Clause 17 of the Bill provides for this. Clauses 8 and 16 further amend the legislation to effect the reduction in individual tax rates, and the increase in the existing rebate from 10% to 15% on the tax payable on the first $10,000 of chargeable income. This will take effect from the Year of Assessment 1987.\n\nThe second Budget concession on the reduction in the company tax rate from 40% to 33% with effect from the Year of Assessment 1987, is made by the amendment to section 43 in clause 9.\n\nThe third concession in the 1986 Budget Statement was an extension of the existing tax incentive for fund management. The original scheme, which took effect in 1983, confers exemption from Singapore tax on investment gains from funds of non-resident investors managed by approved ACU fund managers in offshore assets. In addition, fund manager's fees are taxed at 10%.\n\nThe concession extends the scheme to include fund managers who do not have ACU licences but are approved for the scheme by the Monetary Authority, and to investments in local stocks and shares. Clause 3 introduces a new section 13C which empowers the Minister to prescribe the income of the non-resident which will be exempt from tax under the scheme. Clause 10 of the Bill amends section 43A to extend the application of the 10% concessionary tax under that section to any approved fund manager.\n\nI now move to the other amendments. In line with the company and individual tax reductions, the rate of tax withheld on dividends declared by a resident company is reduced from 40% to 33%, with effect from 1st January 1986. As companies could only be informed of this after the announcement of the company tax reduction, an adjustment is necessary for those dividends declared before the Budget Statement and in the early part of 1986, on which 40% tax had been withheld.\n\nIn making the adjustment, the net dividend received by the shareholder is regarded for tax computation purposes as carrying a credit of 33% only. The difference between tax deducted computed in this manner (ie at 33%) and that on the original gross dividends (ie at 40%) is credited to the dividend franking credit account of the company paying the dividend. Clauses 12 and 14 of the Bill provide for this.\n\nA transitional measure is also needed to ensure that dividends which are declared before 1st January 1986 but, under present arrangements, are assessed in the shareholders' hands in 1987, are instead assessed in Year of Assessment 1986. Clause 5 inserts a new subsection (2A) to section 35 of the Act to provide for this.\n\nFollowing the reduction in the maximum individual and company tax rates from 40% to 33%, the tax rate for non-resident taxpayers will be similarly reduced with effect from Year of Assessment 1987. In line with this, the rate of tax withheld on certain payments, such as interest, royalties and rents, to non-residents is accordingly reduced to 33%. This reduction only applies to payments of income which become assessable in 1987. Clause 9 amends section 43 of the Act to reduce the non -resident's tax rate whilst clause 13 reduces the withholding tax rates in section 45.\n\nUnder our tax regime, the rate of tax on the trustees of a trust and the executors of an estate is essentially set by the rate of tax on companies. Thus, with the reduction in the company tax rate, the rate of tax on trustees and executors is similarly reduced from 40% to 33% from Year of\n\nAssessment 1987 onwards. The legislation is amended by clause 9 of the Bill.\n\nAt present, the maximum tax credit given to a resident taxpayer under double taxation arrangements is 40% of his foreign assessable income, ie, the maximum Singapore tax payable on such income. With the reduction in income tax rates, it is now necessary to limit this maximum credit to 33%. Clause 15 amends section 50(3) for the new limitation to take effect from Year of Assessment 1987.\n\nThe tax incentive for operational headquarters was announced in June this year to encourage companies to use Singapore as a regional base. The incentive essentially consists of two parts. One, a 10% concessionary tax rate on income derived from the provision of headquarter type services, such as management, technical or other supporting services, to related companies outside Singapore; and the other, an effective exemption for foreign dividend income.\n\nClause 11 inserts a new section 43E to apply the 10% concessionary tax to prescribed income of the approved headquarters company. No new legislation is required for the second part of the incentive as the existing legislation, section 13(7) of the Act, already enables the Minister to grant the exemption on foreign income on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPresently, only cash donations to the National Museum are deductible against the donor's assessable income for tax purposes. In order to encourage private collectors to contribute art pieces and artifacts of historical and cultural value, I have decided that gifts-in-kind to the National Museum should also qualify for income tax deduction. Clause 6 amends section 37(2) of the Act to effect this from Year of Assessment 1987 onwards.\n\nEarlier this year, it was announced that voluntary contributions to the CPF by self-employed individuals are to be tax deductible, subject to a maximum of 10% of the individual's assessable income, or $7,200, whichever is less. Clause 7 of the Bill\n\nprovides for this. It also imposes certain conditions limiting the maximum amount of deduction, in the event that the self -employed individual also makes compulsory CPF contributions, and payments for life insurance premiums. This applies to contributions made on or after 1st August 1986 only.\n\nEmployers' CPF contributions are presently tax deductible. As the rate of employers' statutory CPF contributions was reduced from 25% to 10% with effect from 1st April 1986, an amendment is required to section 14(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act, so as to limit the tax deductibility of employers' contributions to 10% only. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for this.\n\nClause 2 is a technical amendment to bring up to date the definition of the term \"prescribed\" in section 2 of the Act. This will reflect the current practice by which the Minister can prescribe rules or regulations under various sections of the Income Tax Act, and is not confined to any one section.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed. 12.08 pm\n\nDr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa): Mr Speaker, Sir, some of these tax measures, particularly the income and corporate tax reductions, were introduced in the Budget earlier this year as part of a package of incentives designed to stimulate our economy. The Hon. Minister for Finance together with his colleagues must be very pleased to note the recovery we have had in our economy as a result of these measures. But during the Budget debate, several Members in this House, including myself, questioned the reduction from 40% to 33% in corporate tax rate and marginal income tax rate as to whether this was a sufficient reduction. At that time, the Minister replied that he thought this was sufficient but that a review would be made in the event that other countries, which are competing with us for investments, reduce their tax rates further. We now know that countries like the US have reduced their tax rates or reformed their tax structures. In the light of these changes, is the Minister considering\n\nfurther reductions? Of course, he can only say so in principle. He cannot tell us anything in detail until the next Budget.\n\nAnother question I have is in regard to the treatment of capital gains. I understand that any sale of property or shares or any assets would not normally attract any tax because we do not have a capital gains tax. But if the Income Tax Department should so rule that the gain is really an income because trading activity is involved, then that capital gain becomes subject to income tax. I think this has dissuaded a number of people and fund managers and so on from engaging in the buying and selling of certain assets, like stocks and shares, and even property. Perhaps a more definite ruling by the Income Tax Department may be helpful in this regard because I know of people who got caught in the income tax net as a result of such transactions in the past.\n\nAs to the provision for tax deductions in respect of gifts-in-kind to the National Museum, I do not recall seeing any limitation or limit placed upon the amount. I wonder also whether any safeguards have been drawn up in respect of the valuation of such donations. In the US, as in other advanced countries where such deductions are allowed, this has proven to be an excellent tax loophole and arbitrary valuations have been made even for Presidential papers of no consequence which have been valued at such a high rate for income tax deduction purposes. Perhaps the Minister could inform this House what safeguards are envisaged, particularly when one comes to value antiques and ceramics and so on. In the first place, there are antiques which are not genuine antiques and valuation can differ from one market to another.\n\nDr Richard Hu Tsu Tau: Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first point raised by the Member for Whampoa on the possibility of reviewing the corporate tax rate, I would like to point out that the effective rate does not apply until the Year of Assessment 1987. We are, of course, always reviewing our corporate tax rate to ensure that we remain competitive and we will continue to do so. As the Member quite rightly pointed out, I am unable to give him a specific response at this time.\n\nAs to the second question on capital gains versus trading income, this is a problem which has been raised for many, many years. I think it will have to remain an issue which has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. It will be nearly impossible to lay down simple and clear guidelines. I recognize that some of the complaints are from fund managers who would prefer a simple system. Unfortunately, this is not easy and I do not think any tax authority in the world has, in fact, arrived at such a simple solution. In principle, it is difficult to grant non-taxable capital gains for a company which is operating a fund or a business which deals in the transaction of securities. The fund manager obviously would like to treat all transactions of this nature as capital gains and therefore not subject to tax. If the Inland Revenue Department, ie, the income tax people, agree to such a proposal, then we will be treating this class of business differently from other businesses which pay normal corporate tax. Why should a company dealing specifically in securities be granted zero tax or concessional tax while the same privilege is not granted to, say, a manufacturing company? The question of equity arises and that is why it is not feasible to lay down guidelines which tend to favour this sort of operation.\n\nOn the third question of donations to the Museum and the safeguards which might be necessary to ensure that generous or wealthy donors do not use this as a means of avoiding tax, I can assure the Member that the Revenue Department who oversees the assessment of these gifts, in consultation with the income tax people, would exercise extreme caution in valuations. Their record on tax matters would justify such confidence and indeed I do not expect there will be large numbers of fake antiquities presented for donation purposes. We are conscious of the need to exercise caution.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: On a point of clarification, Mr Speaker, Sir. In regard to the treatment of capital gains arising from trading in stocks and shares by fund managers in particular, does not the Minister agree with me that if we want to develop a capital market this is a very\n\nserious constraint? In other words, if we were to allow all such transactions to be treated on capital gains basis, then our stock exchange, our securities market will be much better developed as a consequence. And I think it will be a small price to pay in that regard. One can make a distinction between financial assets and other goods which are inventories, eg, manufactured goods, and so on and so forth.\n\nAt the same time, under the CPF investment rules, there is a safeguard there already: you have to register your share and when it is registered you may then sell it, which normally takes six weeks to two months, and I presume there is no tax on the capital gains that may be realized for CPF investment holders. Why could a similar rule not be applied for fund managers and others who hold stocks and shares, provided they go through the process of registering the shares or a suitable time limit of two or three months which would deter unusual turnover such as speculation and so on? This might be beneficial for our economy?\n\nDr Richard Hu Tsu Tau: I would like to point out for the Member for Whampoa's information that incentives to encourage development of the fund management already apply in the case of trading in foreign shares and securities where trading income is subject to nil tax. What we want to avoid is to extend the same privilege to dealings in domestic stocks and shares by companies which deal exclusively in this class of business. The Income Tax Department is very generous in its treatment of transactions by individuals like yourself or other members of this House who buy shares on the stock market and make capital gains. In fact, I doubt whether any individuals gains from stock trading have ever been taxed as ordinary income. It is only unwilling to extend the same privilege to companies whose sole business is trading in stocks and shares because stocks and shares then becomes a commodity in which it deals. And we see no difference between dealing in rubber or tin and dealing in securities.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\n\nBill considered in Committee. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\nClauses 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClause 4 -\n\nDr Richard Hu Tsu Tau: Sir, I beg to move that Clause 4 be amended as follows:\n\nIn page 2, to leave out line 20 to line 5 in page 3, and insert -\n\n(a) by deleting the word \"and\" at the end of sub-paragraph (i)(F) of the proviso;\n\n(b) by deleting the words \"shall not exceed 25%,\" in sub-paragraph (i)(G) of the proviso and substituting the words \"and before 1st April 1986 shall not exceed 25%;\"; and\n\n(c) by inserting, immediately after sub-paragraph (i)(G) of the proviso, the following sub-paragraph:\n\n\"(H) commencing on or after 1st April 1986\n\nshall not exceed 10%,\".\n\nSir, the purpose of this amendment is to reflect more accurately the intention to reduce the tax deductibility of employers' CPF contributions from 25% to 10%, with no change to the existing treatment at the moment.\n\nAmendment agreed to.\n\nClause 4, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClauses 5 to 17 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nNew Clause (A) - \"Amendment of Section 13B of the principal Act is\n\nsection 13B. amended by deleting the words \"or 43D\" in\n\nsubsections (1), (2), and (8)(a) and\n\nsubstituting in each case the words \", 43D\n\nor 43E\".\". - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\n\nBrought up, and read the First time.\n\nDr Richard Hu Tsu Tau: Sir, I beg to move, \"That the new clause be read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, this amendment is consequential to the legislation which effects the tax incen-\n\ntive for operational headquarters in clause 11 of the Bill.\n\nThe amendment to section 13B will ensure that dividends declared by the approved headquarters company out of income which has been taxed at the 10% concessionary rate will not suffer further tax in the hands of its shareholders. It will enable the benefit of the tax concession granted to the approved headquarters company to be passed on in full to the shareholders, as is generally the case in our incentive schemes.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nClause read a Second time and added to the Bill.\n\nThe Chairman: This new clause is to be inserted immediately after clause 2. This will be done.\n\nNew Clause (B) - \"Amendment of Section 40(1) of the principal Act is\n\nsection 40. amended by inserting, immediately after\n\nthe words \"Fifth Schedule\" in the ninth\n\nline, the words \"and section 39(2)(h)\".\".\n\n- [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\n\nBrought up, and read the First time.\n\nDr Richard Hu Tsu Tau: Sir, I beg to move, \"That the new clause be read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, at present, individual taxpayers are allowed an annual tax deduction of up to $2,000 on certain educational expenses. This relief was introduced in the 1985 Budget Statement and was intended for resident individual taxpayers only. The amendment to section 40(1) puts beyond any doubt that non-resident individuals are not entitled to claim the deduction.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nClause read a Second time and added to the Bill.\n\nThe Chairman: This new clause is to be inserted immediately after clause 7. This will be done.\n\nAmendments will also be made to the numbering of clauses consequent on the addition of the two new clauses.\n\nBill reported with amendments; read a Third time and passed. HUMAN ORGAN TRANSPLANT BILL: Order for Second Reading read. 12.22 pm\n\nThe Minister of State for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong) (for the Minister for Health): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will move on behalf of my Minister. Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nIn 1985, 218 Singaporeans died of kidney failure. Many of these people could have been saved if only there were enough cadaveric kidneys available for transplantation. The Human Organ Transplant Bill seeks to do something about this problem.\n\nKidney disease respects no individual and recognizes no boundaries. It strikes down men and women of all ages and of all races, the rich and the poor, the educated and the illiterate. Many are mothers and fathers of dependent children. Before their illness, they had been working and helping to look after their families.\n\nTreatment for kidney disease is either by dialysis or by transplant. Without treatment, death is inevitable, often within two to five months.\n\nDialysis is not a suitable treatment for kidney failure. It has to be continued for as long as the patient lives. The patient's life is precarious. He is subject to infections and medical complications. Kidney dialysis is also disruptive. The patient has to be hooked up to a machine three times a week, six hours each time. It invariably leads to loss of employment. Consequently, the whole family is placed under tremendous stress, both emotionally and financially.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, transplantation is the treatment of choice for any kidney patient. The success rate for kidney transplants is good and it continues to improve. This is due to proven transplant techniques as well as new drugs which help to reduce tissue rejection. In Singapore, our very first patient to receive a cadaveric kidney transplant is today alive and well. She received her transplant 16 years ago, in 1970. Today, she leads a normal life. All she needs to do is to take three tablets a\n\nday, and that is the biggest and most important benefit for kidney transplants. It allows the patient to go back to a normal, active and productive life. The only problem is the lack of cadaveric kidneys for transplantation. For the whole of 1985 we only had one cadaveric kidney transplant. The question is: could we have done better?\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, every year more than 700 people die as a result of accidents. These lives were unnecessarily lost and wasted. Many of the victims were healthy people and they were in the prime of their lives. But in these tragedies lie a rare opportunity for us to turn a negative event into a positive one. We estimate that between 40 and 45 of these 700 victims of fatal accidents would have been suitable as kidney donors. They could give life to over 80 people each year, people who would have died otherwise of kidney failure.\n\nRecognizing this, we have been encouraging Singaporeans to pledge their kidneys for the past 14 years. The Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act of 1972 enables the donations to be made. Unfortunately, it has been a dismal failure. Only 27,000 pledges have been received to date. For the scheme to be successful, we need a total of 800,000 people to pledge their kidneys. But Singapore is not alone. No country in the world has succeeded with this system of active consent for kidney donation. It has been found that people just shy away from thinking about their own possible death. And surveys have shown that even those who are really willing to donate their kidneys have been apathetic about sending in their kidney pledge forms.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, we have also tried seeking permission from the families of accident victims at the time of death. Unfortunately, this too has not been successful. The reasons are quite understandable. The family members would be under extreme emotional strain and anguish. It would be very difficult for them, in their moment of extreme grief, to be able to come to a rational decision. It is usually easier to say no.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, the existing system has failed. Lives will continue to be lost. It is pointless and wasteful for us to continue in this futile manner.\n\nThis is a sad situation, especially since surveys have indicated that Singaporeans generally support the concept of kidney donation. It is acknowledged as a noble, a humane and an admirable act. The major religions have also acknowledged that organ donation is a very laudable act of charity. In fact, several religious leaders in Singapore have recently come out openly in support of organ donation in order to save lives.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned a few minutes ago, Singapore is not alone in its lack of success with the present system of active consent. Europe has also faced similar problems. Consequently, in 1976, the Council of Europe recommended to European countries to gradually modify their organ donation laws towards the presumed consent system. Following this recommendation, 14 European countries have now adopted this system of presumed consent, and they include countries such as France, Italy and Switzerland. Belgium is the latest country to adopt this system, having enacted the relevant laws only in June this year. All these countries are forward-thinking, very enlightened and progressive countries.\n\nThe Bill I am presenting this morning is also based on the concept of presumed consent. The Bill seeks to authorize the removal of only the kidneys of victims of fatal accidents for transplant in kidney failure patients. Unless the accident victim had objected to this donation in his life-time, it will be presumed that he had consented to the donation of his kidneys.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, the Government is aware of the different cultural backgrounds of our people and of their sensitivities and anxieties. We have therefore put in a great deal of thought in drafting the Bill. Care has been taken to ensure that all issues raised have been addressed and that all possible safeguards and precautions have been taken.\n\nLet me now go into the main features of the Bill.\n\nThe Bill affects only victims of fatal accidents who are citizens or permanent residents of Singapore.\n\nVarious categories of people have been exempted from this Bill. Firstly, minors under the age of 21 years of age and people of unsound mind are exempted. These people may not realize or they may not be aware of the implications of the Bill. They may not be aware that they have to opt out should they decide that they do not want to donate their kidneys.\n\nPeople over 60 years of age will also be exempted from this Bill. Unfortunately, our organs do deteriorate with age. Even under our present system of active consent, people over the age of 60 years of age have not been considered for the donation of their kidneys.\n\nSingaporeans of the Islamic faith have also been exempted under this Bill. The Islamic religion specifically prohibits organ donation under the presumed consent system. In deference to their religious teachings, the Muslims as a group have therefore been exempted. However, Islam does permit donation of kidneys if it is to save lives. Individual Muslims can therefore pledge their kidneys through the existing Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, some people have expressed their concern that this Bill will deny a person the right to decide what is to happen to his own body in the event of an accidental death. Nothing could be further from the truth. Each person under this Bill fully retains his right to decide what he wishes done with his body. If he objects to having his kidneys used for transplantation, all he has to do is to register his objection. His wishes will be respected, without question and without protest. He will be able to register his objection in a very convenient way. All he has to do is to fill in a form and send it in to the Ministry of Health. In fact, the forms will be pre-addressed and postage paid, and will be available everywhere.\n\nWe will maintain a computerized Register of Objectors. This register will be checked in every case before any kidney is ever removed. This is to ensure that the accident victim who has passed away has\n\nnot in his life-time registered his objection to his kidneys being used for donation. The register will also be kept totally confidential. Only the designated senior doctor in each hospital will have access to this register, and it will be his duty to check to ensure that the accident victim is not registered on the Register of Objectors.\n\nThose people who do not wish to donate their kidneys will be given the grace period of six months after the Bill is passed to register their objection. During this grace period, no kidneys will be removed under this Act. After the grace period people can still send in their objections at any time. Their names should appear on the Register within 24 hours of their forms being received.\n\nEach objector will then receive an acknowledgment card. This card will be of wallet size and it can be conveniently carried around with him. The card will confirm that his objections have been received and, secondly, that his name has been entered in the Register of Objectors.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, some people have also expressed the fear that kidneys may be removed from an accident victim who has passed away before he is truly dead. This is a very natural anxiety and I would like to assure Members that this is totally unfounded. The sole responsibility of doctors is to save lives and the Bill in no way changes this. The doctors looking after the accident victims will be battling to save the lives of their patients. However, should all their efforts fail, extreme care will be exercised to ensure that the certification of death is properly carried out. To ensure that this certification of death is properly done, only experienced doctors with specialist qualifications will be allowed to certify death in these cases. And it must be done by two separate doctors.\n\nTo eliminate any conflict of interest, these two doctors will not be the ones looking after the accident victim. Neither will they be members of the transplant team, nor will they be involved in looking after kidney failure patients. The two specialists will specifically and strictly adhere to a standard and internationally-accepted protocol to check for the slightest\n\nindication of life. They will check to ensure that there are no circumstances which may give rise to a suppression of body functions and which may result in wrong certification.\n\nAll removal and transplantation of kidneys under this new law will initially be permitted only in Government hospitals. There will be no monetary considerations involved. No one will stand to gain in any way except the kidney recipient.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, the kidney donation system in a way resembles an insurance system. The pool of people who consent to donate their kidneys form an insurance pool from which some kidneys may be available in the future. Like any insurance system, it is only fair that those who join are the ones who are more likely to enjoy the benefits from the system. The Bill therefore provides for those who form the pool of potential donors to have priority in receiving kidneys. It is only fair that they will have priority over people who have consciously chosen not to join the pool and not to donate their kidneys in the event of accidental death.\n\nAny person who has objected may withdraw his objection at any time. He will then have equal priority again with the non-objectors two years from the date of his withdrawal of objection. This delay is to prevent any possible abuse of the system by persons who opt out with the intention of rejoining the pool as and when they find out that they have kidney disease.\n\nMuslims who pledge their kidneys under the existing Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act during this six months' grace period will also have priority similar to non-objectors. Those who do so after the grace period will then have priority in the same manner as persons who have withdrawn their objections, and for the same reasons. This ensures consistency and fairness for everybody.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, the sale or trafficking of human organs is repugnant. The Bill will prohibit the buying and selling of human organs. This section of the Bill will apply to all human organs under all circumstances\n\nand not only to kidneys. This is to correct a gap in the existing legislation in this area.\n\nFinally, let me reiterate that much effort has been put into the drafting of this Bill to build in all possible safeguards for the protection of everyone who come under its ambit. It has been drawn up to ensure consistency and fairness. The Bill is deliberately restrictive to apply only to kidneys, and upon accidental death. It does not seek to deprive anyone of their right to decide or to take anything away from them against their will. It will not change anyone's lifestyle, nor will it take advantage of anyone's ignorance.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is motivated by the desire to save lives, lives that would otherwise be lost unnecessarily. We can do this at no cost to anybody. So let us have the willingness to accept a new idea. Let us have the courage to adopt a new approach to helping our fellow Singaporeans in need. Let us give them the gift of life.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I intend to commit this Bill to a Select Committee to give an opportunity for members of the public to present their views.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed. 12.46 pm\n\nEncik Ibrahim Othman (Tanah Merah): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill moved by the Minister of State for Health.\n\nIn supporting this Bill, I share the plight of many kidney patients who can only survive by undergoing dialysis or having a kidney transplant. During dialysis, they have to be attached to an artificial kidney machine for about six hours each time, three times a week. It is only a temporary treatment. It is time-consuming and the cost to the patient is very high.\n\nEvery year we have many new cases of end-stage kidney disease in Singapore. However, there are only a limited number of artificial kidney machines in our hospitals. Therefore, only a limited number of patients can use it at any one time. Owing to the present situation where demand far exceeds the facilities available,\n\nmany kidney patients will die from lack of treatment or even without receiving treatment. As such, we have to resort to kidney transplant to enable kidney patients to lead normal lives.\n\nThis proposed Bill will allow for the kidneys of persons who die from accident to be removed for transplantation unless these persons have specifically objected to it in their life-time. Anyone else dying from all other causes, such as illnesses or old age, will not be affected.\n\nThis Bill, apart from excluding persons under 21 years of age, or who are mentally ill or retarded, old people above 60 years of age, also excludes Muslims. I am very pleased to note that the Ministry of Health has discussed this issue with the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) and have excluded Muslims from this Bill. The exclusion of Muslims from this Bill is proper and good as it is in accordance with Muslim law. However, this does not mean that Muslims cannot donate their kidneys. I wish to inform my non-Muslim colleagues and friends that Muslims can donate their kidneys if it is for the purpose of saving lives. As such, Muslims may opt in and sign up as donors under the existing Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act of 1972.\n\nThe Ministry of Health, with the help of MUIS, must encourage as many Muslims as possible to opt in and sign up as kidney donors. The Ministry must ensure that when a Muslim opts in, the following stand by MUIS is taken into consideration:\n\n1) The donation is confined only to the kidneys;\n\n2) The kidneys must be transplanted immediately to a patient and not kept in an organ bank; and\n\n3) The next-of-kin of the donor, according to hierarchy under Muslim law, must give his permission when the donor signs in. I hope the Minister of State for Health will give his assurance that all the above conditions are met before removing the kidneys of Muslims.\n\nAt the same time, when Muslims opt in, they must be given the same priority in receiving kidneys as others who come\n\nunder this Human Organ Transplant Bill. They must also be given six months to opt in from the commencement of the Act. Those who reach 21 years of age should be informed or reminded about signing up as a donor. This is to ensure that more Muslims become kidney donors and will receive the same priority as others in receiving kidneys as and when they need it. Again, I urge the Minister to give his assurance to Muslims in this matter.\n\nSir, when this Bill becomes law, kidney patients will certainly be relieved as their hope of kidney transplants will be more easily realized. This Bill can be regarded as fair because adequate safeguards have been provided to prevent abuse. The Government should give wide publicity and explain to the people the benefits of this Bill. This will ensure that everyone fully understands the meaning of this Bill.\n\nFinally, Sir, I support the move to refer this Bill to a Select Committee.\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng (Buona Vista): Mr Speaker, Sir, the House will recall that during the Budget debate in March this year, the hon. Members for Toa Payoh and Ulu Pandan eloquently expressed their concern for the sufferings of patients with chronic renal failure and suggested to the Ministry of Health to consider introducing legislation for the automatic donation of kidneys for transplant purpose by persons who die in accidents with the proviso that a person can elect not to be a donor if he so wishes.\n\nAbout six months later, the Human Organ Transplant Bill was tabled in the House. Today, we have the opportunity to debate on this Bill. I am very glad that the Bill will be committed to a Select Committee so that the public representation can be considered.\n\nThis is as it should be. There are persons who are not in favour of this Bill for various reasons, personal, religious or cultural. The Bill recognizes this point. Clause 5(2) makes such a provision respecting the wishes of persons who do not want to participate in the scheme. A person can register his objection at any time before and even after the relevant law comes into force. There is therefore in essence no infringement of an individual's right.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, certain quarters have expressed their fears that kidneys would be removed before a potential donor is really dead. Clause 5(3) of the Bill should allay such a fear as the death has to be certified by two medical practitioners who are neither involved in the transplant nor in the treatment of the proposed recipient and must also possess appropriate post-graduate medical qualification. A further safeguard is that the removal and transplant are only allowed in Government or gazetted hospitals.\n\nClause 12, in dealing with the priority of the recipients, considers those who have not registered their objection, those who have registered their objection, those who have subsequently withdrawn their registered objection, and those referred to in clause 5(2)(g). But the clause seems to be silent on persons referred to under clause 5(2) (d), ie, persons under 21 years of age who require the consent of parents or guardians before they could participate in the scheme. May I seek clarification on this point from the Minister of State?\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, it would be ideal indeed if legislation can be avoided and our people can be persuaded through education and public campaigns to respond adequately to the crying needs of patients for another lease of life. We have tried for 14 years to persuade people to pledge to donate their kidneys on death. So far, about 27,000 pledges have been made but this represents about 3% of our need and to-date not a single kidney has been available from these pledges for transplantation. This scheme has not worked at all and is not likely to work in the foreseeable future. An alternative must be found and hence the present Bill. Under this contracting-out legislation, we may be able to salvage 80-90 kidneys from fatal accident victims each year for saving the lives of kidney patients.\n\nIn order to make the scheme acceptable by as many people and as soon as possible, the Ministry could do well by soliciting the assistance of religious bodies and other organizations to persuade people to overcome their apprehension or reluctance to donate kidneys especially\n\nbecause of superstition which, as hon. Members know, is not based on rational thinking and is therefore difficult to dispel.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I am satisfied with the safeguards provided and pleased that the Bill will be committed to a Select Committee and referred to the House again. I hope that the Select Committee will not take too much time to deliberate on the matter and will make its report expeditiously, as patients are dying for lack of kidneys for transplant.\n\nMr Chng Hee Kok: Mr Speaker, Sir, like my colleagues before me, I rise in support of this Bill. At the same time, I welcome the intention of the Minister for Health to commit this Bill to a Select Committee.\n\nAlthough this Bill, as the Minister of State has pointed out, will cost the people nothing, it has generated much interest and, in some cases, doubts and, of course, resentment. Therefore, we must redouble our efforts to explain the Bill to the people because it will be an irony if, in the process of trying to save lives, the Government loses political support or political ground.\n\nIn this respect, I have only one point to raise and this relates to clause 5(2)(e) which sets the upper limit at 60 years of age. As the Minister has already pointed out, we deteriorate with age and it is doubtful that 60-year old organs would be of much help or much good in organ transplant. But there is a more important reason. I suspect that this Bill faces more resistance from the older age group than the young.\n\nIn our society, death is not something that is a subject for humour and rationality. Because of this, as mentioned by one other Member, there is suspicion and fear. Therefore, if we can change the age group and lower it to, say, 50 years old, which I believe will make very little difference to the Bill, we may perhaps get the Bill more readily accepted by the people. To keep the limit at 60 years of age means that a lot of older citizens, who at the present moment do not understand the Bill fully, will have apprehensions and this may be exploited by those who opposes this Bill. I think by lowering this upper limit to 50 years of age, it will go some way towards getting this Bill more easily accepted.\n\nMr Speaker: It is exactly 1.00 pm. I suspend this sitting and will take the Chair again at 2.30 pm.\n\nSitting accordingly suspended at 1.00 pm until 2.30 pm.\n\nSitting resumed at 2.30 pm [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\nDebate resumed.\n\nDr Koh Lip Lin( In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Minister of State for Health in the introduction of this Human Organ Transplant Bill. The Hon. Minister of State has given us a detailed statement on the background leading to the introduction of this Bill and he has also told us the direct and indirect benefits to the members of families of people who will be receiving the organ. This is a Bill to save lives. I believe this Bill will be supported by the great majority of the people of Singapore. Of course, there will be a minority of people who do not have a clear understanding of the Bill or the true facts of the matter or who have been misled by others, resulting in their objection to this Bill.\n\nI would like to air my views with regard to those who object to this Bill. There may be many reasons for their objection. It may be because of their religion or their cultural background that they object to the donation of their organs after death. Some people think that they have a personal right over their own organs and they do not want to be ruled by the law. Actually, those who hold such views do not need to object to this Bill because the Bill expressly states that they could simply opt out of this scheme by registering their objection. Of course, registration may be inconvenient to these people but this small inconvenience will bring benefit to the others or the country. They should not object to this Bill just because of this small inconvenience as such objection is unreasonable.\n\nI believe that just a step before this Bill is put into implementation, the Government should step up its publicity through the mass media and other channels to educate the people so that everyone in Singapore will understand the contents of the Bill,\n\nincluding those who have, for religious or cultural reasons, objected to the Bill. On the other hand, there may be others who object to this Bill for political reasons. They oppose this Bill simply because they oppose the People's Action Party and so they want to take this opportunity to raise anti -government sentiments. I think that the most simple method to deal with them is to tell such people that this Bill has no particular benefit to the People's Action Party; it will only benefit the people of Singapore, particularly thousands of those who are suffering from chronic kidney diseases. At the same time, we should urge our people not to be misled by these politically motivated people.\n\nAfter the implementation of this Bill, I believe there may be a small fraction of the people who would indicate that they would not want to donate their organs. I hope the Ministry of Health will step up their efforts to propagate the Bill and educate the people and show them the benefits of this law, so that those who originally object to the donation of their organs may change their mind and join in the scheme.\n\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister of State for Health a question. The present Bill refers only to the transplant of kidneys. Is there any possibility of this Bill being extended to cover other human organs? With the improvement of medical science, I believe that transplant of other human organs may also be feasible and required to help those who are affected.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.\n\nEncik Abbas Abu Amin (Pasir Panjang)( In Malay): Mr Speaker, Sir, when this Bill is eventually passed many patients with kidney ailments will be relieved because their hope of obtaining medical treatment can be better realized. Whatever good steps are taken to save lives should receive proper support. Naturally this transplant of organs will be carried out in the best way possible as expounded by the Minister of State earlier. I consider that further and on-going information should be given so that all segments of the society will understand the issues that are involved so that they\n\nwill really understand the purpose and the method of implementation.\n\nI am relieved to hear the assurance of the Minister of State that all views with respect to culture, belief and religion have been considered even before this Bill was proposed, particularly the views of Muslims. I understand that he had discussions on the subject of organ transplant with the Singapore Muslim Religious Council (MUIS). The religious ruling committee or Jawatankuasa Fatwa has ruled that Muslims can donate their organs for emergency reasons and in accordance with terms that have been spelt out by the Member for Tanah Merah. I also understand that several Muslim countries in the Middle East have carried out organ transplants in order to save lives. But we must appreciate that the Muslim community in Singapore is not that confident about the Fatwa or religious rulings that I said earlier.\n\nWhat I hope is that the Ministry of Health, with the cooperation of the Singapore Muslim Religious Council, would be able to draw up special plans to explain to all segments of Muslim society so that any doubt could be erased and thus enable the Muslim community in Singapore to make their contributions without any religious qualms. I feel that the Singapore Muslim Religious Council can help to effectively disseminate information to the Muslim community in various ways, for example, through Friday sermons, religious lectures organized by JHD or the Muslim Missionary Committee and also at mosques, forums, over radio and TV, and also not forgetting the press.\n\nMr Speaker, I am happy that this Bill will be further examined by the Select Committee. I hope organizations as well as individuals will come forward to give their views so that this Bill can be further streamlined as the object of this Bill is to save the lives of patients who have hitherto suffered due to a dearth of donors.\n\nTouching on this Bill, on page 3, it is stated that this Bill exempts those who are under 21 years of age unless they have the\n\nconsent of their parents or guardians. I seek elucidation from the Minister concerned as to what is the method or what explanation should be directed to this group of people, that is, those Muslims who are under 21 years of age, when this law is in force and after the six months that follow, when they will exceed the age of 21. I hope I will get an explanation on this matter so that no difficulties will arise. Thank you.\n\nMr Chew Heng Ching: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in support of this Human Organ Transplant Bill. It ushers in a new era in our fight against kidney disease. It brings a sparkle of hope to the many victims of the disease. I hope the Ministry of Health and the Kidney Foundation will continue their task of persuading more and more people to opt in. I am sure my fellow Members of Parliament and the community leaders will play our part to encourage more people to opt in. In fact, the concept is so well thought out, so flexible, so humanitarian, that I am tempted to ask the Minister to consider extending the scheme perhaps at a later date, to other organs, such as the human eyes.\n\nSir, this Bill alone, though by far the most effective, is not enough to tackle the kidney problem which has robbed the lives of some 3,000 Singaporeans since 1970. We should continue to adopt a total approach in tackling the problem. This means making dialysis treatment more readily available and more affordable to kidney victims. We should continue with fund-raising efforts from charitable institutions and well-to-do Singaporeans to provide the necessary financial assistance to these victims. More importantly, we should also tackle the prevention side of the problem. The public at large is generally ignorant of what kidney failure is about, what causes the disease, how to minimize contracting the disease. May I urge the Ministry of Health and the Kidney Foundation to continue to place emphasis on educating the public on healthy living habits, basic health care measures, and other preventive measures in order to minimize contracting the disease.\n\nSir, coming back to the Bill, I have the following clarifications or suggestions to make to the Minister. One relates to the\n\nquestion of priority, which is that when a kidney is available from a donor, who among the potential recipients will receive the highest priority? I suppose the choice of the recipient rests with the five-member committee to be appointed by the Director of Medical Services. I want to know whether the next -of-kin of the donor has a say as to whom the kidney should be donated. What if the next-of-kin wishes the kidney to be donated to a kidney victim who happens to be a relative. Will their wishes be accommodated?\n\nNext, I want to touch on the question of opting out card. Clause 9 of the Bill states that any person who has registered to opt out will be issued an acknowledgment in the form of a card to be carried by him to prove that his kidney should not be removed in the event of his death through accident . Well, people are careless, cards get lost, and not many people like to carry cards in their wallet. For practical reason, and perhaps as a better safeguard, it may be better to reflect a person's decision to opt out symbolically in his NRIC, in the same way as we have done for his blood group.\n\nMy next point relates to clause 10 of the Bill which states that all objections will be maintained in a central Register. I presume this is stored in a central computer linked to various hospitals. I want to know whether removals or transplants will be allowed in the event of a failure of this central computer. Are there contingency measures in the event of a computer breakdown?\n\nThe next point relates to clause 12(1)(b), which states that a person who has registered his objection and subsequently withdrawn his objection will enjoy the same priority as a person who has not registered any objection only after a lapse of two years. While I understand this is necessary to prevent abuse, my question is, why two years? Why not one year? Why not three years? Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us on this.\n\nMy last observation concerns persons coming of age. These are people who turn 21. This exercise to allow people to opt out or to opt in is an on-going one. Presumably facilities for people to exercise\n\ntheir options will be made readily available at strategic locations in a constituency. For example, the community centres or the Neighbourhood Police Posts. My concern is how is the Ministry of Health going to inform the many Singaporeans who come of age every year that they have to exercise their option at the age of 21? We do not want donation by default, through ignorance or forgetfulness. Is there a procedure for this? Perhaps the Minister may wish to consider extending clause 12(2)(a) (iii), which relates to persons who obtain permanent residence and citizenship being be given a six months' grace period to exercise their option, to those who turn 21, ie, give them a grace period of six months after they turn 21 to exercise their option.\n\nFinally, Sir, I understand the Minister will be referring the Bill to a Select Committee. While there is a need to seek a wider audience on the Bill which affects many Singaporeans, I think it is equally important that the new law be implemented as soon as possible as there are lives to be saved. I therefore urge the Select Committee to carry out its task most diligently, most expeditiously and complete its findings as soon as possible. 2.50 pm\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to join in this debate. May I, first of all, refer to the remarks made by the Member for Nee Soon. He said that the Opposition shall be using this particular Bill to say things against the Government. I must tell him that this is a very unbecoming thing to say. The Opposition are also human beings. They also want to save lives. I support this Bill because its purpose is to save lives. How can he go about saying irresponsible things like that?\n\nDr Koh Lip Lin: Point of clarification, Sir.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Please, let me have my say.\n\nMr Speaker: He is not giving way.\n\nDr Koh Lip Lin resumed his seat.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: If there is any objection, it would probably be due to the controversial nature of this Bill. We are an\n\nAsian society. Superstition is rife. We have just heard from the Minister that in Europe only three countries so far have got this kind of a law. They are socially much more advanced than us. As I say, if there is going to be any objection to this Bill, it is probably due to superstition, to fear, and, I think, also suspicion of the PAP Government.\n\nAn hon. Member: You are adding fuel to rumours.\n\nMr Chiam See Tong: Well, I am not adding fuel to rumours. I say that if there is any objection, it is probably due to these reasons. Of course, any sensible person would support this Bill, because if they have friends who suffer from chronic renal disease they would know how not only those patients suffer, but their whole family also. In fact, I have been asked to bring up this question of whether the Government would like to put more money in dialysis machines. Because, from what I have heard, there are not enough machines at the moment to go around. Some patients have to queue up and they suffer as a result. So I would urge the Government that before they pass this Bill they can tell the public that there are enough dialysis machines for any sufferer of chronic renal disease who wants treatment on demand. I think they have to do that first before they pass this Bill. I had the opportunity to attend a chronic renal disease seminar three years back. The delegate from Israel was proud to say at that time that any patient who had a kidney disease could get a dialysis treatment on demand. I do not think we can say that of Singapore today. So I hope the Minister will look into this very important aspect of kidney disease sufferers.\n\nThe question of priority has been mentioned and we note that 15% of our population is not involved, due to their religion which, I think, we should be sensitive to. They may have strong reasons not to want to donate their organs.\n\nThe purpose of this Bill is to save lives. Let us say, we have two cases. One is a very acute kidney case, and he might die any time if he does not get a transplant.\n\nThe other is a patient who can live for another six months or a year. But unfortunately for this sufferer with the acute problem, he has objected. This is a moral question of saving lives. Do you want this person to die just because he has objected? Or to give it to another person who has not objected but he has got six months more to go? I think this is a moral question which the Select Committee has got to decide. The main purpose of this Bill is to save lives. In fact, this clause on priority is in conflict with the purpose of the Bill. There will be cases like that. Of course, there will also be people who may have objected because of superstition and fear. I think we also have to safeguard these people. For various reasons we have to respect their reasons for objection. They may have fears in their minds that their objection may not be taken note of. The Minister of State says that it will be computerized. But what happens if an accident happens and there is a fear in his mind that his organs may be removed? So I think in this respect you should also protect those who have objected. I think this Bill is ahead of our time and I do not know how long this Bill is going to be considered by the Select Committee, taking into account our cultural, social and Asian background. But in any event I support this Bill.\n\nMr Barker: Hear! hear!\n\nDr Dixie Tan (Ulu Pandan): Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I should like to commend the Minister and his officials for having gone to a lot of trouble to ascertain the views and the feelings of all segments of the population in the drawing up of this Bill, and taking all these views very seriously. I think most of the points that had been brought up by various peoples and by the various groups have been incorporated into this Bill. I support this Bill wholeheartedly and totally.\n\nI should like now to try and project a concept of the process of organ donation. Actually we should try to look at organ donation as a surgical procedure, much like operations that are being done every day in operation theatres in hospitals all over Singapore. Some people have expressed the fear that organ donation will leave a body that is hollowed out. This Bill specifically states that only kidneys are to\n\nbe removed. The kidneys are two small organs located at the back of the abdomen, and surgery to remove these two kidneys will not leave any vacant space within the body.\n\nThen I have heard some people talk of mutilation of the body. There will not be any more mutilation of the body than the result of a surgical operation, namely, there will be one more line on the surface of the body that can be seen. In fact, victims of accidents, unfortunate enough to become organ donors, will be people who have suffered much more damage, damage enough for their brains to be dead, and the likelihood is that they will be far more mutilated on account of their accident than on account of their being organ donors. I should like to really try to place this concept that this is a surgical operation, and indeed it is, because it will be done by qualified surgeons who are experienced in the removal of organs and who are experts in the reparation of the surgical wound.\n\nOne other matter. Kidney transplantation is not done for acute renal failure. It is done only for chronic renal failure. Acute renal failure is treated by other methods.\n\nFinally, I would wish to commend this Bill to all Members. 280 deaths from chronic renal failure in one year and so many from heart attacks and so many from accidents tend to leave us cold. These are just numbers. But anyone who has known a person suffering from chronic renal disease and who has known the suffering and the anguish of this person as well as the whole family concerned will no doubt support this Bill wholeheartedly. Sir, I wish to support this Bill.\n\nDr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Bill. This legislation attempts to save the lives of most of the 200-odd Singaporeans who die of end-stage kidney disease each year. And this figure continues to rise.\n\nFor the past 15 years, the Ministry of Health and the National Kidney Foundation have tried to persuade the public to donate their organs, their kidneys, and for all their effort they only received about 24,000 pledges. We need 800,000. So you can see how far short we are of that figure.\n\nIt is pathetic to see many Singaporeans struck by the disease, some at the prime of their youth wasting away on the dialysis machine, while at the same time healthy kidneys are not made available to them because of prejudice and fear. This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the size and depth of our problem. We cannot run away from this. It will be with us and it will continue to get worse.\n\nNo Singaporean must turn his back against this. We must fight prejudices and fears about organ transplant. We must persuade those who want to opt out to opt in. We must give hope to the 200-odd Singaporeans. Therefore, we must all support this legislation and convince those who oppose that there are sufficient safeguards in the Bill to prevent abuse. These safeguards have been mentioned this morning by the Minister of State for Health. One fear among Singaporeans is that doctors would simply remove the kidneys as provided by the law when the victim had not opted out before his death. I think this is an important concern. It is important because we must be aware that these kidneys will have to be taken from someone who may be dead but nevertheless has very real and meaningful relationships with people who are still alive. It is a very emotive issue and we must be very sensitive to this, and any high-handed approach will spell disaster for the Ministry of Health.\n\nIn this connection, a special team of trained counsellors should be made available in each authorized hospital to counsel and provide emotional support to the families of every potential organ donor. The team must not only be highly trained but they must be very strongly motivated and, above all, available on call at any time to handle members of the bereaved family. The potential donor's family should be screened from all unnecessary bureaucratic contacts and red-tape. In extreme cases or even in unusually resistant cases, the team should be authorized to grant an exception so that the Government would not be seen as totally insensitive and devoid of compassion or flexibility because, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must remember that while the plight of our kidney failure patients deserves our fullest\n\nsympathy and support, we must be sensitive to the relatives of the accident victims.\n\nAnother fear is that this legislation will give the Government that eventual right to all the organs of the body. There is a general concern among the people that the kidney is only the beginning of a whole gamut of organs to come. The Ministry must allay this public anxiety. I know that some of my colleagues here have requested that organs should not only refer to the kidneys but also to the other organs. But I would advise caution now. Let us go step by step. Let us win the confidence of the people before we proceed to the other organs.\n\nIn this respect, we should have a good programme to educate the public and I must say that the Ministry of Health has responded to the Feedback Unit's request for an information paper on this Human Organ Transplant Bill. This paper has been circulated to all grassroots organizations and I would like to place on record my thanks to the Ministry of Health. Mr Speaker, Sir, that paper contains questions and answers on the proposed legislation. I am not sure whether this paper has been given to the press. If not, I would suggest that it should be given to the press so that more Singaporeans can be made aware of the implications of this Bill.\n\nAnother concern by the more educated is that this legislation is an infringement of their personal rights, as what rightly belongs to them can now be taken away by the Government under this legislation. Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of the rights of the individual crops up very frequently at dialogue sessions. While we cannot deny the individual of his rights, perhaps we will have to persuade and appeal to such individuals that in our closely-knit society they should also consider the obligations to the society. It is not much to ask of them considering the amount of collective effort and sacrifices made by many other Singaporeans in the building of this country. However, the Bill is quite clear: anyone who is not happy has the right, and not only the right but also the opportunity, to object to donating away his organ.\n\nAnother area of fear is that those who object may face other forms of social disincentives. At present, those who object will have less priority in receiving kidneys. It is only fair that the people who are willing to form part of the pool of potential kidney donors should be the first ones to benefit from the pool. I think the Ministry must not resort to the introduction of disincentives other than less priority for receiving kidneys to those who opt out. The act of pledging one's organs must be seen as a conscious choice of the individual. Relentless effort to persuade must continue in addition to this legislation. We must support the Ministry of Health's six-month planned programme to inform the public of the law and its implications. A long-term plan will be the prevention of the disease through health education and improved health care at our outpatient level and the private clinics.\n\nI am glad that the Ministry of Health did not succumb to the pressures of the National Kidney Foundation to introduce legislation much earlier. It must also listen to others. While I can understand the enthusiasm and concern of those working in the National Kidney Foundation to legislate, it must be borne in mind that the issue is not that simple. We are living in a multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious society. We have deeply ingrained cultural and religious beliefs. We are Asians. Western societies may accept such legislation more readily but we must not hurry over this. Our Muslim community's views must be made known, for example, and in this respect it is good to learn that MUIS supports the concept of organ donation. We must encourage Muslims to voluntarily donate their kidneys in the manner permitted by the Islamic teaching under the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act, 1972.\n\nWhile there is increasing awareness of the intention of the scheme, apprehension remains especially among the less knowledgeable and the less educated. It is important that the less educated are well-informed on this. Persuasion and convincing arguments must be the way to achieve our ultimate goal. Therefore, the decision to pass this legislation to a Select Committee will give those Singaporeans a chance to speak out on matters of concern.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I hope by the Third Reading of this Bill, the Ministry of Health will incorporate whatever relevant changes needed in the Bill so that Singaporeans will be assured that this legislation is passed after considering and listening to the views of MPs, lay people and professional people. I support the Bill.\n\nEncik Wan Hussin bin Haji Zoohri (Kampong Ubi)( In Malay): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am joining in the debate to speak only on certain aspects of the implementation of the Bill when it is eventually passed. We all know that what has been written down will sometimes meet with some difficulties in implementation. By this, I am wondering how the Ministry will ensure without any error being made concerning the religion of a deceased person.\n\nThis Bill exempts Muslims. But we know that in the context of Singapore with its multi-religious people, it is not necessary for a particular religion to be embraced by only one community. For instance, Islam is the religion of many ethnic groups. As such, when a person dies in such a situation, I would like to know from the Minister of State how is he going to ascertain the religion of a deceased person. If he were to refer only to the victim's identity card, I find that there is no column in a person's identity card to state his religion. Only his race is stated. As such, I would like to draw the attention of the Ministry concerned to the need to rule out any mistakes, as far as possible, in this respect. Although this is a small matter, if mistakes occur, the risks or consequences are unpleasant. I would merely like to remind the Ministry to exercise caution and to find ways to ascertain an accident victim's religion because if he is a Muslim he will be automatically exempted from the Bill.\n\nDr S. Vasoo (Bo Wen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. The Bill will provide a new lease of life for kidney disease sufferers. At the same time, no amount of dialysis is going to help kidney disease sufferers. It is only momentary. But the Bill will in the long run provide a long-term solution to the problems of kidney disease sufferers.\n\nI have a number of points to raise in connection with the Bill. One is that there\n\nis some public concern about the extent the Bill is going to cover . The concern is about whether the Bill is going to stop with the kidneys or whether it will extend to cover other organs in the near future. This is basically the misconception some sectors are having and I think it is essential for the Ministry to erase this public misconception.\n\nThe second point that I would like to raise is the time span allowed. Six months' grace is a rather short period because there are a lot of Singaporeans who are less-informed and who may not know exactly the implications of the Bill. I think it is essential that, with the passage of time, one needs to allow the Bill to be well publicized so that more Singaporeans will become aware of the implications of this Bill. I think the more they know about this Bill and what it means to volunteer support for those in need, the Bill will receive the best support it can have.\n\nThe third area is whether this Bill will be subsequently reviewed because in time to come with less accidental deaths, cadavers would be less in time to come and there will be insufficient kidneys available, and whether there will be subsequent review to cover adequately to meet those who are suffering from kidney diseases.\n\nThe final area one needs to look at is to provide sufficient support for the bereaved families, particularly, as they are suffering from grief and therefore they should be supported when their beloved ones have suffered death. And I think the Ministry whilst implementing this scheme should provide a good system of crisis counselling to help breaved families through so that they can become more supportive of the organ donation scheme. It will help them find relief and eventually give the best support to the scheme itself.\n\nOn that note, thank you, Sir.\n\nMr Heng Chiang Meng (Jalan Kayu): Mr Speaker, I would like to say that life is a gift of God. Anybody who does anything to extend the gift, in fact, is helping him or her, as the case may be. I would also like to say that anybody against such an organ or kidney donation plan is perhaps\n\ndenying life itself. Listening to the comments and the arguments in support of the Bill, I find it strange that one very important issue has been missed out.\n\nAll these arguments are very rational arguments, very logical arguments. The objective of this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, of course, is very logical, that is, to save lives. But unfortunately the decision whether one wishes to donate the organs or not is not a rational issue. It is an emotive issue. It is an issue to be found in superstitions the fear of the unknown. Again, unfortunately, when people look for answers in this area, they do not look towards the Government. For issues of this sort, touching on religion, on culture and social values, most of them look towards their religious leaders. It is in this realm and in this area that I think we have to focus our attention.\n\nOver the past months we have heard various religious leaders of all denominations coming out in support of this proposal. Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to all of them to say it loud and clear in their churches, in their temples and in their mosques to ask their people and their congregation to support this Bill.\n\nMr Yeo Cheow Tong: Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the many Members who have spoken in support of the Bill. As I intend to refer this Bill to the Select Committee, I will therefore only reply to the broad points and not go into the detailed drafting of the Bill as this would be the job of the Select Committee to look into.\n\nSeveral of our Muslim MPs have spoken on various aspects relating to the Muslim community. My officers and I myself have been in discussion with the MUIS leaders on the various aspects of this Bill. I am very happy that MUIS has come out in support of the Bill. They have come out in support of the concept of organ donation, except that for Muslims it must be an active consent system which is covered under our present Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act.\n\nArising from our discussions, we have agreed that the pledge form for kidney donation under this Medical (Therapy,\n\nEducation and Research) Act will be redesigned to take into consideration the points brought up by MUIS and which have also been covered by the Member for Tanah Merah, that is, that the donation will be only for kidneys, that it will be for immediate transplant, and that the next-of-kin must give his or her permission at the same time when the individual signs his consent form. This will be done. The forms will be ready very shortly and we hope MUIS and the various religious leaders of the Islamic faith will help us to bring them to the ground and explain to their congregation, the Muslim congregation, about the various aspects of kidney donation and how to go about it.\n\nIn terms of those people who reach 21 years of age, how do we keep them informed every year? What the Ministry will do is to continue with its publicity programme on an annual basis. We will use the various media, newspaper advertisements, the TV, to keep our population continuously informed, so that those teenagers, when they get to the age of 21, will then be fully aware of the implications of the Bill. Hopefully, through the publicity programme, by the time they get to the age of 21 they will be sufficiently informed about the higher objectives of the Bill so that they would agree to donate their kidneys and therefore not have to register their objection.\n\nVarious Members have also talked about the need to better inform members of the public. The Member for Ayer Rajah has mentioned about the questionnaire which we had sent to the Feedback Unit and which has been distributed to the various grassroots organizations. Yes, the Ministry will continue with the publicity programme. In fact, only yesterday we took up a full-page advertisement in the newspapers to explain certain aspects of the Bill. This publicity programme will continue for the next six to eight months to ensure that members of the public will know over a period of time the major aspects of the Bill, what are the objectives, what are the problems facing the kidney failure patients, so that they will be totally knowledgeable of what we are talking about.\n\nThe Ministry will also be sending out flyers through the mail to every family.\n\nPUB has agreed to support us in in that respect. We will be sending out together with the PUB bills in the future flyers that will contain questions and answers to the major aspects of the Bill. So in this way every family will have such information delivered to their home. Therefore, this will enable us to reach every home in Singapore directly with the information. And, again, this will be continued periodically to ensure that Singaporeans know about this. 3.25 pm [MR DEPUTY SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\nThe Members for Nee Soon and Kaki Bukit have brought up the question of whether the Bill could be perhaps expanded to cover other organs. At the same time the Member for Ayer Rajah and another Member just now have also cautioned the Ministry against expanding coverage too rapidly. The Ministry will be adopting a very cautious approach towards legislation. First and foremost, we have to convince Singaporeans that the donation of organs to save other people is a good act, it is a humanitarian act, and it is an act which they should all support. So I think the process of persuasion and convincing must first be put in place. And over a period of time when more people become familiarized with the fact that, yes, organ donation is taking place, then perhaps they will also be very willing to donate other organs as well. At the present moment, there is no need for the donations of other organs, for example, the heart, liver, and all that. There is no need for that yet because no such are being have been carried out. With the progress of medical science, in the future we may go into those areas if there is a need for such transplants. But we would try the persuasion approach before we resort to legislation.\n\nThe Member for Pasir Panjang has also raised the point about what happens to those Muslims who reach the age of 21 during the grace period. How will they stand in terms of priority? Well, if they reach 21 during this grace period, they will still be covered by the grace period. Therefore, they need not fear losing out on priority should they opt in after the age of 21 during this grace period.\n\nThe Member for Kaki Bukit came out with a long list of questions. I will try to answer them wherever I can. He brought up the point that we should try and educate the public on healthy living to try to prevent kidney failure. We know what causes kidney failure. But medical science has still not really ascertained what leads to those causes. For example, we know that there is a connection between high blood pressure and kidney failure, between diabetes and kidney failure. We also know that certain infections of the body will result in the release of toxins which when they pass through the kidneys would end up in gradually damaging the kidneys. So this is the direct impact on the kidney functions which we know about. And our health fairs have been concentrating very heavily on getting members of the public to take care of their health, to watch their blood pressure, try to cut down their intake of salt and all the other substances which lead to hypertension and high blood pressure, and also to encourage them to go for a check for diabetes. So all these are on-going programmes which we will continue to emphasise, and they would definitely help in the long term to reduce or at least check the spread of kidney diseases.\n\nIn terms of the pledge cards being lost and the suggestion that we should indicate it on the NRIC, ie, the identity card, we have discussed this with the various Government departments. We feel that that card is only an acknowledgment card. The important thing is that all the names are being captured on the computer, and we are not depending on whether or not a person has that card on him when he dies. We are actually relying more on the computer and that is a more guaranteed way. So we will make sure that every person who dies in an accident and whose kidneys may be considered suitable, that all those names would be checked carefully against our Register of Objectors to make sure that they have not objected in their life-time.\n\nThe Member has also asked another question: what happens if the computer fails? That is not an unlikely scenario. It could be due to power failure. It could be due to anything. I would like to assure Members that if the computer system does\n\nfail, during the period that the computer is down we will err on the side of safety, in the sense that we will not in that case carry out any removal of kidneys under this Act. This is to ensure that during such unforeseen circumstances things are under control and that we do not make any mistake.\n\nVarious Members have also talked about the impact of superstitions in Singapore; the impact on members of the public would be a reluctance to donate their kidneys. Yes, we realize that there is a group of people who may be strongly influenced by superstitions. That is why we are working hard to better inform the public. We would also be encouraging the various religious leaders to be more open in their support. And taking up on the Member for Jalan Kayu, I hope also that they will come out and adopt a high profile in terms of explaining the stands of the various religions on this issue.\n\nThe Member for Potong Pasir has been having problems all along with his figures. Today he is no different. He said that I had in my opening address stated that there were only three countries that have to date adopted this system of presumed consent. This is where he is mistaken, unfortunately. I stated that there were 14 countries in Europe. And I gave four examples, not three. I gave three examples, plus Belgium, which is the latest country to adopt this system. The European position is quite interesting because most of the countries in Europe that have adopted this system of presumed consent are countries that have a strong belief in personal rights, strong belief in the democratic processes, strong belief in protecting the individual as far as intervention by the State is concerned. Yet these very conservative countries in terms of personal rights have been the pace setters in terms of enacting laws that allow presumed consent. In that respect they have been very progressive. So I would like to correct the Member for Potong Pasir. There are not three but fourteen countries that have adopted this system to date.\n\nThe Member for Potong Pasir has given a very simplistic example of one person who has agreed to donate and another person who has not agreed to donate. I\n\nthink it is a very simplistic example. The key thing is that we have got to persuade and convince as many people as possible to be potential donors. Then the pool of potential donors can expand. The reverse will be back to where we are today - 27,000 people who have agreed to donate will result very very certainly in over 200 kidney failure patients every year dying with this disease. So I think we have to be sure as to what is its objective. And the system of priority is in no way unfair to those people who have chosen not to be members of the pool. So we must get our thoughts very clear on that.\n\nThe Member has also requested for dialysis on demand before passing this Bill, although he said that he is in support of this Bill. This issue of dialysis upon demand has been brought up in this House before and I have given the reasons why, ie, dialysis is a very very expensive process and it is not really a suitable method for treating kidney failure. The best method for treating kidney failure is to obtain a replacement kidney for him, and that is a permanent remedy rather than a temporary remedy which will just totally destroy a person's quality of life as well as that of his family.\n\nI would like to thank the Member for Ulu Pandan also for her comments on the medical and surgical aspects of transplants. I am sure Members of the House would have appreciated her explanation.\n\nThere have also been calls for trained counsellors to counsel families of those accident victims who have died and who have donated their kidneys. Yes, we have a team of what we call \"kidney persuaders\" at the moment stationed in each hospital. Their job goes further than just persuading families of accident victims to allow the kidneys to be donated. It goes further than that in terms that they also counsel the family on their present grief. But the programme will be reviewed to see how we can expand that further.\n\nThe Member for Kampong Ubi has also asked how do we recognize Muslims. After all people from other races have also become Muslims. Well, there are a few methods that we use. One is, of course, to look at the identity card to see whether that name is a Muslim name, whether there is an alias there. But that is not\n\nalways available. What we will have to depend upon will be the feedback from the immediate family members who are there at the hospital, at the bedside of the victim. We will have to depend upon them to advise us because there is no other way for us to seek the information otherwise. And I am sure members of the family and their friends who are there would, when asked by the hospital staff, definitely be able to confirm whether or not the victim is or is not a Muslim.\n\nI think I have covered most of the major points brought up by Members of the House. Once again, I would like to thank everybody for their very useful comments.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat the Human Organ Transplant Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].\n\nREGISTRATION OF DEEDS (AMENDMENT) RULES 1986\n\n3.40 pm\n\nThe Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in the name of the Minister for Law as it appears in item (4) on the Order Paper.\n\n*The Motion reads as follows:\n\nThat this Parliament pursuant to subsection (2) of section 29 of the Registration of Deeds Act (Chapter 281), resolves that the Registration of Deeds (Amendment) Rules 1986, published as Notification No. S 267 in the Government Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 45 of 24th October 1986, as contained in Paper S. L. 46 of 1986, be approved.\n\nSir, as part of its computerization plan the Registry of Deeds needs to revise its practices, procedures and forms of instruments. In order to provide for consistency in practice in both the Registry of Deeds and the Registry of Titles, new rules have been introduced or old rules amended. Examples are:\n\n(a) the new rule 3 providing for changes to search and registration hours;\n\n(b) the amendment to rule 7 requiring that size of forms shall be A4 size; and\n\n(c) the new rule 11A providing for forfeiture of the lodgement of fee when there has been unreasonable delay by solicitors\n\nin complying with any requisition made by the Registrar.\n\nIf I may turn to some of the amendments, Sir. Rule 13. Under section 14(1)(c) of the Registration of Deeds Act, only instruments of finally surveyed lands can be finally registered by the Registrar of Deeds. Where the Chief Surveyor has not yet approved the survey of part of a lot vested in Government, notwithstanding that all those parts constitute a whole Government survey lot, the Registrar of Deeds nevertheless is not empowered to finalize the registration of the instrument vesting these parts of the lot in Government. The amendment of Rule 13 will now allow the Registrar to finalize the registration of outstanding instruments of those parts of the lot, subject to conclusiveness of their boundaries and areas, so long as they constitute the whole of a Government survey lot.\n\nThe new Rule 25 empowering the Registrar to accept instruments only when correct fees are paid will give legal force to the Registry's practice as agreed to by the Law Society of Singapore since November 1985. Prior to the implementation of that practice, the Registry had to deal with a high volume of refund of fees which a number of law firms habitually over-paid in small amounts for their instruments lodged.\n\nUnder section 19 of the Residential Property Act, 1976, a person acquiring any interest in the land under an instrument lodged for registration in the Registry of Titles and the Registry of Deeds needs to state his citizenship and particulars of documents of proof such as identity card, passport or birth certificate. As for companies, there is a need to state only their place of incorporation or registered address, whichever is applicable. The provisions relating to the registration of dealings in land are actually more appropriate if they are provided in the rules governing registration of land. New rule 26A which is similar to new rule 46A of the Land Titles (Amendment) rules, 1986 also provides that additional particulars are\n\nrequired. These particulars are the residential status, such as permanent residence and employment pass holder and other types of pass holders. For companies incorporated under the Companies Act, the new rule requires that the registration number of the company assigned to it by the Registrar of Companies be stated.\n\nForms 4 and 5 of the Second Schedule to the Rules concerning memorial of probate and memorial of letters of administration have also been revised for purposes of clarity. Sir, these amendments are not controversial and Parliament's approval of these amendments is required under the enabling provisions of the Act.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat this Parliament pursuant to subsection (2) of section 29 of the Registration of Deeds Act (Chapter 281), resolves that the Registration of Deeds (Amendment) Rules 1986, published as Notification No. S. 267 in the Government Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 45 of 24th October 1986, as contained in Paper S.L. 46 of 1986, be approved.\n\nRECLAMATION (CHANGI EAST)\n\n3.45 pm\n\nThe Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in the name of the Minister for Law as it appears on the Order Paper.\n\n*The Motion reads as follows:\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation by the Government of that portion of foreshore/seabed at Changi East containing an area of 18 hectares as shown coloured pink on the plan marked \"Land Office Reclamation Plan No. 3/86\" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.\n\nSir, over the past two or three decades, sand quarrying has been carried out in the Pasir Ris area. This has resulted in numerous deep pits in the ground filled with silt slurry and debris. In order to pave the way for development of Pasir Ris New Town, it is necessary to remove the silt slurry and debris in the sand pits and restore the quarry areas before such development takes place.\n\nThe Housing and Development Board proposes to discharge the silt slurry into a depression in the area off the coast of Changi, as shown edged pink in the plan marked \"Land Office Reclamation Plan No. 3/86\", a copy of which is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of hon. Members. However, in order to contain the silt slurry to minimize siltation to the ports' navigation channels, it is also necessary to construct a sand bund for the discharge of the slurry.\n\nThe area of the proposed sand bund above highwater level is about 18 hectares, as shown coloured pink in the plan. The cost of constructing the bund which will take about six months to complete is estimated at $30 million. It will be borne by the Housing and Development Board as part of the expenditure in connection with the development of Pasir Ris New Town. Since the construction of the bund necessitates reclamation of about 18 hectares of the foreshore and seabed, approval of this House under section 4(2) of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270) is necessary.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation by the Government of that portion of foreshore/seabed at Changi East containing an area of 18 hectares as shown coloured pink on the plan marked \"Land Office Reclamation Plan No. 3/86\" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.ADJOURNMENT: Resolved,\n\n\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Prof. S. Jayakumar].\n\nAdjourned accordingly at Twelve Minutes to Four o'clock pm to a date to be fixed.\n\nWRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS LAND ACQUISITION\n\n1. Mr Chiam See Tong asked the Minister for Law what are the reasons for adopting the policy of compulsorily acquiring land, without stating the specific purpose or purposes for doing so in many instances.\n\nMr E.W. Barker:\n\nWhen Government acquires land, the purpose for doing so is always stated. Where private land is required for a specific development, i.e. road widening, Mass Rapid Transit, school development, defence or Housing and Development Board purposes, the Gazette Notification under section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act will always as a matter of policy specifically state so. However, for cases where development is of general nature, i.e. for clearance of dilapidated structure under the Garden City Programme, for sprucing up land within the water catchment boundaries where urbanisation will not be allowed or for clearance of remnant squatters, the public purpose under section 5 in the Gazette Notification will then be stated as \"General Development\". In the majority of cases, the acquisitions are for specific purposes.\n\nANSON MP'S OFFICE\n\n2. Mr Chiam See Tong asked the Minister for National Development why was it necessary to break down the walls of the Workers' Party Branch Office at Anson Constituency in such a hurry, when he has not repossessed or broken down the walls of the People's Action Party Branch Offices at Anson and Potong Pasir Constituencies.\n\nThe Acting Minister for National Development (Mr E.W. Barker):\n\nThe premises at Block 145 Jalan Bukit Merah #01-1112 was allocated as an MP's office at a nominal rental of $5/-per month. It was not allocated to the Workers' Party as a party branch office.\n\nSince Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam is no longer the MP for Anson, the Housing and Development Board repossessed the premises as provided for in the license agreement. Now that it is no longer used as an MP's office, the HDB decided to demolish the walls and re-convert the premises to its original state ie void deck space for the residents' use.\n\nThe HDB did not allocate any MP's office to the previous PAP MPs for Anson and Potong Pasir constituencies.\n\nNUMBER OF H.D.B. UNITS DEMOLISHED\n\n3. Mr Chiam See Tong asked the Minister for National Development how many units of Housing and Development Board flats were demolished during the last five years ending 30th June, 1986 and what was the total value of those flats demolished.\n\nMr E.W. Barker:\n\nFor the five-year period from 1st July, 1981 to 30th June, 1986, the HDB demolished a total of 8,098 units.\n\nAs the HDB's new accounting system was only implemented from 1st April, 1985, the Board does not have ready information on the value of flats demolished prior to 1st April, 1985. RELOCATION OF CREMATORIUMS: 4. Mr Leong Horn Kee asked the Minister for the Environment whether his Ministry intends to relocate crematoriums to less populated areas; and, if so, whether it plans to move the crematorium at Bright Hill Drive to a rural location.\n\nDr Ahmad Mattar:\n\nThere are four crematoria in Singapore located as follows:\n\n(a) Mount Vernon Crematorium Complex;\n\n(b) Mandai Crematorium Complex;\n\n(c) Phor Kark See (Bright Hill) Temple;\n\n(d) Tse Tho Aum Temple.\n\nThe Mount Vernon Crematorium Complex at Upper Aljunied Road is owned and managed by the Ministry of the Environment. The Mandai Crematorium Complex was constructed by the HDB for the cremation of exhumed remains from cemeteries which have been acquired by the HDB for redevelopment purposes.\n\nThe crematoria at Phor Kark See Temple at Bright Hill Drive and Tse Tho Aum Temple at Sin Ming Drive are run by the respective temple authorities.\n\nThe Ministry of the Environment does not decide on the location of private crematoria. Such matters come under the Ministry of National Development and it has not received any proposal for the relocation of any private crematorium.", "url": "https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/#/report?sittingdate=09-12-1986"}
