Mr Ng Kah Ting asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the Singapore Government has been consulted on the Australian Government's intention to withdraw its military forces stationed in this region under the ANZUK arrangement; what is the view of the Government in relation to the statements by the Australian Government over this question; and whether by the withdrawal of the Australian military forces the security and stability of this region will be affected in any way.\n\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam): Mr Speaker, Sir, there were discussions between the Singapore and the Australian Governments prior to the recent announcement by the Australian Government of its decision to withdraw by the end of February next year all but 600 Australian troops based in Singapore. However, by April 1975 all but 150 of these 600 men would be withdrawn. The decision by the Australian Government has been as expected. The Australian Government has said that after April 1975 the remaining 150 men would help to facilitate programmes of combined exercises and to support those engaged in such projects.\n\nThe Australian decision will affect the present Five-Power Defence Arrangements, hut the usefulness of the defence arrangements remains because of the contributions which the other partners will continue to make. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, in a statement on 4th July, has reiterated that there is no question of New Zealand forces being withdrawn as long as Singapore wants them. The United Kingdom similarly will continue to maintain forces at their present level. This being the case, the Singapore Government is of the view that the\n\nFive-Power Defence Arrangements can make useful contributions towards peace and stability in the area.\n\nAUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES IN SINGAPORE (Setting up of espionage unit)\n\n2. Mr Ng Kah Ting asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the Government is aware of the fact that a so-called military electronic espionage unit had been set up by the Australian military forces in Singapore; and what steps the Singapore Government proposes to take to ensure that no such unit may be allowed to be set up here and furthermore that our non-aligned policy is not prejudiced.\n\nMr Rajaratnam: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Government does not regard the Australian Radio Intelligence Unit in Singapore as an espionage unit set up by the military services to undermine and/or subvert the security of Singapore and its neighbours. It is a normal practice of military establishments of all countries to maintain radio intelligence units to serve their defence requirements. In view of this, I see no grounds for concern that our non-aligned policy has been prejudiced in any way. SPECIAL BUS SERVICES FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN: 3. Mr P. Govindaswamy asked the Minister for Communications if he will look into the feasibility of the bus operators providing some buses for school children only on their bus routes, particularly at the end of the afternoon school sessions.\n\nThe Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin): Mr Speaker, Sir, as suggested by the Member for Anson, I shall ask the Bus Services Licensing Authority and the Singapore Bus Service Ltd, to look into the feasibility of providing special bus services for school children, at the end of the afternoon school sessions.\n\nIt is necessary, however, for me to explain that the public bus service is not the only available means of transport\n\nfor school children. There is in existence a separate school bus service, the expansion of which was one of the recommendations contained in the White Paper on Reorganisation of the Motor Transport Service of Singapore (Paper Cmd 21 of 1970).\n\nOut of an original fleet of 149 buses, it was hoped that by the end of the three-year Plan, i.e. June 1973, there would be in existence a total fleet of 600 buses. I am, however, pleased to disclose that the actual fleet of school buses at the end of last month reached a figure of 1,574 buses, which represents 2 1/2 times the target figure and more than ten times the original fleet in 1970 - three years ago. The rapid expansion of the school bus fleet clearly shows that parents and school children are most pleased with this service, and those who are not using this service as yet are advised to do so early instead of having to undergo the inconvenience of having to compete with the adults during the evening peak periods for bus travel.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy (Anson): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister says that there are 1,574 buses. Can he tell us what is the accommodation of each bus?\n\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin: Sir, the capacity varies with the type of bus. Some are mini-buses and some are large buses. Whatever it is, overall, they are performing an excellent service.\n\nWORK PERMITS (Exemption for Singapore blue identity card holders)\n\n4. Mr Cheong Yuen Chee asked the Minister for Labour whether he will consider exempting holders of Singapore blue identity cards who have resided in the Republic for more than 10 years from having to apply for work permits.\n\nThe Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon): Mr Speaker, Sir, work permits have been freely issued to applicants holding Singapore blue identity cards. Holders of Singapore blue identity cards are as a rule given work permits\n\nvalid for two years as against one year for other categories of applicants. It is not proposed to exempt holders of Singapore blue identity cards, who have resided in Singapore for ten years, from having to apply for work permits. However, because many of the Singapore blue identity card holders who are on work permits have family roots in Singapore, consideration is being given to granting this category of applicants with a five-year work permit instead of the present two years.\n\nThe hon. Member will recall that recently my Ministry announced that permanent residents, who pass the appropriate skill test or who possess acceptable training qualifications, will be eligible for citizenship if they satisfy the ten-year residential qualification. Holders of Singapore blue identity cards who are unskilled should, therefore, strive to upgrade their skill so that they can qualify for citizenship under this scheme.\n\nMr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh): Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware that the privilege mentioned by him only applies to workers in the industrial sector? Is he also aware that many of the work permit holders in the white-collar group, in other words, the commercial sector, will not enjoy this privilege at all because there is no way of assessing their skill as mentioned?\n\nMr Ong Pang Boon: Sir, the privileges will be extended to the white-collar workers, provided they have attained a certain level of skill. There are a number of recognised examinations which the white-collar workers can take. But, I think, we can go into the details when a decision is made.\n\nMr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah): Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister what are the criteria for accepting applications for work permits for foreign workers, particularly Malaysian workers?\n\nMr Ong Pang Boon: Can the Member please repeat the question?\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Sir, my question is: what are the criteria for approving work permit applications by Malaysian workers?\n\nMr Ong Pang Boon: Mr Speaker, Sir, their skill will be the main consideration.\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Sir, I have discovered that in the factories there are a lot of work permit holders from Malaysia, who have no skill.\n\nMr Ong Pang Boon: Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from skill, we also grant work permits to applicants who are prepared to work in the construction industry. It is quite correct that there are unskilled workers in the factories, particularly in the pioneer industries. But ultimately each case will be considered on its own merit.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah): Mr Speaker, Sir, while welcoming the Minister's remark that citizenship would be considered for those who are skilled, would the Minister care to enlighten what \"skill\" is in his terms? \"Skilled work\" is relative. What are the categories that the Ministry would term as \"skilled workers\", for whom citizenship can be considered?\n\nMr Ong Pang Boon: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has arranged with the Industrial Training Board to conduct skill tests for applicants who are work permit holders. If they can pass the skill test, they will be eligible for consideration for citizenship.\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Mr Speaker, Sir, may I know whether by and large there is any relaxation on the issue of work permits?\n\nMr Ong Pang Boon: Sir, I think the present work permit policy is already liberal enough, and there is no need to relax it any further.\n\nMARRIAGES AND DIVORCES (Particulars)\n\n5. Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Social Affairs, during the year ended 28th February, 1973, (a) how many marriages took place at the Registry\n\nof Marriages; and (b) how many cases of divorce occurred, and if he is able to give the grounds therefor.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of marriages which took place at the Registry of Marriages from 1st January to 31st December 1972 was 15,555. For the first two months of this year, i.e. January and February 1973, there were 2,636 marriages. The number of marriages solemnized at the Registry of Muslim Marriages from 1st January to 31st December 1972 was 2,662 and the number of marriages which took place for the first two months of this year was 452.\n\nThe number of divorces granted from 1st January to 31st December 1972 by the Supreme Court was 260, and for the period 1st January to 28th February 1973 it was 40. The number of divorces registered with the Shariah Court for the period 1st January to 31st December 1972 was 254, and from 1st January to 28th February 1973 it was 43.\n\nIt is regretted that the statistics for the grounds of divorce granted by the Supreme Court as well as the Shariah Court are not readily available.\n\nPUBLIC ASSISTANCE (Particulars)\n\n6. Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Social Affairs how many persons were granted public assistance during the year ended 28th February. 1973 and the total amount of aid paid.\n\nMr Chan Chee Seng (for the Minister for Social Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of persons receiving public assistance varies from month to month and shows a decreasing trend. During the year ending 28th February, 1973, the figure ranges from 14,948 in February, 1973 to 17,825 persons in March 1972. This works out to an average of 16,420 persons. The number of families or households receiving public assistance allowance ranges from 7,474 in February 1973 to 8,134 in March 1972, giving an\n\naverage of 7,753 families receiving public assistance.\n\nThe total amount of aid paid during the year ending 28th February, 1973, was $2,441,202.30.\n\nCRECHE IN SEMBAWANG (Building of)\n\n7. Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Social Affairs, with the progress of industrialisation in the Sembawang Constituency, if there is any proposal to build a creche in that Constituency, so as to induce more housewives to work in the factories.\n\nMr Chan Chee Seng (for the Minister for Social Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, there is as yet no definite proposal to build a creche in the Sembawang Constituency as priority has to be given to those areas with the highest concentration of population such as Toa Payoh, Queenstown, Kallang Basin, Katong, Woodlands, Telok Blangah and Bedok, where there are no creches.\n\nI can, however, assure the Member for Sembawang that the need for establishing creches in other areas of Singapore will be kept under constant review, and more creches will be provided when needs can be clearly established. The Government would also welcome the setting up of creches by those industrial concerns with large female labour forces, and to this end the Social Welfare Department has been directed to give every assistance possible to any firm that wishes to start a creche service.\n\nHOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD (Priority of flats for retired public officers)\n\n8. Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon asked the Minister for Law and National Development, since the introduction of the grant of priority for the sale or rental of Housing and Development Board flats to retired public officers, (a) how many such persons have been successful in being allocated flats; (b) how many of them have had their applications turned down and the reasons therefor; and (c) if the Housing and Development Board\n\nwill consider according the priority to retiring public officers one year prior to their retirement.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, under the existing policy only retiring public officers who are required to vacate Government quarters upon retirement are granted priority for the purchase or rental of Housing Board flats. Up to the 31st March last, a total of 374 such officers were granted priority. Not one qualified applicant has, in fact, been refused such priority.\n\nIt is not considered necessary to accord priority to such retiring public officers one year prior to retirement because they are only required to vacate their quarters when they retire.\n\nMr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that it is very necessary to give priority to retiring public officers one year before their retirement, because some of them have lodged certain complaints to me on this matter.\n\nMr Speaker: Mr Ch'ng, would you convert that into a question?\n\nMr Ch'ng Jit Koon(In Mandarin): Sir, in view of the fact that many officers have not been able to get Housing Board flats upon retirement, is it not necessary to advance their priority by one year?\n\nMr Barker: Sir, the answer I gave just now is that not one qualified public officer has been refused priority. In fact, they do not have to wait very long because they are granted priority. If they are not granted priority, then they would have to wait three or four years. Priority means that they get the flats before others do.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: Sir, can the Minister clarify what he means by \"public officers\"? Would officers working in the statutory boards be considered public officers?\n\nMr Barker: The answer is no.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: Sir, if a public officer does not retire but he has to vacate his quarters because it is to be taken over by the Government, would he be granted priority in the allocation of Housing Board flats?\n\nMr Barker: By \"public officers\", we mean public officers working in the civil service, and not officers in the statutory boards like the Port of Singapore Authority or the Public Utilities Board who have their own quarters. Their problems are really the problems of the particular authority concerned.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am talking about the public officer who works for the Government. If the officer is not retiring but his quarters is being acquired for some purpose, would he be given such priority?\n\nMr Barker: Sir, it depends on who he is working for, what quarters he is occupying, and who is the acquiring authority.\n\nMr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore provides quarters for their staff. Would a retiring officer from the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore be given priority?\n\nMr Barker: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member should direct his question to the Minister in charge.\n\nHOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD (Subletting of flats)\n\n9. Mr Cheong Yuen Chee asked the Minister for Law and National Development whether the Housing and Development Board will consider allowing tenants or flat owners to sublet their flats if the would-be subtenants are on the waiting list for the Board's flats.\n\nMr Barker: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing and Development Board is finalising a scheme to allow tenants or flat owners with small families living in three, four or five-room flats to sublet their flats not only to Singapore citizens but also to permanent residents and to work permit holders.\n\nMr J. F. Conceicao (Katong): Mr Speaker, Sir, in these measures that are being finalised, is consideration being given to ensure that the rents charged by the owners or by the tenants are not exorbitant but within reasonable limits? There are already indications that high rents may be the result.\n\nMr Barker: Sir, such consideration is being given.\n\nESTATE DUTY (Remission for sole family house)\n\n10. Mr J. F. Conceicao asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider introducing amending legislation to remit estate duty on a house which is the only one owned by the deceased, if the house is continued to be occupied by the family of the deceased.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member may remember that before 8th March, 1972, the exemption under the Estate Duty Act was up to $10,000. In my Budget statement for the year 1972-73, one of the tax concessions I announced was a remission from estate duty for estates worth up to $25,000. I am not inclined at present to consider any further concession.\n\nThe Member for Katong's suggestion to amend the legislation to remit estate duty on a family house would result in an unnecessary sacrifice of revenue in the case of the wealthy. For example, if, as has occurred, a family house left by a deceased multi-millionaire is worth $8 million, the remission of the estate duty on such a family house would be $5 million. I consider also that it would not be desirable to give remission other than within the limit I have set, on a sole family house specifically in distinction to savings in different forms, such as insurance policies, deposits in banks, Post Office Savings Bank, Government bonds, shares, etc.\n\nMr Conceicao: Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Minister realise that with the present escalation of prices of properties, the estate duty may well result in bankrupting a family concerned which owns one\n\nhouse, which might have been purchased around $20,000 or $40,000 but is now valued at about $200,000? The family may have to sell the house in order to pay estate duty and fritter away the rest of the money in rentals until they get a Housing Board flat.\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Mr Speaker, Sir, I realise the consequence to someone leaving $200,000 to his family. But I would expect anyone who has such a valuable house to take the usual precaution of transferring the house during his lifetime to his beloved ones.\n\nMr Conceicao: Sir, under such circumstances, can the Minister inform the House whether steps would be taken to maintain or stabilise the present level of prices of property, or even perhaps reduce them, so that the prices will not escalate further and thereby expose prospective inheritors of estates to this problem of having to pay very high estate duty and facing the possibility of losing the sole family property?\n\nMr Speaker: It is a long question, Mr Conceicao.\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Sir, if the Member is speaking for the person who owns the house, the suggestion to implement measures to restrict the increase in the value of the property would be unappreciated by this owner.\n\nCHIT FUND COMPANIES (Particulars)\n\n11. Mr P. Govindaswamy asked the Minister for Finance how many chit fund companies are licensed, and how many of them are operating.\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Mr Speaker, Sir, 57 chit fund companies were granted licences on 1st July, 1972, under section 7 of the Chit Funds Act. Of these, 22 companies have had their licences renewed and are still in operation as at 11th July, 1973.\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu): Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister tell the House what is the position of those companies which have gone into voluntary liquidation? I have heard that some\n\nof these companies are taking their own sweet time to finalise matters. Will the Minister consider imposing a time limit for these companies to complete their liquidation?\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Sir, if the Member could give me particulars of those companies that are delaying their liquidation, I assure him that I will look into the matter.\n\nSWIMMING POOL IN UPPER SERANGOON (Provision of funds)\n\n12. Mr Ng Kah Ting asked the Minister for Finance, now that a site has been obtained for a swimming pool in Upper Serangoon for the benefit of the residents and in particular the thousands of school children in the Upper Serangoon/Punggol areas, if and when he will provide the necessary funds for the construction of the pool, bearing in mind that there is no public swimming pool in those areas.\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Mr Speaker, Sir, the necessary funds for construction of sports facilities including any swimming pool in Upper Serangoon/Punggol areas must come from the approved yearly Budget allocations to the National Sports Promotion Board, or from donations and contributions which, under its Acts, it is empowered to receive. The swimming pool must therefore vie for priority within the Budget allocations with all other projects which the NSPB will consider.\n\nThe total need for facilities must depend on the overall strategy for the promotion of sports and healthy recreation. At the same time, it is necessary to determine also the total facilities already available including those developed by the Government, statutory boards, clubs, etc. With a plan and information on existing facilities, it will then be possible to determine the additional facilities that should be developed and the priority that should be assigned to each project. When such a plan has been formulated by the National Sports Promotion Board and the National Stadium Corporation, my Ministry will then be prepared to\n\nconsider the financing aspects of such a plan.\n\nTotal dependence on Government financing for the swimming pool at Upper Serangoon/Punggol, therefore, will mean delay, particularly if the funds required are large. If the Member for Punggol is anxious for the immediate development of sports facilities in his area, there are other ways of public or private involvement in the provision of such facilities. In this connection, I would suggest to him the method adopted by the Member for Queenstown. Through his initiative, a Queenstown Schools' Swimming Pool Building Fund was started. The Fund will be used to construct a swimming pool mainly for the use of school children in Queens-town. The Government helps by giving tax exemption to donations to the Fund and by running the pool after its construction.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol): Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister for Finance not agree with me that it is the Government's declared policy to provide more recreational facilities for the people, especially those living in the rural and suburban areas? If so, would he not consider that the construction of a public swimming poo1 in the Upper Serangoon/Punggol area a development project and therefore, notwithstanding its cost, provision should be included in the Development estimates?\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: I have nothing to add to what I have already said, which is, that when a strategy for the development of facilities is provided, the matter would be looked into. This means that I am prepared to consider on an overall basis the provision of facilities for the whole of Singapore, including the rural areas.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting: Sir, just now the Minister mentioned that Queenstown is getting its swimming poo1 through its own effort. May I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the people in the rural areas are not that well off. We have had many campaigns to raise funds\n\nfor certain projects, and more often than not we found that we had to rely on the people in the urban areas.\n\nMr Speaker: What is your supplementary question, Mr Ng?\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting: Sir, what I wanted to know is whether or not the Minister is aware of the fact that the rural people are not well off, whereas the Government has been responsible for building swimming pools like those in River Valley, Yan Kit, except in new Housing Board estates. And as these pools were built by Government, why does the Government now stop building swimming pools and pass on the responsibility to the NSPB?\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Sir, the NSPB is a Government agency for the provision of facilities such as the Member has in mind.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting: If that is the case, I would be grateful if the Minister for Finance would convey our request to the NSPB to look into the question of providing a swimming poo1 for the people in the Punggol/Upper Serangoon area.\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: The usual practice is for the NSPB to submit the proposal for our consideration.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting: No, Sir,I am given to understand by the Minister for Social Affairs that we would have to look for a site for a swimming pool. Now that the site has been found, we are told, \"Look, such and such an agency is now taking charge of it, why not go to that agency.\" I do not know where to turn to in the end.\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister not agree that the need of a swimming pool in rural areas close to the seaside is lesser than such a need in the urban areas?\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: I agree with the sentiments expressed.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting: Mr Speaker, Sir, to put the record straight, does not the Member for Bras Basah, my good Friend, know that although Punggol\n\nmay have a beach the Ministry of Social Affairs has plans in hand to develop that stretch of Punggol beach into a seaside resort? But, sad to say, I do not know whether he is aware of the fact that up till today nothing has been done.\n\nThe Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok): Sir, just to put the record straight. There is no plan by the Ministry to develop Punggol beach into a seaside resort.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting: Does not the Minister for Social Affairs remember that in the Estimates, a sum of not less than $50,000 has been allocated for this particular purpose?\n\nEncik Othman Bin Wok: It must be for other projects; not for Punggol beach.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting: I wonder if the Minister is aware that though it may not be for Punggol in particular, it is also meant for other beaches like Changi and Bedok as well.

W. Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. RECLAMATION AT TELOK AYER BASIN AND OFF NICOLL HIGHWAY: 3.29 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name, as it appears on the Order Paper. * The motion, standing in the name of the Minister for Law and National Development, reads as follows:\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation by Government of those portions of the foreshore and seabed at Telok Ayer Basin and off' Nicoll Highway containing a total area of approximately 370 acres as shown edged in red on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 6/73\" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.\n\nSir, the intensive construction of buildings in the central area, especially along Shenton Way and in the \"Golden Shoe\" area, necessitates early action to expand the road capacity and improve the traffic flow system in the vicinity. A coastal expressway, called the East Coast Parkway, is under construction on the reclaimed land from Bedok to Tanjong Rhu. The Jurong Expressway on the west coast, starting from the Anson Road/Keppel Road junction, will be built to link the central area to Jurong. To join these two expressways to form a freeway from east to west, skirting the city centre, it is planned to extend the East Coast Parkway across Kallang Basin out to the sea on to the existing detached stone mole, or break-water,\n\nand then back to land through Telok Ayer Basin to the Jurong Expressway at the Anson Road/Keppel Road junction. This system will enclose a large span of water at the seafront and create a 220-acre lagoon.\n\nMembers will recall that in November, 1967, approval was given by this House for the reclamation of 165 acres of foreshore and seabed off Nicoll Highway. It is now proposed to widen the existing stone mole and extend the reclamation areas by another 370 acres, as shown edged in red on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 6/73\". A copy of this reclamation plan is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of hon. Members. Thus, together with the 165 acres already approved and under reclamation (shown edged in blue on the plan), a total of 535 acres of reclaimed land will become available. The project will enable some 66 acres to be set aside for the Expressway and local roads, about 79 acres for public, social and cultural amenities, including landscaped walkways, car parks, hospital and school sites and even a centre for performing arts, 105 acres for commercial usage and condominium housing, and the remaining 285 acres for open spaces and promenades. Sites for commercial and residential development will be sold by auction to private developers.\n\nThe fill required for the reclamation, which will be undertaken by the Urban Renewal Authority as agent of the Government and is expected to be completed in about five years' time at a total estimated cost of about $294 million, will be obtained from the Johore Shoals.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation by Government of those portions of the foreshore and seabed at Telok Ayer Basin and off Nicoll Highway containing a total area of approximately 370 acres as shown edged in red on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 6/73\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.\n\nMIGRATION STATISTICS (REVOCATION) RULES, 1973\n\n3.33 p.m.\n\nMr Speaker: The motion, standing in the name of the Minister for Finance as item 3 on the Supplementary Order Paper, is subject to the Speaker's consent and the general assent of Members present for notice to be dispensed with under Standing Order 33. I give my consent. Is it the pleasure of hon. Members that the motion be moved?\n\nHon. Members indicated assent.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\n\nThat this Parliament pursuant to subsection (3) of section 7 of the Statistics Act (Chapter 299) resolves that the Migration Statistics (Revocation) Rules 1973, made on the 2nd day of May, 1973, and published as Notification No. S 169 in the Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 23 of 11th May, 1973 as contained in Paper S.L. 23 of 1973, be approved.\n\nSir, the Department of Statistics has been collecting passenger statistics by sea under the Migration Statistics Rules. Passenger statistics by air, however, are compiled from the passenger manifests submitted by airlines to the Department of Civil Aviation.\n\nThe Migration Statistics Rules were enacted in 1930 and over the passage of time returns drawn up under the\n\nRules are outdated in a number of aspects, such as in the terminology used and the scope and coverage defined. There is, therefore, a need to revise the returns and the notes contained therein from time to time. This in turn would need prior amendments to be made to the Rules. In order, therefore, to avoid the necessity of having to amend the Rules each time, the Schedules under which the statistics are collected are revised, it is proposed to collect migration statistics under the powers contained in the Statistics Act itself. This is possible as migration is included in the Schedule of subject matters covered by the Act. The Migration Statistics Rules can, therefore, be revoked. Collection of statistics under the Statistics Act would enable administrative flexibility to vary the format, scope and coverage of returns as and when circumstances arise, without having to resort to changes in subsidiary legislation.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat this Parliament pursuant to subsection (3) of section 7 of the Statistics Act (Chapter 299) resolves that the Migration Statistics (Revocation) Rules 1973, made on the 2nd day of May, 1973, and published as Notification No. S 169 in the Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 23 of 11th May, 1973 as contained in Paper S.L. 23 of 1973, he approved.ADJOURNMENT: Resolved,\n\n\"That Parliament do now adjourn to Wednesday, 25th July, 1973.\"-[Mr E. W. Barker].\n\nAdjourned accordingly at Twenty-three minutes to Four o'clock p.m.\n\nto Wednesday, 25th July, 1973.\n\nWRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION ACCIDENTS INVOLVING STATUTORY BOARD VEHICLES\n\n1. Mr J. F. Conceicao asked the Minister for Law and National Development, in respect of the various statutory boards which come under the general direction of Ministries, what has been the incidence for 1970, 1971 and 1972 of motor accidents involving vehicles belonging to those statutory boards and what has been the amount of compensation paid out each year.\n\nMr E.
