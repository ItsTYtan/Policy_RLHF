Mr L. P. Rodrigo asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in connection with his recent tour of West\n\nAsia, to inform the House (a) how the governments of the countries he visited regard Singapore; (b) how Singapore has benefited from the tour; and (c) what scope is there for improvement in relations with those countries of West Asia.\n\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam): Mr Speaker, Sir,\n\nwith regard to the first part of the question, I would refer the hon. Member to the two joint communiques and statements issued during the course of our tour. If he would read them, he would discover that they refer to discussions being conducted in a \"friendly atmosphere and in a spirit of mutual understanding\" and that there now existed favourable conditions, according to the communique \"for the promotion of mutually beneficial relations based on understanding in many spheres, particularly in the economic and commercial fields\". Though our visit to these countries took place at a time when they were preoccupied with the winding up of the Arab-Israeli conflict and receiving an unending stream of more distinguished visitors, the Singapore delegation was warmly received, entertained and afforded generous time for discussions with very busy Ministers.\n\nIn regard to the second part of the question, the personal contacts with Arab leaders and officials enabled the Singapore delegation to clear doubts and misunderstandings in regard to Singapore's stand on issues which the Arabs consider crucial. It is my view - which is borne out by the two joint communiques - that such misunderstandings as may have existed have now been cleared.\n\nThe visit also enabled us to learn directly from Arab leaders of their political and economic aspirations and in what way these could be assisted through co-operation with Singapore.\n\nOur discussions brought to surface the large areas of ignorance the Singapore and West Asian countries had as regards potentialities for economic cooperation. I should, however, stress that much of Arab aspirations in the economic and technology fields would be met by the major and wealthier industrial countries. However, during the course of our discussions the leaders of West Asia thought there were residual areas for mutually beneficial cooperation between Singapore and the oil-rich countries of West Asia. Like many developing countries, they are\n\nwary of becoming too dependent economically on a few industrial nations. The leaders of West Asia were unaware, until it was pointed out to them, that Singapore had some expertise in such things as port development, public housing, banking, ship-repairing, shipbuilding and industrial development, which would be more relevant to developing countries because Singapore itself was a developing country.\n\nWith regard to the third part of the question, the scope for improvement of relations with West Asian countries will depend largely on ourselves and our entrepreneurs. We cannot expect the West Asian countries to court Singapore because they have more suitors than they can cope with and with far more to offer. It is, therefore, up to us to take the initiative and convince the countries of West Asia that mutually beneficial relations could be developed with us.\n\nIn this connection I am happy to note that our Chambers of Commerce, industrialists and bankers are organising a trade mission to visit West Asian countries to study and explore prospects. However, this should be supplemented by exchanges of cultural missions and promotion of tourism between Singapore and West Asian countries which quite regrettably our citizens are inclined to bypass on their way to Europe.\n\nDr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng): Sir, would the Minister consider the setting up of a more permanent office in that part of West Asia, such as an embassy, so that continuity of what has been established can be maintained, and it can also help them utilise and invest the expected US$50 million which they get from their oil trade?\n\nMr Rajaratnam: Sir, my Ministry has always considered such matters. But I have no doubt that, as our relations with the West Asian countries grow and develop, the establishment of missions at different levels would be given more serious consideration during the coming years.\n\nMr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah): Sir, in view of the Minister's reply that Singapore and the Arab countries are friendly, what are the chances of Singapore getting cheaper oil?\n\nMr Rajaratnam: Sir, the chances of Singapore getting cheaper oil are as good as the chances of other countries getting cheaper oil.\n\nSINGAPORE BUS SERVICE LIMITED (Measures to improve service)\n\n2. Encik Abdul Aziz Karim asked the Minister for Communications if the Government (a) will consider the withdrawal of the licence granted to the Singapore Bus Service (Private) Limited, in the public interest; (b) will take over the rights and interests of the Singapore Bus Service (Private) Limited; (c) will take steps to establish a statutory corporation to operate the bus services and, if necessary, the other public transportation systems, in which the Government should hold a reasonable proportion of shares directly or indirectly; (d) will carry out a proper valuation of the assets of the Singapore Bus Service (Private) Limited and allocate to the owners an appropriate number of shares in relation to the valued assets at the material time of share allocation and such shares shall be disposed to the Government if required; (e) will invite the participation of other interested parties and groups as co-operative members; (f) will take all possible measures to make the operation viable and efficient; (g) will ensure that the statutory corporation works in the public interest; and (h) will take all measures, including the provision of funds, to develop an efficient mass rapid transit system in the next one to two decades to supplement the bus system.\n\nThe Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin): Mr Speaker, Sir, before I begin my answer, may I first preface my remarks by seeking your indulgence and that of hon. Members of the House if I provide an answer\n\nthat is rather long, in view of the fact that the Question for Oral Answer tabled by the Member for Kallang is rather long, probably the longest on record, covering one-third of the first page of the Order Paper. And in order to do justice to a subject of public interest, the answer would also have to be reasonably long.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, let me first assure the hon. Member for Kallang that if it is in the public interest to do so, I would have no hesitation in withdrawing the licence of Singapore Bus Service Ltd (SBS). But I do not believe it would be in the public interest to do so now. Other measures would serve the public interest better.\n\nSBS began operations about four months ago. It took over the assets and services of the former three bus companies - Amalgamated Bus Co., Associated Bus Services and United Bus Co. With the assets also came many problems. For instance, it inherited a bus fleet, on paper, of 2,000 buses of which over 400 were broken down and laid-up. This fleet also comprised no less than 17 different makes. Many of the buses had also been repaired, in the past, using non-standard parts or parts cannibalised, or \"transplanted\" as the Member worded it, from other buses. In the past, there was much duplication of routes and services because of the depot locations of the three former bus companies and to allow each of the three companies a fair share of the profitable and unprofitable routes.\n\nWith the starting up of operations by SBS and to ensure the efficient management and operation of the sole public bus service, a tripartite committee was formed. This is the Bus Services Reorganisation Committee (BSRC) made up of officials from the Ministry of Communications and Registry of Vehicles, the Managing Director of SBS and the General Secretary of SILO, which represents the bus workers. The BSRC meets weekly, monitoring the operations of SBS and setting the targets for the bus management to attain.\n\nThe principal immediate tasks of BSRC are: -\n\n(a) To get the 400 buses now not in service repaired and put back on the road, as soon as possible. SBS has contracted this work to a private firm of motor repairers to be completed originally by April at an estimated cost of $1.2 million, excluding replacement of major components, of which SBS has on order 227 new engines, gear boxes and rear axles costing another $2 million. Owing to the number of different makes operated, a comprehensive range of spare parts for all the laid-up buses is not available. Only 45 of the 400 laid-up buses were repaired up to 4th March. Now it does not appear likely that the balance of the 400 buses will be repaired until much later than April. The situation should improve when the major components on order are delivered. To speed up the work, SBS will undertake some of the repair work itself with the new personnel it would be employing and temporary repair facilities that are now being provided at the existing depots. In addition, SBS has invited other private motor repairers to contract for some of the repair work.\n\n(b) To improve the standard of maintenance of the buses. This involves setting up a Central Depot and Workshop on a 17-acre site at Braddell Road, which has been leased from the Housing and Development Board for 15 years. This Central Depot and Workshop is to be properly staffed and equipped. Building plans are now being put up by SBS' architects, assisted by workshop consultants from major motor assemblers, repairers and suppliers. Under-operation of buses, through poor standards of maintenance, has been a serious defect. The following financial penalties were imposed on the three former bus companies over 1972 and 1973, before the formation of SBS, for under-operation of services: -\n ABC $ 46,000\n\nABS $ 73,800\n\nUBC $ 126,350\n\n---------\n\n$ 246,150\n\n=========\n\nAlthough SBS has provided a performance bond of $500,000, it is not intended to exact any financial penalty for under-operation of buses until after sufficient time has elapsed for all the 400 laid-up buses to be repaired and put back on the road.\n\n(c) To require SBS to undertake a faster replacement programme of old buses. This would involve the purchase of a minimum of 1,000 new buses over the next three years, 400 of which would be replacements for old buses over 12 years old, and 600 would be as additions to the fleet. This would cost an estimated $65 million, including interest charges. Between November last year and end of February this year, SBS purchased and put into operation a total of 152 new buses costing $8.4 million, which increased the carrying capacity of its fleet by 11,100 passengers.\n\nThe measures required of SBS to improve the public bus service involve investment of large sums of money. SBS started operations on 1st November last year, with a paid-up capital of $11 million and net assets (i.e, net book value of buses less hire purchase obligations) of $30 million. The net asset value was determined by a professional firm of management consultants, SGV-Goh Pte Ltd, in September last year in a preliminary valuation for purposes of initial allotment of shares in SBS to its three component companies - ABC, ABS and UBC. The consultants were commissioned by the three bus companies for this purpose.\n\nA fair standard of service would require assets of some $90 million. No one would invest such capital if there is a certainty of losses and no returns. Had the old bus fares, in existence since April 1971, not been revised from 10th February, SBS would have headed for substantial losses. It would have ended up like the Singapore Traction Company.\n\nSeveral conditions have to be satisfied by SBS in consequence of the bus fare revision being allowed: -\n\n(a) To provide better terms and conditions of service for its 9,000 workers\n\nby implementing, in full, recommendations made by the National Wages Council (NWC), from time to time. Also, the provision of adequate rest rooms, canteens and toilet facilities at all main bus terminals for its workers, which are practically non-existent at present.\n\n(b) As SBS is operating an essential public, service, its profits, if any, should not be unrestricted and at the expense of lowering the standard of service. Accordingly, its annual pre-tax profits for the first three years would be limited to a maximum of 8 per cent of its net assets (i.e, net book value of buses less hire purchase obligations) as certified by their auditors.\n\n(c) Should annual pre-tax profits exceed the limit of 8 per cent, the surplus would be ploughed back for the purchase of yet more new buses, i.e. SBS would have to embark on an even faster rate of replacement than that mentioned earlier.\n\nThe Bus Services Licensing Authority Act was amended effective as from September last year to provide for an Inspector to be appointed to inspect the affairs of SBS, if necessary. The report of the Inspector could be published if it is in the public interest to do so. I would not hesitate to use these powers if the management of SBS is found to be abusing their positions and sacrificing the public interest. So far, the need has not arisen. I am monitoring developments closely in conjunction with the BSRC.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, it is not the intention to withdraw the licence of SBS, establish a statutory corporation, and take over its functions. I am not sure what the hon. Member refers to when he mentions \"other public transportation systems\". If he is referring to school buses, taxis, etc, may I say that there are 1,860 registered school buses, 350 of which are under the NTUC Comfort Scheme. There are 5,004 taxis, 1,225' of which are in. NTUC Comfort. And up to 9th March, a total of 1,135 Adult Worker Contract (AWC) permits were issued to 959 school buses and 176 to\n\ngoods and other vehicles to provide transport for workers. Public Transport licences issued up to 9th March to vehicles participating in Scheme B of the Supplementary Public Transport Service, number 290, of which 267 were for school buses and the remainder for goods and other vehicles.\n\nThere is no need for the Government to carry out a valuation of SBS assets. A preliminary valuation has been carried out by the firm of professional management consultants for initial allocation of shares, as stated earlier. A full and final valuation will be completed by this firm. Any reputable firm of consultants that produces a false valuation can be prosecuted, besides loss of operating privileges.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, that accounts for part (d) of the hon. Member's Question. Parts (e), (f) and (g) would require no answer, since I have replied to part (c) in the negative. The Government's intention is to get SBS to institutionalise and strengthen its management, and not to set up a corporation to take over the public bus operations or to invite others to participate in this corporation. There is no magic in nationalisation of the bus services. What must be done to improve bus services is to enable a reasonable return on its net assets, professional management not based on family or clan relationships, proper servicing and maintenance of buses, fair wages and facilities for bus workers in return for safe driving and courteous service.\n\nPart (h) of the hon. Member's Question about development of an efficient mass rapid transit system has been answered by me in this House on 4th March in response to a similar question by the hon. Member for Kim Keat. The position is unchanged. I may add that action to improve the public bus service cannot be successful in isolation At the same time, we have to resolve the increasing traffic congestion on our roads. Greater priority has to be given to the needs of public transport, to pedestrians and to preservation and enhancement of our environment. The problem we face is one faced by all big\n\ncities with high-rise buildings. Since the redevelopment of the Central Business District (CBD), the number of people going to work in the CBD has increased more than five times, but the roads have expanded less than two times to cater for the cars, taxis and buses that take people to work at peak hours. A recent count by the Road Transport Working Group showed that about 30,000 cars go into the CBD between 7.30 am, and 9.30 a.m. - just two hours - and of these, one half are motorists commuting to work carrying an average of 1.3 passengers per car.\n\nA Road Transport Action Committee (RTAC) comprising the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministries of National Development, Communications, Home Affairs and Finance (Budget and Development Divisions) was set up in November last year. This Committee is charged with the two-fold task of: -\n\n(a) according high priority to the public bus service; and\n\n(b) adopting various traffic management measures to reduce the present congestion on our streets.\n\nThe following traffic management schemes have been introduced: -\n\n(a) As from January this year, Government and statutory boards have started staggered working hours for their staff, for a trial period of six months. So far, the response from the private sector to appeals by the Finance Ministry to also adopt staggered working hours has been disappointing. The private sector should respond more effectively to help spread peak period traffic and so ease congestion.\n\n(b) The insurance industry has creditably responded to the call from Government to save fuel during the present world oil crises. Car owners participating in car pools would not have their insurance policies invalidated under the present terms of these motor insurance policies. Car pooling will save fuel. More important, it will also ease traffic congestion. In this respect, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Principal of the Methodist Girls' School in Sophia Road is to be congratulated. It was reported in the press\n\nrecently that from 1,000 cars previously used to carry pupils to and from her school daily, she has successfully, through the enthusiastic support of parents, reduced this number to 300 by promoting a car pooling scheme. If one school can reduce the number of cars by 700, or more than two-thirds, 10 schools could reduce the number of private cars on the roads by 7,000 daily through similar schemes. So if employers, trade unions and others in the private sector followed the example of MGS, there would be an immediate easing of traffic congestion during peak periods.\n\n(c) A widespread system of reserved bus lanes which began with Robinson Road and parts of Market and Cecil Streets on 6th February. Those along Stamford and Bras Basah Roads came into operation from 22nd February, and the next would be along Orchard Road, Penang Road, Somerset Road and Orchard Boulevard as from tomorrow, 15th March. By the end of June, more than 20 busy streets in the Central Business District would have reserved bus lanes to accord public buses the priority they deserve in order to move expeditiously and unhindered by other traffic in limited road space. We are also providing more and wider pavements for pedestrians and kerbside bus stands for bus commuters, wherever possible.\n\n(d) Increasing restraints on private cars. As reserved bus lanes come into operation, many existing kerbside parking lots will be abolished. In particular, restrictions would have to be imposed on private cars entering the Central Business District during peak hours. I have mentioned in my reply to the hon. Member for Kim Keat on 4th March that a plan is now being worked out for fringe parking of private cars going into the CBD and commuting in special buses into the CBD. The plan will be published for public discussion and all practical suggestions incorporated before implementation.\n\nFinally, Sir, let me assure the hon. Member that measures are in hand to ensure an adequate public bus service,\n\nsupplemented by other forms of public transport. Further measures are being studied to improve the peak hour congestion in the CBD. A World Bank mission, which was in Singapore recently in connection with the Mass Transit Study project, indicated considerable interest in the work of the Road Transport Action Committee and Bus Services Reorganisation Committee and gave assurance of favourable consideration by the Bank to loan financing of projects undertaken by these two Committees.\n\nEncik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang): Mr Speaker, Sir, first I would like to clarify that the reference to \"other public transportation systems\" in my Question includes only MRT, and excludes goods vehicles, taxis and school buses. I have got several supplementary questions, and I hope I will be given a good deal of time to do them justice, just as much time as the hon. Minister for Communications.\n\nMr Speaker: How many supplementary questions does the Member have?\n\nEncik Abdul Aziz: I have about 10 supplementary questions. There are still other courses left open for the Government to take: first, to maintain the interest of private monopoly and, second, to take over control of the operation of the bus services. Will the Minister for Communications now confirm if any assurance or guarantee had been given to the Singapore Bus Service Limited that it would not be taken over under any circumstances?\n\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin: The answer is a simple no.\n\nEncik Abdul Aziz: Will the Minister say whether the Government will consider taking over the rights and interests of the Singapore Bus Service Limited when the services become worse, or when the services become better? Is the Government stalling for time? And, if so, will a target date be fixed?\n\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin: Sir, it seems that the hon. Member has other questions too. Maybe I should hear them before I give him the answers.\n\nEncik Abdul Aziz: I will then proceed with all my questions. Is profitability of an undertaking a crucial point in determining the Government's attitude? Or is public interest of no concern?\n\nBefore the Minister answers my next set of questions, may I refer him to the statement of the Minister for Finance on 4th March, 1974, in Parliament, and I quote [col. 76]:\n\n`There have been suggestions that the Government nationalise the bus companies and subsidise the commuter.' I have only proposed the nationalisation of the Singapore Bus Service Limited. I quote further from the same speech:\n\n`But what happens when the Government nationalises a company which has not yet got institutionalised management, and corruption on a scale rampant in the former Singapore Traction Company inevitably results? Let us first get management and services improved through tighter supervision from the Ministry of Communications.'\n\nNow comes my set of questions. Can it be implied that it is not against the philosophy of the Government to nationalise the SBS? Can it be implied also that there is a nagging fear that the present SBS management is corrupt, and will it be more corrupt if the Government were to take over, lock, stock and barrel? Will it bring ruination to the bus service? If the Port workers were to behave in this way, it would be treason. Therefore, will the Government take such behaviour on the part of the management of SBS as treason?\n\nMuch productivity and leisure hours of the bus travelling public is wasted. Will the Minister for Communications stop nursing and molly-coddling the SBS? Does he think it imperative that the views of the bus travelling public be sought if an efficient and cheap bus service is to be operated by the State?\n\nMy next question is, if the Government is not willing to take over the rights and interests of the SBS, may I know whether the Government is willing\n\nto establish a corporation, wholly or partly owned by the Government, to compete with the SBS?\n\nWhat is the logical explanation for the Government's decision to spend millions of dollars on the cable car system, which is not a daily necessity, or on the construction of golf courses which are beyond the means of the ordinary working people, when it is not prepared to finance an essential service like the bus service, although it is able to do so? This is beyond reason. We have a lot of reserves.\n\nDoes the Minister believe that the bus service will be ruined to a point where it would be wiser for the Government to leave the management of the bus company to the owners?\n\nDoes the Minister want us to believe that the Government has no financial resources? Where are our reserves? Since the Government was prepared to go to the extent of lending its assistance in getting local as well as international banks and finance companies, and also the Development Bank of Singapore, to bolster the SBS, why does the Government not consider doing so for a statutory corporation? Does the Minister for Communications consider that the SBS, without even a Board of Directors and ruled by personal and clan relationship, has far greater expertise than the Government can command?\n\nI have one last question on the MRT. If MRT is feasible, will it be in the hands of a private monopoly?\n\nMr Speaker: All these supplementary questions asked by the Member for Kallang are incorporated in Oral Questions 3 and 4.\n\nEncik Abdul Aziz: I agree I have given notice of Questions 3 and 4. And I have other supplementary questions on those two Questions.\n\nMr Speaker: But, they have not been answered yet.\n\nEncik Abdul Aziz: I think the Minister for Communications has referred to them. If I am permitted, I will now ask\n\nsupplementary questions on these Questions which I have already given notice.\n\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin: Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is anticipating his Questions 3 and 4. He seems to be very impatient to get on with them. With your permission, Sir, we may as well get on with Questions 3 and 4, and the Member can ask his supplementary questions ad infinitum.\n\nEncik Abdul Aziz: All right. My next supplementary question. We are always reminded that the SBS was formed only on 1st November, 1973. The bus services had been bad before SBS was formed. They are now worse. If something is to be done to improve it, it will at the best fall into a bad state again. How long will it take to improve the services to the satisfaction of the public, I do not know.\n\nMr Speaker: What is your supplementary question?\n\nEncik Abdul Aziz: Why should the operating losses of its predecessor-companies be of any material importance to the public?\n\nMy next supplementary question is this. If the running of public transport service is rather bad business and therefore in order to make good profit the travelling public can only expect poor service, as is the case with the SBS where both service and the supposed losses are bad, will the Minister for Communications be able to say whether the operating losses are true and correct? Before the Minister answers the question, it may interest him to refer to the Government's White Paper on the Reorganisation of the Motor Transport Service of Singapore, (Paper Cmd. 21 of 1970) paragraph 3.7, wherein it is stated:\n\n`The management of some bus companies have noted with delight [the next few words are not so important] that after replacing their old buses (some as old as over. 20 years) with new buses their profits went up appreciably. What is the name of the game, when we are now told that they are operating at a loss?\n\nThe next question is, why is the Minister so concerned with the existence of a private monopoly by nursing the SBS? Why is he most prepared to allow the present state of affairs to continue and to tilt the balance so that the register shows profits? Why prop up an inefficient organisation?\n\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin: Mr Speaker, Sir, it looks as if I have to answer Questions 3 and 4 at the same time, as it should then cover all the points that the Member has raised, whether they be on Questions 2, 3, or 4.\n\nMr Speaker: Yes.\n\nThe following Questions stood on the Order Paper -\n\nSINGAPORE BUS SERVICE LIMITED (Increase of bus fares)\n\n3. Encik Abdul Aziz Karim: To ask the Minister for Communications (a) on what legitimate grounds the Singapore Bus Service (Private) Limited has been allowed to hike bus fares when it has failed to serve the public interest; and (b) if it is fair and reasonable to impose upon the public to financially make up for its operating losses, and to enhance profits and raise the capital requirements of a private monopoly.\n\nPUBLIC BUS SERVICES (Operation by Government)\n\n4. Encik Abdul Aziz Karim: To ask the Minister for Communications to state the capacity and capability of the Government to operate the public bus services on its own or indirectly through a statutory corporation with suitable partners, taking into consideration that our international airlines, international shipping lines, port, telecommunication and other services and concerns are expertly managed.\n\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin: Mr Speaker, Sir, the legal authority for raising fares is in the Road Traffic Act (Chapter 22). The Road Traffic (Taxis and Buses -Maximum Rates of Hire) (Amendment) Order, 1974, published on 9th February in the Government Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 7 of 1974 issued under that Act, authorises the revision effective from 10th February.\n\nThe reasons why the revision was necessary were given at length in my Ministry's Statements of 3rd and 20th February. Replies by the Secretary of the Bus Services Reorganisation Committee to editorials, reports and letters in the Press also detailed the reasons. I am sure Members of the House would not wish to have them repeated here.\n\nWhether the fare revision should have been allowed when the bus service does not meet commuter demands really begs the question. If the old bus fares, which had been in existence for almost three years from April 1971, had continued unchanged, and there had been no interim $25 monthly allowance per worker, and no increase in diesel fuels and other lubricants, spare parts and tyres, Singapore Bus Service Ltd. (SBS) would have had an expected profit in the year ending March this year of $133,000 but losses in the year ending March 1975 and 1976 of $29.7 million and $42.3 million respectively. In these circumstances, it would be difficult to expect the public bus service to improve. No one will throw good money after bad.\n\nThe projections of profit and loss, just quoted, came from professional management consultants, SGV-Goh (Pte) Ltd, who were commissioned by SBS. However, these projections were made in November last year and did not take into account additional cost factors arising later. These cost factors are: -\n\n(a) the increasing fuel oil price which rose last December and has gone up again this month following doubling of the crude oil price in January - SBS's fuel bill will be up this month by 105 per cent as compared to pre-November 1973;\n\n(b) the increasing wage bill which went up in February following implementation of an interim wage supplement of $25 per worker per month and will rise still further in July when the NWC makes its next recommendation - SBS's wage bill, including CPF\n\ncontributions and related items, went up by 18 per cent as compared to pre-November 1973.\n\nNew projections which take account of these additional cost factors and an, annual growth in passenger trips of 4 per cent, as against 5.5 per cent by SGV-Goh (Pte) Ltd indicate a loss to SBS over the 15 months from April 1973 to June 1974 of $17.5 million, if the three-year old fare structure remained unchanged,.\n\nThat the old fares were uneconomic is corroborated by the poor response to the Supplementary Public Transport Service (SPTS). Up to 6th February, in the three weeks during which operators were invited to submit applications, few applications by bus owners and lorry owners were received. On 6th February an announcement was made that the fares chargeable under the SPTS, which were based on the public bus fares structure, would be revised in line with the revision of the public bus fares. Even after this increase, only 189 buses and 134 lorries have joined this supplementary transport scheme.\n\nIs it fair and reasonable that the public should pay to financially sustain the bus company or pay for its capital infrastructure? The answer is that SBS started operations with a paid-up capital of $11 million and net assets of $30 million (i.e. net book value of buses less outstanding hire purchase payments). To get the bus services improved to fair standards to meet the increased passenger load would require net assets of some $90 million. No bus operator can be expected to sink in this capital if they cannot see any hope of even covering costs.\n\nSubsidies to help meet operating costs would not result in the improvement of bus services. Capital investments of $65 million would have to be made. Adult bus commuters are already subsidising school children who travel on concessional 10-cent flat rate to any destination. Indirect subsidies through exemption of diesel fuel tax and other taxes, as has been suggested, would not have any significant effect. Tax on diesel fuel\n\naccounts for only 0.8 per cent of SBS's total operating costs. Other taxes and licence fees make up 10.7 per cent. Together, they only account for 11.5 per cent of the total operating costs. These go towards general revenue to pay for making roads and maintaining them, bus bays and shelters, bus termini, etc. Wear and tear by buses are very heavy on surfaces of roads and termini. For example, after the Singapore Traction Company (STC) packed up in December 1971, the former three bus companies, now known as SBS, were allowed to temporarily garage the SBS buses at the National Stadium car park during the night. When the bus companies stopped garaging their buses there months later, it cost them $123,000 to make up and restore the surface of the car park worn out by the buses.\n\nSir, that completes my answer to Question 3. I now proceed to answer Question 4.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I have stated that there will be no advantage in the Government taking over the public bus services now operated by Singapore Bus Service Ltd (SBS) which has been in operation for only four months. SBS has shown itself willing to meet the targets and take such measures as my Ministry and the Bus Services Reorganisation Committee (BSRC) have asked. It should be given time to settle down, tighten management, improve maintenance and increase bus services.\n\nIn answer to the question as posed by the hon. Member, may I point out that Singapore Airlines (SIA) is not a new airline but has developed its management and organisation over one quarter of a century. The Government has been associated directly with its management in the course of this development for many years. Our port has a history of more than one century; in fact, 150 years. Telecommunications in. Singapore goes back into the last century. The Government has been involved in the management of these for many years, and built up on inherited organisations like the Oriental Telephone and Electric Company, Cable and\n\nWireless Ltd, etc. In the case of shipping, there is local talent with the knowledge and experience to operate a national shipping line. Shipping is as old as the history of Singapore. There are numerous shipping companies in Singapore where experience in operating a major international shipping line can be obtained.\n\nUnfortunately the position with the public bus services is different. We now have only one company, namely SBS, operating the public bus services with a fleet of 2,000 buses. All the local talent with experience in operating public bus services is in SBS. Prior to November 1973, there were three bus companies. None of them operated more than 1,000 buses. Less than three years before that, there were 11 companies, including the former Singapore Traction Company (STC). Then, none of them was operating more than 170 buses, except for the STC which was operating about 500 buses.\n\nIf Government were to take over the public bus operations, it would have to use the present management of SBS. To do this effectively would be a problem with the existing manpower resources of the Government. No government officer has had experience of operating a bus company. The nearest to such a task is the officer in charge of the Singapore Armed Forces, Transport Division, and that took a great deal of effort to build up from scratch.\n\nThe Government is conscious of the responsibility to ensure that SBS, the sole operator of public bus services, must be properly managed and must provide adequate essential service. But it cannot be expected to do this when it is operating at a loss. Even before SBS began operations on 1st November, 1973, I established the Bus Services Reorganisation Committee (BSRC). The BSRC, under my personal supervision, receives daily returns from SBS on the bus operations - how many buses were operating for the day, how many buses broke down, how many are in the workshop, how much fare was\n\ncollected, etc. In addition, monthly reports on the bus operations, as well as monthly financial statements, are submitted by SBS. As from November last year, SBS is also required to send in certified quarterly financial reports. All these returns and reports are analysed and studied. Officers of the Registry of Vehicles cross check by making personal visits to the depots from time to time.\n\nThe purpose of all this is not only to monitor the progress of SBS and set the targets for its management to attain, but also to ensure that the revenue it collects is properly spent. There is a limit to the return on its net assets in buses, which shareholders in SBS may earn. Supervision and scrutiny are necessary to ensure that revenue and expenditure are properly accounted for, and that there is no wasteful expenditure, no corruption, no dishonesty. The Government cannot allow the management of the bus company any fare revisions that would go into wasteful or unjustified expenditure through inefficient management or corrupt practices. The management of SBS would be improved and made organisationally efficient. The BSRC and I intend to see that it will stay so.\n\nMeantime, this supervision is giving a team of Government officers experience in detecting flaws in the running of a public bus operation of the scale of SBS. This body of supervisory men will develop the expertise to help ensure that public transport will be run efficiently, not at a loss, nor allowed to exploit the public.\n\nFor the next three years, the job is for the SBS to get at least 1,000 new buses on the roads, repair the 400 buses that are now immobilised, keep all under regular maintenance, improve driving standards for safety of passengers and others on the roads, more courtesy and consideration by conductors. The best way to achieve this is through the BSRC. Nationalisation will create more problems than we have the capacity at present to solve.\n\nMr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir): Mr Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question\n\nis connected with Question No. 2, and I did not have the opportunity to raise it then. Does the Minister know that there is some talk to the effect that the only thing wrong with the public transport system in Singapore is that one exists? I disagree, and in disagreeing I would humbly ask the Minister whether he has plans to improve the public transport system by introducing some commuter-discipline. At the present moment, at bus stops it is the law of the jungle, and not first come first served.\n\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin: Sir, I fully agree with the Member that there should be general improvement all round - buses, bus commuters and the public.\n\nEncik Abdul Aziz: Mr Speaker, Sir, must we carry the SBS as a passenger?\n\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin: Sir, the name SBS means that they carry passengers.\n\nThe following Questions stood on the Order Paper --\n\n5. Mr J. F. Conceicao: To ask the Minister for Health and Home Affairs how action is taken against vehicles displaying non-Singapore licence plates which are found breaking traffic regulations; and what course of action is taken when a report from a member of the public is received against such vehicles.\n\n6.

Conceicao: To ask the Minister for Finance what sort of joint training schemes were conducted through joint industrial training centres in 1973; what further activities are being planned; how responsibility for those schemes is distributed between the Government and the private sector; if there is any intention to modify the basis of co-operation; and in what ways his Ministry supports other forms of industrial training.\n\n3.29 p.m.\n\nMr Speaker: Mr Conceicao, I am afraid there is no time for you to ask your three Questions. Would you agree to have written answers instead, or would you prefer to postpone them to another day?\n\nMr J. F. Conceicao (Katong): Sir, I have been advised by the other Members to have the Questions answered on another day.

The breakdown of officers is as follows: -\n 264 officers from Division I\n\n415 officers from Division II\n\n957 officers from Division III\n\n66 officers from Division IV\n\n148 officers from statutory boards\n\n-----\n\n1,850\n\n=====\n\nThe breakdown of man-hours involved is as follows: -\n 357 hours - 8.3% - Division I\n\n429 hours - 9.9% - Divisions 1/11\n\n1,134 hours - 26.3% - Division II\n\n55 hours - 1.3% -Divisions 11/Ill\n\n1,970 hours - 45.8% - Division III\n\n172 hours - 4 % - Divisions Ill/N\n\n188 hours - 4.4% -Division IV\n\n-----\n\n4,305\n\n=====\n\nIn addition, the Institute also sponsored a total of 241 officers to courses at the Outward Bound School and National Youth Leadership Institute for Divisions I to III officers.\n\nThe types of courses conducted by the Institute under its various programmes in 1973 were:-\n Level\n\n1 Induction Courses\n\n- for Administrative Officers Division I\n\n- for Executive Officers Division II\n\nLevel\n\n1 Induction Courses (cont.)\n\n- for Defence Executive Officers Division II\n\n- for Clerical Assistants Division III\n\n2 Management Courses\n\n- Introduction to Quantitative Division I\n\nMethods in Management\n\n- General Management Division I\n\n- Management by Objectives Division I\n\n- Intermediate Admin Officers Division I\n\n- Junior Management Division II\n\n3 Specialised and Vocational Courses\n\n- Interpretation of Financial\n\nStatements Division I\n\n- Introduction to Computers Division I\n\n- Faster Reading Division I/II\n\n- Forms Control and Design Division II\n\n- Financial Officers Division II\n\n- Personal Assistants Division II\n\n- Metrication Divisions II/III\n\n- Courtesy and Telephone\n\nEtiquette Division III/IV\n\n- Audio-typing Division IV\n\n4 Language Courses\n\n- Classes for officers educated\n\nin non-English streams Division II\n\n- Classes in various local\n\nlanguages/dialects for\n\nStudent Interpreters/\n\nTranslators Division III\n\nGOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS: 2. Mr J. F. Conceicao asked the Minister for Education what was, for the year 1973, the average cost per student borne by the Government in relation to its subventions for the following educational institutions (i) the University of Singapore; (ii) the Nanyang University; (iii) the Singapore Polytechnic; (iv) the Ngee Ann Technical College; (v) the Industrial Training Board; and (vi) the Institute of Education.\n\nDr Lee Chiaw Meng: The average cost per student borne by the Government in 1973 in relation to the subvention for each of the following educational institutions is as follows: -\n Average cost per student\n\nInstitution/Board for 1973\n\nUniversity of Singapore. ... $3,928\n\nNanyang University ... $2,222\n\nSingapore Polytechnic ... $1,292\n\nNgee Ann Technical College ... $ 816\n\nIndustrial Training Board ... $1,760\n\nInstitute of Education ... $2,570(1972/1973)\n\nHowever, Government subsidy varies from course to course. For example, in the University of Singapore, it ranges from around $2,000 per annum for Accountancy and Business Administration students to $10,000 for medical students. The low figure for the Ngee Ann Technical College is due to the fact that the College receives substantial contribution from Ngee Ann Kongsi, and therefore less subsidy is extended to it by Government as compared with the other educational institutions.", "url": "https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/#/report?sittingdate=14-03-1974"}
