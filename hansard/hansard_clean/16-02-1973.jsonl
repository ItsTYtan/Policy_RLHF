Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj asked the Minister for Communications what measures the Government is taking against old buses with smoky exhausts and noisy engines which are still on the roads.\n\nThe Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng) (for the Minister for Communications): Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem o old buses with smoky exhausts and noisy engines is being tackled in several ways.\n\nThe most effective is the replacement programme as set out in the White Paper on Reorganisation of the Motor Transport Service of Singapore (Command Paper 21 of 1970). Under this replacement programme the numbers to be replaced are:\n Year 1970/71 1971/72 1972/73 Total\n\n(July to June)\n\nReplacement 50 100 150 300\n\nBuses are recommended for replacement on attaining the age of 17 years. Since the reorganisation, 231 buses have been replaced, of which 64 were under 17 years.\n\nAt the same time, all buses are subject to half yearly inspections at the ROV Mechanical Inspection Centre. Those\n\nfound to emit excessive smoke and noise are required to have these faults rectified.\n\nSpot checks on the road are also made on buses for excessive smoke or noise. In addition, actions are taken based on complaints from the public against specific buses.\n\nThese measures have resulted in a total of 3,018 buses being \"booked\" for smoky exhausts during 1971. During 1972 (Jan-Dec), 2,955 buses were \"booked\" for the same offence.\n\nAs for buses with noisy engines, some discretion has to be exercised in dealing with this problem. Most of the noisy buses come from the lot of 400-odd former STC buses taken over by the three bus companies following the collapse of the Singapore Traction Company. These are being phased out in a manner that will not cause a sudden shortage of buses or impose a sudden financial burden on the bus companies.\n\nThe Member for Geylang Serai may wish to note that, in the White Paper tabled on 21st July, 1970, the total number of public buses on the roads as at 30th April, 1970 is given as 1,390. However, as at 31st January, 1973, we have 2,079 public buses. In time, all the former STC buses as well as the other old buses would be phased out. The bus companies are themselves aware that many of their old buses are costly to operate and maintain.\n\nPILGRIMAGE TO MECCA BY AIR (Improvement of flight system)\n\n2. Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi asked the Minister for Communications, in view of the increased number of persons going on pilgrimage to Mecca by special chartered flights, if he will consider improving the system for departure and arrival of such flights.\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng (for the Minister for Communications): Mr Speaker, Sir, prior to 1971, there were very few special pilgrimage flights. Most pilgrims went and returned by ship. With the advent of cheap charter flights, special\n\npilgrimage flights have increased. There were 12 such flights from Singapore in 1971, and 13 in 1972. During 1971, there were 1,103 passengers by special pilgrimage flights arriving and 827 departing. For 1972, there were 939 of such arriving passengers and 492 departing.\n\nThe total number of passengers by special pilgrimage flights arriving and departing is only about 2 per cent of the total number of passengers passing through the Singapore Airport on a single day. For a normal day in 1972, about 9,000 passengers would be passing through the Singapore Airport.\n\nFor pilgrimage flights, Singapore Airlines has made special provisions to begin checking in passengers as early as three to four hours before each flight, compared to some one to two hours for other flights. Other departure and arrival procedures at the Singapore International Airport have also been improved for all incoming and outgoing flights, including pilgrimage charter flights.\n\nThere is some congestion at the Airport terminal building before the departure or arrival of a special pilgrimage flight. But this is caused by the many well-wishers of the pilgrims. These well-wishers begin to assemble at the terminal building from as early as five to six hours before the departure or arrival of a special pilgrimage flight. The present terminal building was not designed to cater for such large crowds of well-wishers over such long periods of time. However, when the present plans for expansion of the Airport are completed, the Airport terminal buildings should be well able to cope with such capacity crowds.\n\nTuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)(In Malay): Sir, can the Minister of State for Communications tell us whether the present plans for expansion have been carried out? If so, when can the expansion be expected to be completed?\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng: Expansion work is expected to be completed sometime in 1976.\n\nJALAN UBI (Making up of portion between Pan Island Expressway and Airport Road)\n\n3. Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi asked the Minister for Law and National Development when that portion of Jalan Ubi from the Pan Island Expressway to Airport Road will be made up similar to the other portion between the Expressway and Changi Road.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Works Department will widen and improve that portion of Jalan Ubi between the Pan-Island Expressway and Airport Road sometime in the middle of this year. The road will be widened to have a carriageway of about 22 feet, and the total cost will be in the region of $100,000.\n\nTuan Haji Mohd. Ariff(In Malay): Sir, can the Minister expedite the development of the road, in view of the present bad state of the road?\n\nMr Barker: Sir, roads take time to build. We will do our best to expedite it. But I do not think the time I gave can be shortened, as it will take at least six months to a year for the completion of the job.\n\nTuan Haji Mohd. Ariff(In Malay): Sir, if my memory serves me right, I brought this question up last year.\n\nMr Barker: Sir, it is true that the Member raised this question sometime last year. But this portion of the road does not go through Kampong Kembangan constituency alone. There are other M.P.s involved and, in fact, one of them asked me to go slow.\n\nTuan Haji Mohd. Ariff(In Malay): Sir, can the Minister tell the House which Member of Parliament has asked him to go slow?\n\nMr Barker: It is not necessary to name the Member of Parliament, but the fact is that one did.\n\nDANGERS OF SPEEDING AND SPILLAGE BY LORRIES (Measures to minimise)\n\n4. Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj asked the Minister for Health and Home Affairs what measures are being taken to minimise danger to road users from spillage on the roads from lorries carrying sand, stones, earth, etc., and from such lorries being driven at speeds in excess of the prescribed speed limits.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin): Mr Speaker, Sir, drivers of lorries which spill sand, stones, earth, etc. On public roads are ticketted under the Environmental Public Health Act. Further, if the spillage is on a small scale, it is cleaned up by labourers of the Environmental Health Division. However, if it is extensive, the contractor is required to clean it up, or the Environmental Health Division will do so and bill him.\n\nIn some cases, water-waggons are also deployed for emergency flushing of spillage on public roads. Where the littering is expected to be protracted, the contractor is required to provide his own flushing facilities to the satisfaction of the Environmental Health Division.\n\nIf the spillage damages the road, the haulage contractor is required to repair the road to the satisfaction of the PWD or the PWD will do so and bill him.\n\nThe Traffic Police takes a serious view of such lorries violating traffic rules. Those who drive the lorries in excess of the prescribed speed limits are fined or prosecuted. A Selective Enforcement Squad has also been formed within the Mobile Squad of the Traffic Police Division to deal with such offenders.\n\nFor the period 1-1-72 to 31-12-72, 502 cases of spillage by lorries on roads and 3,167 cases of speeding by lorries were reported to the Police and appropriate action taken against them.\n\nBUS ACCIDENTS (Particulars)\n\n5. Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi asked the Minister for Health and Home Affairs (a) how many serious omnibus accidents occurred between 1st May, 1971, and the latest convenient date, giving breakdown figures in respect of each bus company; and (b) how many persons were killed in those accidents.\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of serious accidents (including fatal accidents) between 1-5-71 and 31-10-72 involving omnibuses was 413. The breakdown of this figure is as follows:- Amalgamated Bus Company Ltd. 58\n\nUnited Bus Company (Pte.) Ltd 123\n\nAssociated Bus Service Ltd. 232\n\n---\n\n413\n\n===\n\nAs regards the second part of the question, a total of 67 persons were killed in these accidents.\n\nMr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah): Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the seriousness of these accidents, we would like to know what steps have been taken by the authorities to remedy the situation?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Traffic Police has formed a Selective Enforcement Squad within the Mobile Squad to take action against drivers of public service vehicles found speeding or driving in a dangerous or reckless manner. In addition to Court prosecution or fines, the Traffic Police also recommends to the Registrar of Vehicles to suspend the driving licences of bus drivers in serious cases.\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Sir, this practice of the Mobile Squad arresting the drivers and so on has been in existence from time immemorial.\n\nMr Speaker: Mr Ho, are you asking a supplementary question, or are you entering into a debate on this?\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Sir, what I am saying is that, in spite of the action taken by the Mobile Squad, I do not see any reduction in the number of accidents. Can the authorities, therefore, do something more than that?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already answered the question. I said that the Traffic Police has formed a Selective Enforcement Squad within the Mobile Squad to take action. Perhaps the Member for Bras Basah did not comprehend the answer. That was not done before.\n\nREVISION OF SALARIES AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE FOR GOVERNMENT SENIOR OFFICERS (Statement by the Minister for Finance)\n\n2.46 p.m.\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Treasury has for some time been reviewing the various schemes of Government service and making changes, where desirable, to them. Members may recall, for example, the restructuring of Teachers' salary scales, and the revision of salaries for Junior Police Officers, Technical Officers, Nurses and Midwives and daily-rated employees. In this Statement, however, my purpose is to consider the terms and conditions of service of Division I, especially Administrative and Professional, Officers constituting the top echelons of the civil service.\n\nThese officers form about 2 per cent only of the Government Service but make the most vital and important contribution as they give administrative and professional leadership and direction to the whole service. Their administrative and professional skills, so valuable to Government, would be equally useful to the private sector, which can, and often do attract them by the offer of rewards well in excess of what the public sector at present pays. It is not expected that we can completely prevent losses to the private sector, even with the revisions we are proposing. But it is essential, if we are\n\nnot to strain unduly the great loyalty and dedication to the Service which most of our top civil servants have shown, that their salaries and conditions of service should he roughly equated to those in the private sector. The Government should seek to be regarded, taking the monetary with other non-financial rewards which are offered, as equally good or even better employers.\n\nWhile I propose to confine my remarks in this Statement to revisions proposed for the Government sector, I recognise that they will be equally pertinent to some employers in the public sector who also employ administrative and professional officers. Where their qualifications and the nature of their work are comparable, the terms and conditions of service of their Government counterparts are relevant. To the extent that such Statutory Boards and Universities depend upon Government financing, my Budget and Establishment Division, in consultation with these public sector bodies, will examine any necessary revisions for such professional and administrative officers so that they may be correlated with those of the Government. But it is necessary to emphasise that the Government revisions may not be relevant or appropriate to all administrative and professional officers in the public sector as the nature and responsibilities of such officers and their conditions of service may be quite different from those of the Government officers.\n\nRevisions of salaries have obvious financial implications which have had to be carefully considered in relation to Singapore's economic situation and its ability to pay enhanced salaries not only to officers in Superscale posts but also to officers in the whole of the public sector. Pending such consideration, the payment of a non-pensionable annual allowance equivalent to one month's salary (a sort of 13th month payment) as a regular annual feature was an interim measure which has not, however, rendered the problem of restructuring the top civil service any less urgent.\n\nIn view of Singapore's continuing economic growth, it is now proposed to make revisions with effect from 1st March, 1973 as in the Table* (*See Appendix, cols 435-6.) I have distributed.\n\nAppendix to Statement on Revision of Salaries of Senior Appointments in the Public Service (Cols. 392-401) (0435-0436)\n\nThe following remarks may be of value in considering the changes proposed in the Table. First, with regard to the Timescale Division I Administrative and Professional Officers, it is generally recognised that the first three years of the salary scale for Division I Officers are adequate for the period during which officers are still learning and undergoing training. The inadequacy often arises after three to five years when there may be difficulty in retaining some of the more promising officers who are attracted to seemingly greener pastures in the private sector. We have tried to find an answer to this problem in more rapid and more frequent promotions to higher segments of the salary scale based on merit and not necessarily on vacancies and these are now regularly being done by the Public Service Commission. For example, the Public Service Commission has only this week concluded a promotion exercise in the administrative service in which 11 Assistant Secretaries were promoted to the grade of Principal Assistant Secretary and 16 Administrative Assistants were promoted to the grade of Assistant Secretary with an additional three promoted to Principal Assistant Secretary on trial and seven promoted to Assistant Secretary on trial for one year. In addition to these more frequent promotions for the Division I Officers, it is proposed to introduce a scheme of accelerated increments for merit. This will enable us to reward by more than the normal one increment annually, but subject to a maximum of four increments, deserving officers who either are not yet ready to be promoted to the next grade or for other organisational reasons cannot be so promoted.\n\nThis Merit Increment Scheme has been accepted by the Public Service Commission and the Legal Service Commission, and will be implemented\n\nthis year. The Scheme will then apply not only to Timescale officers in the Administrative Service but also to professional officers like doctors, lawyers, architects and engineers. The assessment of the merit of individual officers under the Scheme will be carried out by a Committee of relevant Permanent Secretaries who will be appointed by, and will make their recommendations to the Public Service Commission (or the Legal Service Commission, as the case may be). Admittedly, such assessment of merit will not be an easy task but the Committee of Permanent Secretaries will have access to all the confidential dossiers of the officers and a specially prepared report by the Head of Department of the officers concerned. This Scheme is not a novel one as it has been tried out in other public services and it has also been adopted by some companies in the private sector.\n\nWith regard to the Upper Timescale Officers, that is, officers on the salary scale $1,700x50-1,850, it is proposed to revise their salary scale to $1,700x 100-2,000. There are really two changes to this scale:\n\n(i) it extends the upper limit from $1,850 to $2,000 and\n\n(ii) it increases the yearly increment from the existing $50 per annum to $100 per annum.\n\nThe Upper Timescale grade is a stepping stone to the Superscale grades and the present revision bringing the maximum to $2,000 will ensure that the Upper Timescale Officers will reach a higher maximum than the Timescale Officers on the salary scale $900x50-l,000/1,050x50-l,400/1,450x50-1,850. A Timescale Officer through the passage of time only will no longer reach the same salary as an Upper Timescale Officer.\n\nWe now come to the first of the Superscale grades, that is, Superscale G. There are Superscale G officers in the Government service ranging from Assistant Directors of Education and Deputy Chief Planner, Planning Department, to Radiologists. The salary of the\n\nSuperscale G Officers is to be revised from $l,920 to $2,500, an increase of $580 per month.\n\nNext in the Superscale structure is Superscale Grade F which at present is at a salary of $2,020. Comparatively, there are only a small number of Superscale F Officers in the Government service and these comprise the Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police, the Director of Prisons and the Director of National Library amongst others. The responsibility of these officers is generally a shade higher than the Superscale G Officers. It is proposed to revise their salary to $2,750, an increase of $730 per month over the present salary.\n\nFurther up the ladder is Superscale Grade E which includes officers like the Assistant Directors of Public Works, the Commissioner of Lands and Deputy Secretaries of Ministries. The salary of these Superscale Grade E Officers will be revised from $2,070 to $3,000, an increase of $930 per month.\n\nNext are Superscale D Officers. There are only a small number of officers in this grade amongst whom are the Accountant-General, the Auditor-General, Deputy Directors of Medical Services, the Deputy Director of Public Works, the Director of Civil Aviation, the Registrar of the High Court and the Senior District Judge. At present, these officers are drawing a salary of $2,170 and it is proposed to revise their salaries to $3,500 per month. In addition, it is also proposed to bring this grade of officers within the scheme whereby they will be entitled to the use of a car paid for by the Government but maintained by the officers themselves.\n\nWe now come to the Superscale C grade. This is the grade for most of the Permanent Secretaries and for four other officers, the Solicitor-General, the Commissioner of Police, the Director of Public Works and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. In recognition of the heavy responsibilities that these officers shoulder as administrative Heads of the Ministries, the present\n\nsalary of $2,350 per month will be revised to $4,500. In addition, they will continue to be entitled to the use of a car paid for by Government. Special arrangements of an official car with driver maintained by Government are made for the Commissioner of Police because of his position as head of a disciplined force.\n\nNext higher in grade is Superscale B, which includes other Permanent Secretaries, Puisne Judges and the President of the Industrial Arbitration Court. In view of the nature of their duties and the positions they occupy, the salary of this grade of officers presently at $2,700 will be revised to $5,500 per month. They are, of course, also entitled to the use of a car. In addition to the car that would be provided by Government, the Judges will continue to enjoy perquisites such as a Government house at the usual Government subsidised rental but fully maintained by Government.\n\nIt is proposed to create an additional grade called Superscale B1 to be attached to the most senior of the Puisne Judges in recognition of his special position. This salary will he revised to $6,000 per month.\n\nAt the top of the hierarchy is Super-scale A. There are only three full-time civil servants on this grade - two Permanent Secretaries and the Attorney-General, in addition to the Chairman. Public Service Commission, and for the purposes of grading only, the Honour-able Speaker of this House. It is indeed difficult to assess, in monetary terms, the value of these officers but it is now proposed that the salary of these officers, who are presently at $3,000 per month, be revised to $6,500 per month. Special arrangements are intended for the Speaker since he officiates part-time, but he will continue to be entitled to the official residence (with servants) and an official car, as at present.\n\nThen, we have to consider the position of the Chief Justice. He will be graded as Superscale Al, with a salary of $7,500. The Chief Justice will, in addition, continue to enjoy all the\n\nother terms of office which he presently enjoys, including an official car with driver and an official residence maintained at Government expense, together with a number of household servants to help to upkeep the residence.\n\nHaving dealt generally with the various Superscale gradings and the salaries and other terms appropriate to each, I should like to say a word about cur medical services officers. Many of them are in specialist grades, either in the G or E Superscales. At one time, it was the practice for these specialists (both medical and professional) to be allowed to retain part of the consultation fees from private patients or from undertaking outside consultancy work. This practice, however, resulted in malpractices or conduct unbecoming to the specialist whose attitude towards patients tended to be related to their ability to pay fees. Also, essential medical specialities, such as pathology and radiology, where the possibilities of fees earning were greatly inferior, tended to be increasingly less favoured for specialisation by the bright young medical officer. In 1958, this practice was abolished and replaced by fixed Specialist Allowances for Superscale Medical Officers at varying rates. These rates were revised in 1969 to $100 per month, $150 and $500 per month for Medical Officer, Senior Registrar and Superscale G respectively, and $750 per month for Superscale E and above. However, over the last two years, there has been increasing pressure for the re-introduction of some scheme in which consultant fees would be shared by the consultant specialist. My colleagues in the Cabinet and I do not favour a system which experience has so clearly shown to be readily subject to abuses. At the same time, I realise that if we are to retain our best specialists, we must recognise the value of their contributions in some tangible way. For this purpose, we should promote a few of our outstanding specialists to Superscale D. This will not only mean an immediate increase in salary of $1,430 per month for promotion from the E salary to the proposed Superscale D salary, but also carry the\n\nperquisite I have already mentioned of a Mercedes Benz car provided as to its capital cost at Government expense.\n\nAdditionally, if need be, I am prepared to agree that the fixed Specialist Allowance for doctors should be increased beyond the present limit of $750 up to $1,250 per month for specified individual outstanding officers.\n\nNext, because of the great interest which has been generated, it would seem especially among doctors, it may be appropriate if I refer at this stage to the scheme for reduced vacation and medical leave which has been introduced with effect from 1-1-73 for all Government Officers other than those in the teaching service.\n\nCivil servants under the previous leave scheme were eligible for the following rates of vacation leave:- Completed service\n\nin a particular Days per calendar year\n\nDivision\n\nDiv Div Div Div\n\nI II III IV\n\nLess than 10 years' 33 28 24 21\n\nservice\n\n10 years' service 39 33 28 24\n\nor more\n\nBecause of the generous leave scheme, coupled with the general shortage of staff over the years, many officers had not been able to take their full leave, and as a result, have accumulated considerable leave to their credit.\n\nIn addition to vacation leave, civil servants under the previous regulations were eligible for sick leave on full pay up to 90 days per year whether they are hospitalised or not.\n\nHaving regard to the leave usually allowed by the private sector, leave eligibility for all public officers, regardless of divisional status, has been revised as follows:-\n\nLess than 10 years' service - 14 working days a year.\n\n10 years' service or more - 21 working days a year.\n\nAll provisions for deferred leave would be abolished. However, accumulation of leave up to one year's eligibility may be allowed to be carried forward to the following year.\n\nMedical leave on full pay has been revised to 30 days per year if no hospitalisation is necessary but may be extended to 60 days if hospitalisation is recommended by the medical authorities. This revised leave scheme has been accepted in principle by the staff unions representing the public service.\n\nTo compensate for the reduction in vacation and medical leave, the difference between the employee's previous and new leave eligibility will be commuted into pay. The mode and the exact formula of such compensation is now under examination with the staff unions.\n\nIt should, however, be pointed out that all serving officers on the permanent establishment have an option to either accept the new leave scheme with compensatory payment or retain the previous leave scheme. Furthermore, this principle of option will also be extended to new recruits into the service.\n\nFor those officers who consider the reduced vacation leave insufficient, I should like to add that in future, no-pay leave to make up leave to their previous leave eligibility will be liberally granted. Officers who feel the need for extra leave will therefore be able to use the monetary compensation paid in lieu of leave to offset the loss of pay during such leave.\n\nFinally, I should like to inform members that apart from these salary revisions the Government will adopt the agreed general guidelines of the National Wages Council for salary increases every year. For administrative convenience, it is Government's intention to pay these increases in the form of supplementary allowances at the rate recommended by the National Wages Council. At the end of every four to five years the Government will undertake a full scale revision of salary scales, consolidating in the process such supplementary allowances into the basic salaries.\n\nSuch a revision of salary scales after four to five years will enable Government to review wages and salaries in the public sector and make adjustments to keep broadly in parity with private sector wages and salaries.\n\nIn this way, our promising young officers can be certain when electing for a Government career, that in the medium and longer run, they will never lose out to their contemporaries in the private sector. Competent and effective administration can be assured only if the civil service maintains its quality and integrity, with an able leadership at the top of the administrative pyramid, supported by a constant intake of young officers of promise and some of the ablest of whom will stay and grow in the service in the full knowledge that their climb to the top will be more satisfying and equally rewarding as if they had opted for the private sector.\n\n3.12 p.m.\n\nMr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Finance two questions regarding the salary increases for senior officers. In this Chinese New Year season, this is good news. These are substantial increases for senior officers, particularly the Superscale officers. It is my hope, however, that with these increases their efficiency will also increase for the betterment of the country.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister whether he is prepared to consider raising the salaries of Divisions II, III and IV employees, or whether there will be any kind of adjustment in their salaries so as to ensure that their livelihood will be improved accordingly. I would also like to know how much expenditure will be incurred for these proposed increases in salaries.\n\nMr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein): Mr Speaker, Sir, before I put my questions to the Minister for Finance, I would like to refer him to one point that he has mentioned in his Ministerial Statement. He has made reference to the\n\nrecent revision of the teachers' salaries, thereby giving the impression that the teachers had a wage increase recently. I wish to correct that wrong impression because in the recent revision there was no immediate increase in salaries for teachers. There is no comparison between the salary revision for the teachers and this current salary revision for the upper echelon of the civil service.\n\nMy question is similar to that of the Member for Sembawang, and that is, whether the Government is contemplating an immediate salary revision for the other echelons of the civil service. With the booming economy and an accelerated rate of industrial expansion, attractive job opportunities are thus increased considerably with the result that there is a strong competition to attract both the brains as well as brawns not only within the private sector itself but also between the private sector and the public sector. This problem of retaining and attracting the best in the public service is not only confined to the upper echelons of the public service but is also felt throughout the other rungs of the public service hierarchy.\n\nSir, my question is whether consideration will be given to the need for a revision of salaries of the other echelons of the public service not mentioned in today's Ministerial Statement, with a view to ensuring an efficient and able public service in the best interests of the efficient Government of Singapore.\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the booming economy and the affluence that we are experiencing now, we are faced with a certain degree of inflation at the present moment. Therefore, I would suggest that rather than go on increasing the workers' salary, the Minister for Finance should look into ways and means to reduce the cost of living.\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I should like to make it clear that this particular revision of salaries for the top echelon is a revision which is intended to maintain the rapid rate of growth of the Singapore economy. I have suggested that these\n\nofficers are valuable not only to Government but to the private sector, and that there is some fear that they may be lost to the private sector unless the salaries of these top administrative and professional officers are raised sufficiently to be regarded as on a parity with what they can obtain in the private sector. The cost of this particular revision would be of the order of $4 million a year. I have not worked out the exact figures because some of the officers are Timescale officers and the merit allowances which might be given under this scheme cannot obviously be anticipated.\n\nWith regard to the point whether I am proposing to review Divisions II, III and IV salary scales, my Statement says that we have been doing a restructuring of salary scales for those sectors. The question of wage increases had not really been considered in relation to the restructuring of salary scales. I think that would be a matter for consideration in relation to the wage increases proposed by the National Wages Council which will, as I have mentioned in my Statement, apply equally to all Government officers. I have stated that we are prepared to adopt the recommendations and guidelines of the National Wages Council.\n\nAs far as cost of living is concerned, I have made it quite clear that this revision is to promote the very rapid rate of economic growth. I would also say that these are minimal increases costing about $4 million a year, which will not affect our cost of living.

CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT) (PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL FOR MINORITY RIGHTS) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.22 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nIt is the purpose of this Bill to make the necessary amendments to Part IVA of the Constitution of Singapore so as to enable the Presidential Council hereafter to be concerned only with minority rights and not with fundamental liberties. The Council will accordingly be re-styled the \"Presidential Council for Minority Rights\". Although Part IVA as a whole has been repealed and re-enacted to make for easier reading, it is substantially the same as the existing Part IVA except for the changes which I shall now mention.\n\nArticle 81J under clause 2 of the Bill now reads:\n\n`It shall be the particular function of the Council to draw attention to any Bill or to any subsidiary legislation if that Bill or subsidiary legislation is in the opinion of the Council a differentiating measure.'\n\nThis Article differs from the present Article 8li in that the words \"or otherwise inconsistent with the fundamental liberties of the subject\" at the end of that Article have been omitted. This phrase has, in fact, been deleted throughout Part JVA, while at Article 81A the definition of \"inconsistent with the fundamental liberties of the subject\" has also been excised. The omission of this phrase from the Bill means that the Presidential Council for Minority Rights will be concerned only with drawing attention to \"differentiating measures\" in any legislation, principal or subsidiary, that is, measures which are disadvantageous to persons of any racial or religious community. Upon the coming into operation of the Act, therefore, it will not be part of the Council's functions to draw attention to inconsistencies with the fundamental liberties of the subject as set out in Part II of the Constitution of Malaysia which applies to Singapore.\n\nThese amendments are being made as the Presidential Council itself over the last two years has indicated that it wishes its principal function to be the examination of legislation with a view to ascertaining whether any provisions therein may be discriminatory against racial or religious communities. In the annual report of the Presidential Council for the twelve months ending on 30th April, 1971, the Council urges at paragraph 9 thereof, and I quote:\n\n`In the light of the topics that have been raised by members and discussed during our meetings, we are of the view that the Council can best serve the multi-racial multi-religious peoples of Singapore if the Council is required under the Constitution to devote its principal attention to considering whether or not any proposed legislation, including subsidiary legislation, in its opinion \"is, or is likely in its practical application to be, disadvantageous to persons of any racial or religious community and not equally disadvantageous to persons of other such communities, either directly by prejudicing persons of that community or indirectly by giving advantage to persons of another community\". In other words, [the report continues] we recommend that this Council's principal function should be to examine\n\nlegislation with a view to \"preventing\" Parliament inadvertently passing laws which discriminate against racial or religious minorities in Singapore.'\n\nAgain, in the Presidential Council's annual report for the following year, 1971-72, the Council, after stating that it had in its previous annual report suggested the modification of its functions, which I have just quoted, observed that, in the absence of any statutory amendment to the Council's functions, the Council continued to exercise the functions originally entrusted to it under the Constitution.\n\nIt will therefore he seen, Sir, that it is in accordance with the wishes of the Presidential Council itself that these amendments are being made today.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe house immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr E. W. Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\n3.36 p.m.\n\nClause 1 -\n\nThe Chairman: There is a note, in page 1, line 4, that the citation date has to be altered from \"1972\" to \"1973\". This will be done.\n\nClause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClause 2 -\n\nMr Barker: Sir, I beg to move,\n\n(1) In page 3, line 13, after \"(b)\", to insert \"not more than\".\n\n(2) In page 3, line 15, after \"(c)\" to insert \"not more than\".\n\n(3) In page 9, line 6, to leave out \"ten\" and insert \"eight\".\n\nSir, the first and second amendments relate to the composition of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights which, as in the case of the present Presidential Council, consists of the\n\nChairman, 10 permanent members appointed for life and 10 other members appointed for a period of three years. However, the quota for the permanent and the temporary members has never been filled in full.\n\nWith regard to the permanent members, as was pointed out by the then President in a speech at the time of the presentation of the instrument of appointment on the 2nd of May, 1970, it is the intention of Government to leave at least three of the permanent seats vacant so that any successor government can include some of the senior Ministers in the Council. At the present moment, there are only five permanent members, one having resigned, and eight temporary members. It would, therefore, be more appropriate for the expression \"not more than\" to be inserted at paragraphs (b) and (c) of Article 81(B).-(1), so that these provisions now read:\n\n(b) not more than ten permanent members appointed for life; and\n\n(c) not more than ten other members appointed for a period of three years.\n\nSir, as regards the third amendment of Article 81(P).-(1) whereby it is sought to lower the quorum of the Council from ten to eight members, the Council is of the opinion that eight would he a more realistic figure, having regard to the fact that the full membership of 21 has not been filled and is not likely to be completely filled in the near future. And there being at present only 14 members including the Chairman, it would therefore be proper to accede to the Council's wishes in this regard.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nAmendments agreed to.\n\nClause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nBill reported with amendments; read a Third time and passed. TRADE UNIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.40 p.m.\n\nThe Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, section 47 of the Trade Unions Act currently limits the land which a registered trade union may purchase or take upon lease to an area not exceeding one acre in extent. This piece of legislation was made about 32 years ago. There are at present 28 trade unions comprising 16 unions of employers and 12 unions of employees which own office buildings on land either leased or purchased by them. None of the land area held by them exceeds one acre.\n\nHowever, with enlarged membership and growing affluence, it is anticipated that more and more trade unions will be able to purchase or lease land to build their own offices. Moreover, the larger trade unions may wish to purchase land to build their branch offices as well. At the moment, they are prevented by law from doing so if the aggregate area of land to he owned by them exceeds one acre.\n\nHence, unless section 47 of the Trade Unions Act is amended as proposed, the trade unions will he restricted in their efforts to build offices or branch offices for their members. Such restriction could retard the healthy growth and development of the trade union movement in Singapore, especially from the administrative and financial point of view. It is, therefore, necessary to introduce the Bill now before the House.\n\nThe Bill seeks to amend section 47 of the Trade Unions Act with a view to empowering the Minister to approve in any particular case the purchase or taking upon lease by a trade union of land that exceeds one acre in extent.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Sia Kah Hui].\n\nBill considered in Committee. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\n3.41 p.m.\n\nClause 1 -\n\nThe Chairman: There is a note, in page 1, line 4, to leave out \"1972\" and insert \"1973\". This will be done.\n\nClause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nBill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.44 p.m.\n\nThe Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill he now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe main object or this Bill is to provide for a motor insurance policy to cover the full period for which a licence (road tax) is granted to a vehicle. At present a vehicle owner needs only to possess a valid insurance policy on the date when the licence comes into operation. This can result in the insurance policy expiring before the vehicle licence, giving rise to a situation whereby a vehicle though properly licensed is without a valid insurance cover. This can go undetected during the period of the licence unless the vehicle is involved in an accident. The new requirement would therefore remove the existing anomaly in respect of the insurance cover for motor vehicles.\n\nAnother object of the Bill is to give the Registrar of Vehicles additional powers to cancel the registration of motor vehicles whose licences have not been renewed for more than three years, or when the vehicles have been destroyed, permanently exported, or have become totally unfit, or have exceeded the age limit prescribed for that class or description of vehicle. The present Act has no provision\n\nempowering the ROV to de-register vehicles whose owners have failed to renew the licences over a long period of time. As a result there are many \"dead\" vehicles on the register. The proposed amendment will minimise the number of \"dead\" vehicles that are maintained on the register.\n\nClause 2 of the Bill seeks to increase the late payment fees for renewals made after expiry of the vehicle licence (road tax). At present a late payment notice fee of 50 cents is charged for renewals made after 10 days of expiry of the licence. A further fee of $5, known as warrant fee, is levied for renewals made after 20 days of expiry of the vehicle licence. This is far from satisfactory and has not been effective in getting vehicle owners to renew their licences promptly. In conjunction with the new scale of road taxes, it is proposed to raise the late payment fee. The new rate for late payment fees would take into account the graduated scale of road taxes and would range from 510 to $50 depending on the class and description of vehicles. For private vehicles, the rate of late payment fees would be determined by the engine capacity. These late payment fees would he levied for renewals made after 14 days to a month of expiry of licence. Renewals made after one month of expiry of licence may be compounded, provided the late payment fees are paid in addition.\n\nClause 6 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new category of public service buses to be called Private Hire Buses. This is to augment the existing public transport service to help meet the demands of office and factory workers, especially those on night shifts. Such buses will be allowed to be hired out on charter or on contract.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n3.46 p.m.\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu): Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember that during the last Parliament sitting the plight of some road accident victims who were\n\nnot able to recover compensation, because of the absence of insurance or defective insurance, was brought to the attention of the House by the Member for Tiong Bahru. I must say, therefore, that the proposed amendment Bill is welcomed.\n\nBut I am just wondering whether the Minister considers it time now to go a step further by setting up a central fund contributed by all motor insurers, so that any claims not paid because of technical reasons can be covered by that fund. It will not cost the Government anything, because the insurers will have to cough out the money.\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng: Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu has brought up a very good suggestion, and we shall give it due consideration.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into, a Committee on the Bill.-[Dr Ang Kok Peng].\n\nBill considered in Committee. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\n3.47 p.m.\n\nClause 1--\n\nThe Chairman: There is a note, in page 1, line 4, to leave out \"1972\" and insert \"1973\". This will be done.\n\nClause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClauses 2 to 6 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nBill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.48 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Arms and Explosives Act (Chapter 238 of the Revised Edition) to empower the\n\nlicensing authority to forfeit any arms or explosives deposited with him in accordance with the provisions of the Act or any rules made thereunder or any other written law for the time being in force, if such deposited arms or explosives are not claimed by its owner or owners within six months.\n\nThe following arms are deposited with the Arms and Explosives Branch of the Singapore Police Force:\n\n(a) Arms belonging to the person whose possession of such arms becomes unlawful in consequence of\n\n(i) expiry of his licence;\n\n(ii) suspension of his licence;\n\n(iii) cancellation of his licence;\n\n(b) Arms belonging to transit passengers which are handed over to the police for safe custody; and\n\n(c) Arms brought into Singapore and waiting for licences to possess.\n\nThere is no difficulty in dealing with arms falling under category (a) aforementioned, as the law on this is clear. Any arms deposited with the police in consequence of the expiry, suspension or cancellation of licences become forfeit if no licence to possess is taken within six months. Arms falling under categories (b) and (c) aforementioned, however, pose a problem, for currently there is no provision in any written law for the disposal of arms not claimed by transit passengers or for which a licence to possess in Singapore is not approved. Such arms have accumulated in the armoury of the Arms and Explosives Branch of the Singapore Police Force over the years and are occupying valuable storage space.\n\nThe number of such arms as on 3rd November, 1972, was as follows:\n Rifles 52 pieces\n\nAir rifles 73 pieces\n\nPistols 62 pieces\n\nRevolvers 21 pieces\n\nAir pistols 15 pieces\n\nShotguns 44 pieces\n\nKrises 63 pieces\n\nSwords 115 pieces\n\nHunting knives 17 pieces\n\nWalking sticks with\n\ndaggers 54 pieces\n\nDaggers 72 pieces\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.----[Mr Chua Sian Chin].\n\nBill considered in Committee. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\n3.54 p.m.\n\nClause 1 -\n\nThe Chairman: There is a note, in page 1, line 4, to leave out \"1972\" and insert \"1973\". This will be done.\n\nClause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nBill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. MISUSE OF DRUGS BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.56 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThis Bill is a consolidation of the Dangerous Drugs Act enacted in 1951 and the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act of 1969. It also incorporates additional provisions to provide for a firm and extensive control on certain dangerous and harmful drugs of addiction as well as heavier penalties. These drugs, defined as \"controlled drugs\" in this Bill, are known to the pharmacologist as hallucinogens, narcotic analgesics, central nervous system stimulants and tranquillisers. The Dangerous Drugs Act was enacted about 21 years ago and the controls provided therein are grossly inadequate\n\nfor the 70's, with the introduction of a host of new drugs of medical value if properly used.\n\nControl has been brought in line with those in force in other countries closely concerned with the spread of the addictive use of such drugs within their own countries and the increased international traffic which supplies such demands. The different categories of control as recommended by the United Nations have been incorporated into this Bill.\n\nThe Bill will provide adequate powers for law enforcement officers in the Customs, Police and narcotics officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau to exercise close vigilance on all movements of controlled drugs and to seek out the addicts to such drugs. The Central Narcotics Bureau, under a Director, has been recently created to enforce the provisions of the Bill especially in regard to illicit use.\n\nSingapore, by its geographical position and development, is now a strategic centre of communication and international trade. Whilst welcoming trade, visitors and tourists, we must at the same time be constantly on the alert for the trafficker, the addict and the hidden consignment of controlled drugs. Law enforcement officers must be adequately empowered to stop, search any ship, aircraft, train or vehicles whenever there are reasonable grounds to suspect that controlled drugs are hidden and, if found, to seize such drugs and to detain any person found therein. Such vehicle will he liable to seizure under certain conditions.\n\nThe ill-gotten gains of the drug traffic are huge. The key men operating behind the scene are ruthless and cunning and possess ample funds. They do their utmost to push their drugs through. Though we may not have drug-trafficking and drug addiction to the same degree as, for instance, in the United States, we have here some quite big-time traffickers and their pedlars moving around the Republic selling\n\ntheir evil goods and corrupting the lives of all those who succumb to them.\n\nThey and their trade must be stopped. To do this effectively, heavy penalties have to be provided for trafficking. Clause 15 specifies the quantities of controlled drugs which, it found in the possession of a person unless the contrary is proved, will be presumed to be in his possession for the purposes of trafficking.\n\nThe Second Schedule to the Bill shows the various penalties for offences committed under the Bill. For unauthorised traffic in a Class A controlled drug, for example, morphine, opium, heroin, the maximum sentence is 20 years or $40,000 or both, and ten strokes of the rotan. The heaviest penalty will apply to those convicted of unauthorised trafficking in a Class A controlled drug to persons under the age of 18 years. For this offence a maximum penalty of 30 years or $50,000 or both, and 15 strokes of the rotan, and a minimum penalty of five years or $10,000 or both, and three strokes of the rotan have been provided. The existing law on dangerous drugs provides for the offence of trafficking, but there is no distinction as regards the age of the person to whom the drugs are sold. The penalties for the offence of trafficking in the existing law are $10,000 or five years, or both. These penalties are obviously totally inadequate as deterrents,\n\nGovernment views the present situation with deep concern. To act as an effective deterrent, the punishment provided for an offence of this nature must be decidedly heavy. We have, therefore, expressly provided minimum penalties and the rotan for trafficking. However, we have not gone as far as some countries which impose the death penalty for drug trafficking.\n\nDrug addiction is a problem increasing in size daily. What was once smoking opium and marijuana (the dried plant which is known locally as ganja) or the consumption of opium pills amongst a comparatively small group of middle-aged or elderly people has developed into the taking of\n\nmethaqualone (known popularly as MX pills) or the smoking of marijuana amongst the younger age group in their teens or early 20's who can be found not only in the street or coffee-shop but also in the school and the university.\n\nThe young person falls under the influence of such a drug in a variety of ways. It might be the result of boredom, sense of adventure to know how it feels by taking it or he might be inducted to it before being accepted as one of the circle of so-called \"friends\". The danger is that when he finds that the effects of such a drug are not too upsetting but rather pleasant in the transient light-headed feeling it induces, he continues to take it.\n\nAfter this, he so very easily progresses to more potent drugs that will give him that same feeling of euphoria after failing to get it with those drugs which he first used, even in increasing quantities. Once he becomes \"hooked\" On a hard drug, e.g, morphine or heroin, his path to ruination and disaster is certain. He will not be able to stop taking such a drug as the physical and mental symptoms known as \"withdrawal symptoms\" following will be unbearable. It is known that once a person is hooked to a hard drug, he will lie, cheat, steal or even kill just to get the drugs. Thus, a drug trafficker is the most abominable of human beings if he can be deemed \"human\". He is a merchant of \"living death\" which he brings to a fellow human being. He, therefore, deserves the maximum punishment.\n\nMembers of this House will, however, note that it is not all punishment written into this Bill. A clear distinction has been made between the drug addict and the trafficker and pedlar. I am moving an amendment at the Committee Stage to remove the provision of a minimum sentence of two years for a second or subsequent offence for smoking, self-administering or consuming a controlled drug as provided in the Second Schedule to clause 29, which was inserted as a result of an oversight. For those addicts who wish to stop this vicious habit, there are provisions under clause 33 (3) for them to volunteer for\n\ntreatment at an approved institution. Any statement given for the purpose of undergoing treatment will not be admissible as evidence against him in any subsequent prosecution. Anyone who has been addicted to any of the controlled drugs and especially those who have had their first acquaintance with such a drug can take advantage of this provision to have himself rehabilitated. Powers have also been provided for the Director, Central Narcotics Bureau, under clause 33, to require any person, whom he has reasonable grounds to suspect to he an addict, to be medically examined and, it necessary, to undergo treatment at an approved institution. All outpatient clinics and centres have been organised to provide for treatment of drug addicts. A referral clinic has been established at the Outram Road Hospital. A second one is planned for Alexandra Hospital. A special ward for the hospital care of addicts will be opened within the year.\n\nBesides the drug trafficker there is also another danger, though on a lesser scale, that is, the tourist drug addict, particularly among the hippies. To seek out such drug addicts amongst the huge and increasing number of tourists entering Singapore, powers have been provided in clause 28 of the Bill for an immigration officer, where he has reasonable grounds to suspect any person to be a drug addict, to request that person to provide a specimen of urine for testing. Entry of any person, other than a Singapore citizen or a permanent resident here, will be prohibited if he refuses to submit to such a test or if the test shows the presence of a controlled drug. It is Government's firm intention to exclude entry of such tourist addicts for their habits are imitative and the youth of our Republic must be protected from it.\n\nThe Second Schedule also lists the penalties provided for other offences under this Bill. For instance, any person being the owner, tenant, occupier or person in charge of any premises who permits the use of such premises for the purposes of smoking, administering or consumption of a Class A or B\n\ndrug will, if found guilty, be liable to imprisonment of up to ten years or a fine not exceeding $40,000 or both the minimum penalty for this offence is two years or $4,000 or both. The current penalty is three years or $10,000 or both. Unauthorised possession on conviction will draw a maximum sentence of ten years or $20,000 or both, with a minimum punishment for a second or subsequent offence of two years or $3,000 or both. The current penalty for possession of raw opium is five years or $10,000 or both, and for a dangerous drug prepared for medical use, three years or $10,000 or both.\n\nA District or Magistrate's Court is empowered to hear and determine all proceedings under this Bill and to impose the full penalties provided.\n\nClause 34 provides for the making of regulations especially for the trade and use of controlled drugs for licit purposes. Certain professional persons-doctors, dentists, pharmacists, veterinary surgeons and others - who use or handle such drugs in the course of their professions or businesses will be authorised to possess controlled drugs, and in certain cases, where applicable, to supply such controlled drugs. Doctors and dentists will be required to report any person suspected of being a drug addict. The new regulations will provide for the keeping of more detailed records of import, sale, supply and use of controlled drugs so as to provide better means of checking the movement of controlled drugs within the Republic.\n\nThe Singapore Association of Social Workers have submitted a memorandum on the Bill. In it, they have recommended that clause 27 (c) of the Bill be amended so that professional social workers be exempted from the law of having to divulge confidential information gained from drug addicts in the course of their work in rehabilitating the addict. This suggestion cannot be accepted since even doctors are not exempt from revealing such confidences if this is required by the Courts. However, clause 32 gives protection to\n\npersons acting under authority from any civil or criminal liability. This should be adequate for the protection of the social worker who acts in good faith.\n\nThey have also suggested the listing of approved institutions to include non-governmental institutions for the treatment of drug addicts. It is not necessary to do this in the main Act. This can be done under regulations to be made under the Act.\n\nThey have also suggested the setting up of an advisory panel of persons to determine the drug pushers from the drug addicts. This recommendation has been made on the assumption that it is difficult to differentiate between the two. Such arm assumption is, of course, not correct. The Central Narcotics Bureau, together with the doctors involved in the rehabilitation of addicts, will certainly know how to make the distinction and act accordingly.\n\nThey have also suggested that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee to consider their aforementioned proposals. In view of what I have stated in reply to the Association's recommendations, reference to a Select Committee is clearly unnecessary.\n\nFinally, I wish to state quite categorically here that whatever heavy penalties that are being provided in this Bill, they by themselves are not sufficient to solve the drug problem in Singapore. We shall require all the co-operation from parents, teachers, doctors, social workers and, in fact, the whole public if we are to successfully meet that problem. It is going to be an uphill task all the way. Of course, highly deterrent laws against drug traffickers will help us tremendously in our fight against drug trafficking and addiction.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n4.15 p.m.\n\nMr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words in support of this Bill, particularly on the problem of drug abuse which this Bill seeks to resolve.\n\nFor some time now the mass media have periodically focused attention on the problems of drug abuse and have thereby aroused in the public an awareness of its dangers. Be that as it may, I am not convinced that this awareness alone is an adequate defence against drug abuse. Hence, it is my view that the enhanced punishment in the penalty clauses of this Bill is beneficial to our society.\n\nI am prepared to grant that the enlightened parent in control of the family is a deterrent to drug abuse. The question which then arises is just how many parents are sufficiently enlightened and, more significant still, how many of these enlightened parents have control of their children who are prone to the attractions of drugs and their abuses?\n\nPublic knowledge of the dangers of drug abuse is an important step in the effort to construct an effective social defence against drug abuse. The public should be given ample opportunity to acquire this knowledge through the mass media. I do not think we need worry about over-acting to the fears of drug abuse. If we are not alert we may suddenly find the disease firmly rooted in our society. By that time we would he extremely knowledgeable about drugs for we would be in direct touch with the ghastly realities of drug addiction of all kinds. To know of the dangers of drug abuse when the decrepit human remnants of drug addiction surface onto our streets is to know of the dangers too late. I say that the time to worry is now.\n\nThe Tri-Border Area of Thailand, Burma and Laos, sometimes known as the `Golden Triangle\", has probably become the main source of heroin and other opiates, after Turkey decided to outlaw opium production in its highlands. This change has brought the world's principal narcotics source close to us. Meanwhile, the Vietnam conflict has had the effect of dramatically increasing the demand for narcotics.\n\nIn August, 1971, a sub-committee on Public Health and Environment of the House of Representatives in the U.S.\n\nconducted investigations into the production and abuse of opiates in the Far East. Members of the sub-committee visited Thailand, South Vietnam, Hongkong and Japan. In that report, the sub-committee estimated that the amount of opium and its derivatives that would be produced for 1971 in the Tri-Border Area would be as high as 1,000 tons. The large bulk of heroin and opiates, which leave Mae Sai in the Thai-Burma border, pass through Bangkok to Hongkong and then to South Vietnam, Okinawa, the U.S, and other countries. It seems to me that with the cessation of the Vietnam conflict and the withdrawal of foreign forces from Indo-China, a large quantity of surplus narcotics in South-east Asia would be seeking new markets. We join other quarters in hoping that the Thai Authorities will record greater success in their effort to contain opium production with the support of the U.N, programme of crop substitution among the tribesmen in the highlands.\n\nThough there is no indication that heroin is presently a much used drug in the country, let us not beguile ourselves with the notion that our society is safe from it. In our society today, the industries are manned by new generations of youthful workers in whom we hope the work ethic of their fathers and forefathers remains unadulterated. This work ethic has accounted for our national growth hitherto, and we naturally hope that our young will retain it to stand them in good stead in the future. However, young generations tend to colour the moral, cultural and social values of their times with their own sense of worth and their own understanding of the rational. Sometimes they even abandon established values altogether.\n\nTwo facts may be stressed. First, youth predominate in our society. Secondly, our society is very much exposed to foreign values which, more often than not, are inconsonant with our own way of life. The degree and extent of erosion upon the work ethic of our youthful national work force will be determined by the degree and extent\n\nof their response to these foreign values which, unfortunately, reach our youth in a highly attractive and heavily publicised fashion in which drugs feature as the sole instrument of communion with narcotic bliss.\n\nWith affluence spreading through the social fabric, work as an ethic may lose its meaningfulness as opportunity for leisure increases and the quest for excitement and euphoria becomes more deliberate. In this situation, drug offers an irresistible invitation to such excitement and euphoria. And to those seeking a momentary escape from the stresses and strains of a successful industrial society, the narcotics dimension offers much solace and recuperation.\n\nWhen narcotics, other opium derivatives, amphetamines and barbiturates become plentiful in a country, there will manifest the inclination to experiment with drugs. In 1972, for the period January-March, the quantity of various drugs seized by the Customs and Central Narcotics Bureau are as follows:- Ganja a total of about 68 kg.\n\nMorphine a total of about 29 kg.\n\nHeroin a total of less than 1 kg.\n\nOpium a total of about 615 kg.\n\nHashish a total of about 1 kg, and\n\n24,650 MX tablets.\n\nWhat quantity has passed undetected is left to inference. The larger quantity of drugs being detected may be due to the efficiency of the CNB and/or it may simply be the fact that more drugs are flowing into the country. Whatever the case, it is time for us to sit up and appreciate the potential gravity of the situation.\n\nThe drug commonly abused by some sections of our youth is ganja. They do not regard this drug as harmful and sometimes equate it with the permissible intoxicates, such as brandy and whisky. `This, I think, is due to the fact that the dangers of ganja abuse is not common knowledge among our youth, which should not be the case. There is\n\nsufficient material by the experts which assert that ganja or marijuana is an \"initiation drug.\" While it does not develop in the person a physical dependence on the drug, it does so psychologically. It initiates the consumer into the narcotics experience and to a life of warp, irrelevant, wasteful and anti-social values. He may not he drug-dependent; but he is drug-oriented. Whether he subsequently degenerates to addiction to hard drugs will, I think, depend on whether there is in him a moral, cultural and social ballast.\n\nWhich brings me to what I believe is the second requisite to an effective social defence against drug abuse, that is, parental control of children. By control, I mean that kind of relationship between parents and their children which stems from an enlightened authority that is vested in the parents through common love and respect, on which authority members of the family depend and to which they respond. It is authority which is the result of close and concerned management of sons and daughters through childhood and adolescence undertaken within the cohesion of the family.\n\nIn present times a number of social trends and actions militate against family cohesion. Pressured by the demands of daily living, the family is in a state of constant motion. The motion is centrifugal in relation to the home, tearing members of the family away from the home and each other disintegrating the family unit. If this, development is not checked somewhat, our society is going to be that much weakened; for moral, cultural and social values can only inhere in members of the family which live in harmonious and intelligent cohesion. I believe that, in the last analysis, the moral, cultural and social ballast in the individuals of our society constitute in its totality our most effective social defence against drug abuse.\n\nIn this connection, I have on a number of occasions urged parents to retain or recover this family cohesion by insisting upon all members of the family to daily-gather around for dinner\n\nThis will, at least in my view, ensure that once in every day, the family will assemble and the unit becomes intact. This moment will provide opportunity for communication, understanding and inspiration, all of which make for family cohesion. The family that eats together, I say, stays together.\n\nThe fact that the law is finding it necessary to severely punish with imprisonment up to 10 years persons who consume or have in their possession a controlled drug may be regarded as an indictment against parents. If this realisation jolts complacent parents to a more responsible action and supervision of their children's affairs, this Bill will succeed in launching a drug alert in our country, and in co-operation with the law we will effectively combat drug abuse in our society.\n\n4.29 p.m.\n\nMr Teong Eng Siong(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill. The introduction of this Bill, I believe, will be supported by people from all walks of life. It cannot be denied that our society is facing the problem of drug addiction. There is a small number of people who indulges in this drug abuse. These drug addicts live an unrealistic life and do not engage in any form of production. They day-dream all day long, and become useless. This will not only incur displeasure and cause worry to their parents but will also pose a serious problem to our society.\n\nThe reasons for drug addiction are many and varied. Some drug addicts have been easily influenced by their social environment and their friends. Some of them have been influenced by tourists from abroad, who have brought these drugs with them. For example, some hippies have been known to have done this. We must therefore take steps to prevent them from entering our country.\n\nThe Minister emphasised just now that the Government is taking a serious view of this matter and is empowering Immigration officials to prohibit the entry of any person whom they suspect to be drug traffickers. If hippies from abroad are allowed to come in to spread\n\nthe use of drugs, it will have serious effects on our society or will cause serious repercussions in our country.\n\nIn order to eliminate this problem, I think it is necessary not only to introduce the various measures as provided in this Bill but also to deal with it in a two-fold manner. Firstly, I would suggest to the Minister that every year we should hold an anti-drug campaign on a big scale, similar to what he has done for the Ministry of Health, i.e, the Keep Singapore Clean campaign. This anti-drug campaign should be conducted in the various constituencies in order to bring home the lessons of the harm and ill-effects of drugs. In this way parents will be more aware of the dangers and they will be able to face the problem properly. Secondly, I would like to suggest that the Minister should pay special attention to the youth in our country. The Ministry of Health and the relevant departments, for example, the Police Force, should establish more contacts with the people in our society. Contacts between the Police and the people on a wider scale will help the Police to be \"in the society\", so that they will know where the drug addicts are and where the drugs are to be found. This will help reduce the phenomenon of drug addiction. This, I think, is a better and a more positive measure of dealing with the problem.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, we are a young nation. Sixty per cent of our population are below the age of 21. We should therefore take special steps and pay more attention to the problems of youth in our society. We should protect them from all evil influences. If we are concerned with their problems, we can help them to become a more rugged, strong and firm generation, so that they can contribute towards our nation building.\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have anything more to add, except to thank the two speakers who have very strongly supported the Bill.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the BiIl.---[Mr Chua Sian Chin].\n\nBill considered in Committee.

In each case, the alterations are listed in the Order Paper Supplement * and they will be made. * The alterations listed in the Order Paper Supplement read as follows: Clause 1:\n\nIn page 1, line 5, to leave out \"1972\" and insert \"1973'.\n\nFirst Schedule:\n\n(1) In page 72, line 3, to leave out \"1972\" and insert \"1973\".\n\n(2) In page 73, line 2, to leave out \"1972\" and insert \"1973\".\n\nSecond Schedule:\n\n(1) In page 74, line 12, to leave out \"1972\" and insert \"1973\".\n\n(2) In page 74, line 17, to leave out \"1972\" and insert \"1973\".\n\n(3) In page 75, line 2, to leave out \"1972\" and insert \"1973\".\n\n(4) In page 75, line 8, to leave out \"1972\" and insert \"1973\".\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\n\nRECLAMATION (SUNGEI SEMBAWANG)\n\n4.40 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion+ standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper. + The motion, standing in the name of the Minister for Law and National Development, reads as follows:\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation by Government of those portions of the foreshore and seabed off Sungei Sembawang containing a total area of approximately 4.71 acres as shown coloured yellow, red and green respectively on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 7/72\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore, and the dredging of approximately 3.16 acres of the seabed off Sungei Sembawang shown coloured and hatched in blue on the same plan.\n\nSir, the Sembawang Shipyard (Private) Limited, a corporation set up by Government to run the former Naval Dockyards at Sembawang as a ship-repairing centre, is presently occupying the land and buildings within the area shown edged red on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 7/72\" (a copy of which is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of hon. Members), on a 60-year lease.\n\nAs part of its expansion scheme, the Shipyard proposes to construct a new dry dock at Sungei Sembawang parallel to the existing King George VI Dock at an estimated cost of $31.64 million to be completed by the end of 1974. The floor area of the proposed drydock will be about 6.15 acres, comprising nearly three acres of the existing land to be excavated (coloured blue on the plan) and another 3.16 acres of the seabed to be dredged (coloured and hatched blue). The foreshore and seabed near the proposed drydock, i.e, the portions shown coloured yellow (about 2.36 acres), coloured pink (about 1.59 acres) and coloured green about 0.76 acre), will be reclaimed. Earth obtained from the excavation of the area shown coloured blue on the plan will be used as fill for the proposed reclamations.\n\nThe dredging and reclamation works will be undertaken by the Sembawang Shipyard as agent of the Government. On completion, the drydock and the adjoining reclaimed area will be proclaimed as State land and alienated to the Shipyard on terms and conditions to be agreed with the Land Office.\n\nAlthough the total area of the foreshore and seabed to be reclaimed is only 4.71 acres, approval of this House under section 4 of the Foreshores Act is necessary since the project also involves the dredging of some 3.16 acres of the seabed.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation by Government of those portions of the foreshore and seabed off Sungei Sembawang containing a total area of approximately 4.71 acres as shown coloured yellow, red and green respectively on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 7/72\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore, and the dredging of approximately 3.16 acres of the seabed off Sungei Sembawang shown coloured and hatched in blue on the same plan.\n\nPULAU AYER MERLIMAU (Construction of Docks, Jetties and other Public Works)\n\n4.42 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E.

Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the\n\nmotion+ standing in my name, as it appears on the Order Paper. + The motion, standing in the name of the Minister for Law and National Development, reads as follows:\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the construction of docks, jetties or other public works and a submarine water pipeline along or out from those portions of the foreshores at Pulau Ayer Merlimau, as shown coloured green and in broken blue line on the plan marked as `LAND OFFICE PLAN NO. 1/73\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.\n\nSir, you will recall that at its sitting on 19th October, 1971, this House approved the reclamation of about 170 acres of the foreshore and seabed at Pulau Ayer Merlimau as shown coloured yellow on the plan marked as \"LAND OFFICE PLAN No. 1/73\", a copy of which is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of Members. This reclamation, undertaken by the Jurong Town Corporation as agent of the Government, is now in progress. On completion, the whole of Pulau Ayer Merlimau, comprising about 150 acres of dry land (shown edged red on the plan) and the reclaimed area, will be alienated to the Corporation for 99 years to enable the Corporation in turn to sub-lease the island to the Singapore Petroleum Company (Private) Limited for the development of an oil refinery.\n\nThe Corporation has now applied on behalf of the Singapore Petroleum Company for foreshore leases in respect of -\n\n(a) those portions of the foreshore and seabed at Pulau Ayer Merlimau shown coloured green on the plan for the construction of:\n\n(i) an oil handling dock for receiving crude oil for processing and shipment of petroleum products;\n\n(ii) a dry cargo dock for receiving equipment and materials for the maintenance of the refinery,\n\nship dry products, such as sulphur and drummed asphalt and bunker barges and ships;\n\n(iii) a personnel jetty for the landing and disembarking of personnel to operate and maintain the refinery;\n\n(iv) a dredge water intake for sea water intake to cool product streams in the refinery process; and\n\n(b) a small area of the foreshore and seabed adjacent to Pulau Ayer Merlimau (also shown coloured green) to include rights and liberties for the construction of a 10-inch submarine water pipeline across the seabed from Pulau Ayer Merlimau to Pulau Ayer Chawan, as shown in broken blue line on the plan.\n\nUnder section 4 of the Foreshores Act, approval of this House is necessary before any work can be carried out.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the construction of docks, jetties or other public works and a submarine water pipeline along or out from those portions of the foreshores at Pulau Ayer Merlimau, as shown coloured green and in broken blue line on the plan marked as \"LAND OFFICE PLAN NO. 1/73\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore. DEPARTMENTAL TITLES: 4.45 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W.
