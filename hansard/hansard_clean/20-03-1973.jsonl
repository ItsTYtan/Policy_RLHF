Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Culture how many (i) television licences; and (ii) radio licences were issued during the year ending 28th February, 1973.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Encik Sha'ari Bin Tadin) (for the Minister for Culture): Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of television licences issued during the year ended 28th February, 1973, totalled 210,000. This number includes an estimated figure for the month of February, 1973. Of this number, 28,800 are new licences issued during this period, and 181,200 are renewals of old licences.\n\nA television licence will enable the licensee, members of his family and domestic servants residing at the same address, to use any number of TV and radio receivers, including portable transistor sets. It is not possible to indicate how many of these 210,000 TV licensees own radio sets as well. However, from the experience of the Inland Revenue Department, it is known that almost every household which owns a TV set would have in addition one or two more radio sets.\n\nThe number of radio licences issued during the year ended 28th February, 1973, totalled approximately 70,000. This number includes an estimated figure for the month of February 1973. Of this number, about 35,000 are car radio licences and 35,000 are household radio licences. Of the 35,000 car radio licences, 10,000 are new car radio licences and 25,000 are renewals of old car radio\n\nlicences. Of the 35,000 household radio licences, 4,800 are new radio licences and 30,200 are renewals of old radio licences. A household radio licence will enable the licensee, members of his family and domestic servants residing at the same address, to use any number of radio receivers, including portable transistor sets. A separate licence is required for every radio and television receiver installed in a vehicle, vessel or aircraft registered in Singapore. A radio licence is $12 per annum whereas a television licence is $36 per annum. A radio licence may be converted to a television licence on payment of an additional $24.\n\nBANNED FILMS (Particulars)\n\n2. Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Culture how many films were banned from screening during the year ending 28th February, 1973, and the reasons therefor.\n\nEncik Sha'ari Bin Tadin (for the Minister for Culture): Mr Speaker, Sir, 76 films were banned by the Board of Film Censors during the year ending 28th February, 1973. Cinematograph films may be banned for various reasons, such as the glorification of gangsterism, violence, crime, hippism, free love, promiscuity, homosexuality, lesbianism, incest, permissiveness, religious prejudice and racism. A few films were banned for political reasons.\n\nINFLATION (Government measures)\n\n3. Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Finance what steps he has taken or proposes to take to combat inflation.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, taking first\n\nthe monetary aspect of inflation, Members will recall that in my Budget statement I singled out inflation as a problem deserving particular attention. I have outlined in some detail the monetary measures which have been taken to absorb the excess liquidity in the economy to check inflationary pressures. The most recent policy action was the increase of the minimum reserve requirement which banks and finance companies have to maintain with the Monetary Authority of Singapore against their deposit liabilities from 5 per cent to 9 per cent. Similarly, the special deposit which banks have to keep with MAS against their net foreign liabilities has been increased from 5 per cent to 9 per cent. These measures came into effect on 16th March, 1973. The effects of these measures on credit creation and the money supply will be felt in the coming months.\n\nThe domestic monetary situation will be closely watched particularly in the light of new developments in the international currency markets. We can draw on a number of other policy instruments to meet any new situation that may arise.\n\nSecondly, as to local price increases of essential commodities, I have already outlined in the debate on the Ministry of Finance Estimates the steps we can take and have taken to moderate such prices. What we cannot do is to prevent failure of crops in large areas of the world, causing a world shortage of rice, wheat, sugar, and other essential commodities, which cause a rise in the prices of these commodities. Let us hope there is a fair harvest this year so that grain prices will go back to normal. However, we cannot avoid a rise in the cost of imports of manufactured goods, resulting from the increased wages and inflation of some industrial countries. Of course, some of these countries may have, from time to time, to devalue their currencies but it never brings prices back to what they used to be.\n\nREVISION OF SALARIES FOR THE PRESIDENT AND CABINET MINISTERS (Statement by the Prime Minister)\n\n2.35 p.m.\n\nThe Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is 18 years, since 1955, when the salary for the post of Chief Minister, and subsequently Prime Minister, was fixed at $3,500. The position for Ministers became intolerable by 1970, when an adjustment had to be made. It is time to do a more complete revision of these salaries.\n\nI have discussed this matter with my colleagues in Cabinet and decided as follows: -\n\n(1) All Cabinet Ministers will be paid the salary of $7,000, i.e. $500 more than Superscale Grade A ($6,500).\n\n(2) Dr Goh Keng Swee, who acts for me from time to time, will fill the post of Deputy Prime Minister. It will carry a salary of $8,000.\n\n(3) Dr Toh Chin Chye will have a Charge Allowance of $700 for discharging the duties of Vice-Chancellor of the University of Singapore, as well as being Minister for Science and Technology.\n\n(4) Senior Minister of State will be equivalent to Superscale Grade C ($4,500), Minister of State equivalent to Superscale Grade D ($3,500), Senior Parliamentary Secretary equivalent to Superscale Grade F ($2,750), Parliamentary Secretary equivalent to Super-scale Grade G ($2,500), and Political Secretary, $1,750.\n\n(5) My own salary as Prime Minister will be $9,500.\n\n(6) The President's emoluments will be raised from $4,000, which is tax-free, to $12,000, with $4,000 tax-free. However, the President has requested me to inform the House that he does not wish to make use of this increase in his salary.\n\nAs in the case of civil servants, these salaries will be effective from 1st March\n\nthis year, and they will be revised and consolidated every four to five years.\n\nIn making these adjustments in salaries, two considerations have been uppermost in our minds. First, the need for some rough correlation with the Civil Service pay scales. Second, they should be sufficiently realistic, so that in the years ahead, it will not be so much of a sacrifice to give up a job in the private sector in order to take on the responsibilities of public office.\n\nIt is seldom possible to pay a man in his Ministerial position as much as what he would get, either in running a business or practising his own profession. Some sacrifice is inevitable. But too great a disparity between Ministerial rewards and what Ministers, with business experience and professional qualifications, could earn outside will make it increasingly difficult to assemble a successor government.\n\nNo salary, however generous, can ensure the complete honesty and integrity with which Ministers must discharge their duties. Honest mistakes or errors of judgment by Ministers, however costly, are not as damaging to a country as the suspicion of bias because of corruption. Once a government is tainted with this, the contamination spreads throughout the administration. Then we shall go down the slippery slope, at the bottom of which are carcasses of so many corrupt governments whose peoples have had to suffer for the dishonesty and greed of those in authority.\n\nIt may not be possible to gather another team as the one thrown up by the challenge of tumultuous events and cataclysmic changes, from Japanese occupation to guerilla insurgency, to self-government, to merger, to separate independence. But it is possible to set standards of integrity and competence and to establish them as minimum norms for people holding public office.\n\nAppendix to Statement by the Prime Minister(Cols 1091-2)(Cols 1109-1110)\n\nRADIATION PROTECTION BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n2.41 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker) (for the Minister for Science and Technology): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nIonizing radiation from radioactive materials and irradiating apparatus are potentially dangerous, and excessive exposure to such radiation can seriously impair human and animal health. It was for this reason that the Minister for Science and Technology appointed an Ad Hoc Committee in May, 1969, to advise on matters relating to the use of radioisotopes and irradiating apparatus.\n\nThrough specific licensing on imports introduced by the Ad Hoc Committee in 1970 and through a survey conducted by the Ministry, it was ascertained that currently there are at least 170 irradiating apparatus and at least 4,500 curies of radioisotopes in use in Singapore. Further, the rate of importation of radioisotopes and irradiating apparatus is estimated at an average of 18 imports per month for the year 1971 as compared to 15 imports per month for the year 1970. Most of the irradiating apparatus are X-ray machines while in the case of radioactive material they are mainly in the form of Cobalt 60 (for healing purposes), Iridium 192 (for industrial radiography) and a scatter of Tritium and Caesium and others (for use in non-destructive testing or as radioactive tracers). The number of persons trained to handle radioactive material and irradiating apparatus is also on the increase and at the last count, they numbered about 150.\n\nIrradiating apparatus and radioisotopes are mainly used by three major sectors, namely, industries, Government and institutions of higher learning. In the industrial sector, the uses of irradiating apparatus and radioisotopes are mainly confined to non-destructive testing and radioactive tracer technology\n\nwith the shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries as a dominant user (testing of weld). In the Government sector, these are mainly used in hospitals for diagnostic and healing purposes while in the institutions of higher learning, they are used for research purposes.\n\nWith growing sophistication and expansion in our industries and medical services, it is anticipated that the variety and quantity of imports of radioisotopes and irradiating apparatus would register very significant increases in the years to come to be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the number of persons trained to handle such material and apparatus.\n\nIn the main, the Bill seeks to make provision for the regulation and control of importation, manufacture, sale, disposal, transportation, possession and use of radioactive materials and irradiating apparatus such that these activities may not be permitted except with a licence to be issued by the Director of Radiation Protection who shall be appointed by the Minister for Science and Technology for the administration of the proposed legislation.\n\nMore specifically, the Bill provides for the licensing of pharmacists, medical practitioners and veterinary surgeons to authorise these persons to sell and to use radioactive materials for the treatment of human beings and animals. The Bill further requires workers handling radioactive material and irradiating apparatus to be protected from the hazards of over-exposure through constant monitoring of their exposure levels and regular medical examination. There are also provisions in the Bill whereby persons aggrieved by the enforcement of the proposed legislation may have an avenue of appeal to the Minister.\n\nFinally, the Bill empowers the Minister to make subsidiary legislation for a more effective enforcement of the proposed legislation and to establish a Radiation Advisory Committee to advise on matters pertaining to the provisions of the Bill.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr E. W. Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. BUILDINGS AND COMMON PROPERTY (MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n2.51 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nLarge numbers of high-rise flats and other buildings have been constructed in Singapore in recent years, and many of them are not properly managed and maintained. In many cases, the owners, management corporations or persons responsible for their maintenance and management have not been discharging their functions properly and have allowed the buildings to fall into disrepair. Steps have to be taken to ensure that this unsatisfactory position is rectified before it further deteriorates. With the encouragement of condominium development, the need to ensure that the buildings and the amenities and facilities shared in common are properly managed and maintained has now become even more urgent. It is therefore proposed to set up a public authority with appropriate powers to deal with this problem. It is to this end that this Bill is now before the House.\n\nUnder the Bill, provision is made for the appointment of a Commissioner of Buildings who is empowered under clause 4 to direct the owners of buildings and common properties, which are not kept or maintained in a state of good and serviceable repair or in a proper and clean condition, to carry out the necessary maintenance and repairs.\n\nFailure to comply with the directions of the Commissioner will be an offence under the Bill, for which the penalty shall be a maximum fine of $5,000 with a continuing fine of up to $25 a day. If his directions are not complied with, the Commissioner may also carry out the maintenance and repairs to the buildings and common properties or authorise any other person to carry out the necessary work.\n\nUnder clause 5, the Commissioner may require deposits to be made within seven days by owners of buildings and common properties who fail to comply with his directions.\n\nClause 7 provides for the recovery of costs and expenses incurred by the Commissioner from the owners of buildings and common property, as well as for the apportionment by the Commissioner of such costs and expenses amongst owners, if there is more than one, in such manner as the Commissioner thinks fit.\n\nClause 11 empowers the Minister to make rules to provide, amongst other things, for the prescribing of proper standards of management and maintenance in respect of buildings and common property, and for the payment of deposits by any person erecting or constructing a building to ensure its proper management or maintenance and for the forfeiture of such deposits.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n2.55 p.m.\n\nMr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems fair enough for a Bill of this nature to be introduced. But there are certain defects in the Bill. I do not know whether the definition of \"owner\" of property would also include the Government. The Government owns a great number of buildings and properties, and I do not really know whether the intention of the Bill is to include the Government in the definition of \"owner\". If the Bill is meant for owners of properties in the private sector, then\n\nif any such owner infringes the provisions of this Bill, he may be sued by Government in court. But if the Government itself is guilty of such offences, who will serve the summons on the Government to appear in court? I am therefore a bit puzzled as to whether the definition of \"owner\" in this Bill includes the Government. If it does not include the Government, then I think it is necessary to look further into the matter to see whether there is any need to include the Government in the definition. Otherwise the people will say that the Government is allowed to get away with all sorts of infringements but the common people are not.\n\nMr Barker: Sir, this Bill is all-embracing. There is nothing specific to put the Government or any statutory board outside the provisions of the Bill. Perhaps to keep the Member for Bras Basah happy, I will enlighten him. He has asked to whom should any notice be served? Well, in this case the Commissioner will have the duty, pleasant or unpleasant, of serving notice either on the Government or on the head of any statutory board, whether it is the Housing and Development Board, the Public Utilities Board, the Port of Singapore Authority, or even the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board, if it owns and lets out property.\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the Minister. But I still think that we should write it into the Bill. Otherwise it is very vague. I do not think the Commissioner of Buildings is likely to take such steps, and this is exactly what I fear will arise later.\n\nMr Barker: Sir, it is very difficult to satisfy the Member. There is no need to specifically write it into the 13i11. If we wanted to direct this Bill at the private sector only, we would have said so and would have specifically exempted the Government or any statutory board from the provisions of this Bill. We have not done this, which means, as I said earlier, this Bill is all-embracing.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr E. W. Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. ROAD VEHICLES (SPECIAL POWERS) (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.00 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Road Vehicles (Special Powers) Act (Chapter 120 of the Revised Edition) to enable the Court to order forfeiture of vehicles used in the commission of offences such as assisting in carrying on a public lottery, and writing, printing or publishing any lottery ticket.\n\nPrior to the passing of the Common Gaming Houses (Amendment) Act, 1971 (No. 25 of 1971), these offences were embodied in paragraphs (c) and (f) of subsection (1) of section 4 of the Common Gaming Houses Act (Chapter 96 of the Revised Edition). By the passing of the Common Gaming Houses (Amendment) Act, 1971, these provivisions are now embodied in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 4A and in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 4 of that Act.\n\nThe Schedule to the Road Vehicles (Special Powers) Act (Chapter 120 of the Revised Edition) sets out the offences where the Court has power to order forfeiture of vehicles used in their commission. This Bill seeks to make the necessary consequential amendments to that Schedule by substituting the references to the repealed provisions of the Common Gaming Houses Act with references to the existing provisions of that Act.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Chua Sian Chin].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\n\nSTATUTES OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL\n\nOrder for Second Reading read.\n\n3.04 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nAs a result of the recent reorganisation of the junior ranks of the Police Force giving effect to the recommendations of the Lee Soo Ann Report, police officers of the rank of Sergeant and the newly created rank of Station Inspector will now take over some of the investigatory functions formerly performed by Inspectors. To enable them to discharge their new responsibilities, it is necessary to confer on Sergeants and Station Inspectors, Police powers hitherto exercisable only by officers of the rank of Inspector and above.\n\nThis Bill seeks to amend the various Statutes of our Republic to achieve this objective.\n\nUnder the reorganised set-up, recruitment to the junior ranks of the Police Force is from persons holding at the minimum, the School Certificate or its equivalent. The Police Academy is also conducting various courses to improve the skills, upgrade the professional expertise, and generally raise the standards of Police Officers. As a result, the junior ranks of the Force are being staffed by better calibre officers, and those who have been promoted to the\n\ngrades of Sergeant and Station Inspector can safely be entrusted with these additional powers.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Chua Sian Chin].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. ENTERTAINMENTS DUTY (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.10 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Entertainments Duty Act (Chapter 136 of the Revised Edition) in order to enable more effective action to be taken against touts of cinema tickets. Touting in black-market cinema tickets has increased in recent years despite regular raids mounted by law enforcement officers. In July last year, a special anti-tout squad was formed by the Customs Department, and since the inception of this squad, sustained raids have been made resulting in the arrest of 106 touts and 68 cinema patrons for reselling tickets and purchasing black-market tickets respectively. Despite the sustained raids, the black-market and touting unfortunately still exist.\n\nThe major problem for the authorities is the large number of enforcement officers required to prevent touting in black-market tickets, whenever popular films are shown. The purpose of this Bill is therefore to make better use of such officers as we have to fight such cinema touts. Clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill seek to empower any customs officers or police constable to arrest without warrant any person whom he reasonably suspects of committing or\n\nattempting to commit any offence under the Entertainments Duty Act, including black-marketing in cinema tickets. The customs officer or police constable is also empowered to seize from such persons any document or any other thing in respect of which an offence is reasonably believed to have been committed. Presently, these powers are vested only in senior officers of the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Customs and above in the case of the Customs Department, and officers of the rank of Inspector and above in the case of the Police Force.\n\nClause 4 seeks to dispense with the provision in the Act which requires sanction from the Comptroller of Entertainments Duty before a Court can take cognizance of any offence committed under the Act. This should speed up the process of bringing the black-market touts before the Court, and demonstrate clearly that punishment will swiftly follow the crime.\n\nThe last amendment contained in clause 5 seeks to correct an existing anomaly. The penalty for offences committed under the Entertainments Duty Act is prescribed in the Act, but the offences are set out in the Entertainments Duty Rules made under the principal Act.\n\nThe four amendments proposed in this Bill will facilitate enforcement of the law, particularly against organised gangsters and racketeers touting cinema tickets. I should emphasise, however, that legislation alone cannot wholly control and eradicate black-marketing. Greater civic consciousness by the public is also required. The black-market in tickets cannot possibly survive without patronage by the cinema-going public. While our enforcement officers in taking action against black-marketeers will try to ensure that law-abiding cinema-goers are not unduly inconvenienced, they will expect the public to co-operate with them in stamping out the very pernicious practice of black-marketing.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. INSURANCE (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.15 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nIn the light of experience gained from the operation of the Insurance Act, which came into force on 1st January, 1967, certain amendments to the Act seem necessary and desirable for: -\n\n(a) additional provisions to ensure that insurance companies conduct their business strictly in accordance with sound insurance principles;\n\n(b) powers to the Insurance Commissioner to deal expeditiously with insurance companies that become insolvent or are likely to become insolvent; and\n\n(c) more effective control and supervision of insurers and Lloyd's agents and brokers.\n\nThe main objectives of the Bill are those contained in clauses 6 and 10.\n\nClause 6 empowers the Commissioner to cancel the registration of an insurer under certain circumstances which include the failure of the insurer to effect satisfactory reinsurance arrangements, non-compliance with the Commissioner's order to make good any deficiency in its insurance fund, and failure to maintain a surplus of assets over liabilities of $1 million in respect of life business or general business, or $1 1/2 million in respect of both classes. The present Act gives the Commissioner the authority to register an insurance company, but it does not empower him to cancel the registration other than on the ground that the insurer itself, on account that it has ceased to carry on business, applies for cancellation.\n\nClause 10 empowers the Commissioner to issue such directions as he considers necessary to an insurer if he is satisfied that the affairs of the insurer are being conducted in a manner likely to be detrimental to the public interest or the interests of the policy owners or prejudicial to the interests of the insurer. Among the directions which the Commissioner may give include immediate suspension of business, taking all steps to avert future insolvency, making of reinsurance arrangements as the Commissioner specifies, removal of unsuitable persons from positions of authority in the insurance company, and prevention of unscrupulous and unfit persons being appointed as agents by the insurer.\n\nThe other salient clauses are as follows: -\n\nClause 2 will prevent firms and companies, particularly those carrying on business as insurance agents and brokers, from having misleading names containing the word \"insurance\" or any of its derivatives indicating the carrying on of business as an insurer, and thereby deceiving the public.\n\nClause 3 enables the Commissioner to impose conditions on registration of an insurer, and clause 4 enables the Commissioner to add to, vary or revoke the conditions, or impose new conditions.\n\nClause 5 provides for the annual renewal of registration by insurers and the payment of prescribed fees. This will place insurance companies on the same footing as banks and other financial institutions which are at present required to pay annual licence fees.\n\nClause 8 relates to agents and brokers for Lloyd's underwriters carrying on general insurance business in Singapore. It is intended to ensure that the intermediaries placing business with Lloyd's underwriters are financially sound. The provision requires persons who carry on business in Singapore as insurance agents for Lloyd's to have a surplus of assets over liabilities of not less than\n\n$100,000, and in the case of insurance brokers who place business at Lloyd's to furnish a certificate of solvency and effect a professional indemnity cover of not less than $500,000. This will bring insurance agents and brokers for Lloyd's in line with insurance companies which are required to have, inter alia, a surplus of assets over liabilities of not less than $1 million in order to be eligible to apply for registration to carry on life business or general business, or $1 1/2 million for both classes; a deposit of $300,000 with the Accountant-General for one class of business; and to satisfy the Commissioner that they will be able to conduct the business in accordance with sound insurance principles.\n\nClause 8 also provides for the payment by insurance agents and brokers for Lloyd's of such annual fees as may be prescribed.\n\nClause 12 will facilitate payment even where the policies exceed $10,000, provided that such payment does not exceed nine-tenths of the policy monies or $10,000 whichever is the lesser. At present insurers cannot make any cash payment where the policies exceed $10,000 without production of probate or letters of administration. The provision will save the dependants of the deceased unnecessary hardship and expedite payment of a claim where the value of the life policy exceeds $10,000.\n\nThe proposed amendments in this Amendment Bill are of a more urgent nature and will serve until a more comprehensive review of the Insurance Act, which will take some time to complete.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -.[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\n\nJURONG (Jetty and Berth)\n\n3.25 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E.

Members). The site is for the construction of a terminal to provide storage facilities for bulk chemicals required to meet the needs of our local industries.\n\nThe Company has now applied for the allocation of the foreshore and seabed shown edged red on the plan for the docking of bulk tankers to discharge their liquid cargo to the storage tanks to be constructed at the terminal, and for permission to dredge the portions of the seabed shown coloured orange on the plan to provide the necessary depth for the berthing of tankers. As the area shown hatched black which falls within the area edged red now required by the Company has been allocated to Caltex Petroleum Terminal at Jurong, together with the area shown hatched blue, it is proposed to allocate in replacement the area shown edged yellow to Caltex for its berthing facilities.\n\nThe construction works and dredging to be undertaken by the Company as agent of the Government, and estimated to cost the Company about $5 million, however, require approval of this House under section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270).\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the construction by Government of a jetty and berth within the fore-shore and seabed at Jurong containing approximately 29 acres edged red and yellow and the dredging of the several portions of seabed coloured orange on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN No. 4/73\" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.
