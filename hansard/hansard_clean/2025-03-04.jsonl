Permission to be Absent: Causes for Recent SOTA Students Food Poisoning Incident and Details of Shelf-life Product Testing under Food Resilience Preparedness Programme 1 Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what are the causes of the reported food poisoning symptoms in students at the School of the Arts who consumed ready-to-eat meals distributed as part of Total Defence activities; and (b) what microbiological and shelf-life studies are required by the Singapore Food Agency and conducted as part of Food Resilience Preparedness Programme product testing. 2 Mr Yip Hon Weng asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of the suspension of the Total Defence food resilience programme after the School of the Arts food poisoning incident (a) what processes are currently in place to vet suppliers of ready-to-eat meals for all Government programmes; and (b) whether there are plans to introduce more stringent checks or audits to ensure compliance with food safety regulations. 3 Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the gastroenteritis outbreak among students at the School of the Arts after consuming ready-to-eat meals prepared by SATS at a Food Resilience Preparedness Programme on 18 February 2025 (a) how many meals were contaminated and whether the contamination extended to meals for other organisations such as active ageing centres; (b) what are the causes for the contamination; and (c) whether any penalties will be imposed against SATS. The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien): Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to take oral Question Nos 1 to 3 and written Question No 2 in today’s Order Paper, as well as a question on the same topic raised by Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim scheduled for the Sitting on 5 March, together. These five Parliamentary Questions (PQs) relate to the food safety incident at the School of the Arts (SOTA). Mr Speaker: Please go ahead. Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The Food Resilience Preparedness Programme (FRPP) which involved the distribution of over 100,000 Ready-to-Eat (RTE) meals to secondary schools, pre-universities, Institutes of Technical Education, public agencies and Active Ageing Centres, was part of this year’s commemoration of Total Defence Day. The RTE distribution was originally scheduled to take place from 15 February to 28 February. On 19 February 2025, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) was informed that 20 students at SOTA exhibited symptoms of gastroenteritis after they had consumed RTE meals. Students who needed medical attention sought outpatient medical treatment and have since recovered. None of the students were hospitalised. On 20 February 2025, SFA, together with the Ministry of Education (MOE), Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and food caterer SATS, decided to pause the FRPP until investigations on the SOTA gastroenteritis cases were concluded. At the same time, we also reached out to other recipient institutions to ascertain if there were other cases of related illness. Joint investigations by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and SFA are ongoing. As of 3 March, the total number of verified cases of gastroenteritis was 187, of which 184 were from schools, two were from Active Ageing Centres and one from a public agency. This constituted about 0.16% of the participants. All affected individuals have received the necessary medical attention and have since recovered. None were hospitalised. SFA has also collected samples of the meals for testing. The tests did not find any foodborne pathogens. SFA and MOH are conducting a comprehensive investigation of this incident, and SFA will take the necessary corrective and enforcement actions if lapses are detected. Members asked about the food safety processes applied to the supply of RTE meals. SATS, as an SFA-licensed establishment, is required to comply with food safety requirements and subjected to food safety inspections. Food safety requirements include ensuring that food preparation areas and process workflows are set up in a way that prevent cross-contamination between raw and cooked food, putting systems in place to ensure cleanliness and freedom from pest infestation, as well as having food workers certified with food safety training. SFA inspected SATS’ premises on 23 January 2025, prior to the start of the FRPP. The premises were found to be clean and no food safety violations were detected. SATS had also put in place additional measures for FRPP. Each meal produced under the FRPP was individually tested for leaks. Further, an SFA-accredited laboratory conducted sample microbiological testing to ensure food safety. Members asked about steps taken to restore public confidence in the safety of RTE meals used in resilience programmes. We agree that we need to restore public confidence in the RTE meals. As investigation is ongoing, it is too early to state the steps to take. SFA will conduct an after-action review to draw and learn from the lessons of this episode. SFA will continue to engage stakeholders, including schools, food businesses and community partners on our FRPP. Mr Speaker: Dr Tan. Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong): I thank the Minister for her comprehensive answer. I have Clementi residents who followed this news and were understandably concerned that there were reports of food poisoning in conjunction with certain RTE meals. I have got two sets of supplementary questions for the Minister. Firstly, based on media reports, these are ambient RTE meals, which means they were described as not requiring any special storage or refrigeration and could be eaten straight away. There were media reports that described the meals also as having real-time shelf-life studies. Can I ask as part of these shelf-life studies, under what kind of storage temperatures the testing was done to test the shelf-life? And did these storage temperatures reflect the variation that can happen when such meals are stored in the community for longer periods of time? Because weather can be warmer when these meals are being stored in a venue that may have sunlight coming from time to time, and so on? Secondly, can I also ask regarding the cases that have been found, were there any cluster effects, clustering of cases besides the one at SOTA, as that may help agencies understand if particular batches were affected, or if there may have been some other concurrent infection outbreak happening? Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: With regard to the first question about the conditions for testing, we believe that SATS had tested the RTE meals in the real-time, real case situations, simulating the transportation and storage conditions. But Dr Tan is absolutely right in the sense that these are the questions that SFA and MOH, together with SATS, will ask as we review the entire exercise. It is important for us to learn from this exercise, including some of the test conditions, to make sure that this programme will evolve more robust than before. As to the question of whether there was clustering, I think we are still getting the data. We would like to provide a fuller picture after we have gone through the data. Mr Speaker: Mr Yip Hon Weng. Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for her reply. I have two sets of supplementary questions. First is while the Ministry conducts regular inspections to ensure compliance with food safety regulations, can the Ministry clarify whether these audits encompass the entire supply chain of RTE food production, from ingredient sourcing to final delivery? And if certain stages are excluded, what are the reasons for these like omissions and how might they impact the overall safety of the food provided to Singaporeans? And secondly, to enhance public trust, is the Ministry considering making food safety violations by suppliers more transparent? For instance, will there be a public registry of food safety lapses or penalties imposed on suppliers? Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: On the first questions about inspection and food safety, indeed, SFA conducts regular inspections. We have also, through the enactment of the Food Safety and Security Bill (FSSB) recently, enhanced the framework of ensuring food safety across all stages of supply of food – from importation to wholesaling to preparation to retail. Of course, if you look at the entire value chain, not all of them are of the same risk. So, we need to take a risk-based approach, scientifically-based approach to dedicate and focus our inspection resources, so that we are more effective in ensuring food safety as a framework. As to the RTE process, I have mentioned in my answer earlier on, we have inspected the premises before the FRPP and are satisfied with the outcome of the inspection. Also, as of today, our results have shown that there were no food-borne pathogens detected in the samples of the RTE meals. We do not want to draw any conclusion at this point in time. We want to do a fuller review and we will look at all possible causes of these gastroenteritis cases. On transparency, again, in the FSSB, there will be a new regime to ensure that our food establishments are licensed according to their readiness, according to the system that they have put in place. If they have many food infringements, they will be downgraded, they will be given more inspections audits along the way. So, our SFA officers will take a risk-based approach. If there has been infringements in the past, we will inspect more frequently. And by grading the caterers and food establishments, we are hoping to give that information, that transparency to buyers and consumers. Mr Speaker: Last supplementary question. Mr Dennis Tan. Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang): Can I ask the Minister how long will the review or the investigation take? Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: I think that we are working as quickly as we can. In the meantime, we have suspended this programme. The RTE meals are actually isolated and controlled, so we do not see that going into the public. So, there is no urgency from a food safety point of view. The packages are all collected, so we are not continuing with this programme for the time being. [Please refer to \"Clarification by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment\", Official Report, 4 March 2025, Vol 95, Issue 157, Correction By Written Statement section.] We will do our best to do a study quickly, but more importantly is to get ourselves ready for the next programme. We have to learn and take positive lessons from this programme. How do we get Singapore to be ready to be resilient to disruptions? And the disruption is not just in food supply. What if we lack the facilities to cook food? How can we continue to provide nutritious food to the population in large numbers and in a way that is palatable to the population? This is in no means a small undertaking. We will have to learn from this lesson. We are expected to learn from it and be better. So, we will do it in due course and in full readiness before our next roll-out of the programme. Value of Support Provided to Ubisoft Singapore and KPIs to Ensure Local Talent Development and Leadership Placements 4 Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the total amount of Government subsidies, grants and other financial support provided to Ubisoft Singapore from 2008 to 2024; (b) what specific key performance indicators and conditions are attached to the support provided in terms of local talent development, leadership roles for Singaporeans, and knowledge transfer; and (c) what mechanisms exist to claw back subsidies if companies fail to meet these conditions. The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry): Mr Speaker, the Government has a suite of economic incentives and tools to attract investments, and support companies to grow and transform their businesses. Companies that receive Government support are required to meet key outcomes, such as job creation and local employment, business spending, or fixed asset investment. The level of support and conditions vary depending on the nature of the project. The Government has mechanisms to claw back subsidies from companies that fail to meet the imposed conditions. We are unable to disclose the details of agreements with individual companies due to confidentiality clauses and commercial sensitivities. Mr Speaker: Mr Giam. Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied): Sir, can I just ask the Minister of State some supplementary questions? What key performance indicators (KPIs) and conditions were attached to support in terms of local talent development, leadership roles for Singaporeans and knowledge transfer? And what are the mechanisms that he mentioned that the Government has to be able to claw back government funding if companies do not fulfil these obligations? And has the Economic Development Board (EDB) ever clawed back public funding given to foreign companies who do not fulfil their obligations? Mr Alvin Tan: Sir, I thank Mr Gerald Giam for his questions. As I mentioned, we cannot comment on individual company agreements. But I would say that for the claw-back mechanisms, companies may be subject to potential revocation of their existing incentives or claw back of its associated benefits in the event of breach of terms and conditions. But I wanted to assure the Member also that the Government ensures prudent administration of tax incentives through a rigorous process that includes those claw-back mechanisms but also a pre-approval evaluation and also regular monitoring. With regard to Ubisoft and the broader games sector, those are applied, but the Government has been supporting and, indeed, growing this ecosystem. With regards primarily to the question about building up local talent in this space, I thought it is useful to share a few nuggets. First, probably the Member knows, Ubisoft has been established for about 15 years. They have trained over 780 Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs). There are local leaders who have been developed, and I have met a few of them. Paul Foo is a creative director who has been working at Ubisoft for many, many years. I met with Justin Ng, who is a producer, and their teams produced a few titles, including the upcoming anticipated title, Assassin's Creed Shadows. They have also onboarded about 150 interns over the last 15 years and have been producing content. I talked about Assassin's Creed Shadows. The local team of Ubisoft Singapore and local developers have been working on the games in two regions, as the game is featured in Japan in the samurai era. So, they worked on the Omi and Wakasa regions. And over 80 Ubisoft Singapore developers and members were involved. Broader to that, recently I was also at Koei Tecmo Singapore's 20th anniversary. They launched Three Kingdoms HEROES, which is on Apple Arcade, and they also worked together with our local Institutes of Higher Learning, for example, with Nanyang Polytechnic. So, I met with some of the developers who are doing a diploma in animation games and visual effects. There are two, for example, Goh Jia Hui and Lu Shi Ya, have been working on these games that these studios have been developing and are based in Singapore. So, I think, overall, we support this ecosystem. We have also seen the good flow-down impact on creating very new and exciting jobs on the game developer space and we will continue to do so. Effect of Subject-Based Banding on Social Mixing in Schools 5 Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry is studying how effective subject-based banding, where secondary school students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their strengths, interests and learning needs, has been on social mixing in schools; (b) if so, what are the Ministry’s findings so far; and (c) if not, whether the Ministry will start studying this. The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong) (for the Minister for Education): Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) was implemented in secondary schools starting with the Secondary 1 cohort in 2024. Based on the experiences of students in Full SBB pilot schools starting in 2020, Full SBB has enabled secondary school students to interact more regularly with a more diverse group of students. Students spend around one-third of their curriculum time with peers of different academic profiles in mixed form classes during common subjects, such as Art, and Character and Citizenship Education. Students in these pilot schools reported that they had a wider and more diverse network of friends, as well as more positive attitudes towards peers from different backgrounds. School leaders and teachers also observed that their students are taking greater ownership of their learning and are more motivated to overcome challenges they face. We are heartened to see the early positive outcomes arising from the hard work by school leaders and teachers in implementing Full SBB, with the support of parents. The Ministry of Education (MOE) will continue to monitor the outcomes from Full SBB and provide the necessary support to schools and teachers. Mr Speaker: Mr Louis Ng. Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Sir, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. Could I just check specifically what indicators MOE is looking at in terms of studying the extent of social mixing as a result of SBB? Secondly, I know that SBB does increase the workload of teachers. The Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned about increasing resources to the schools. Could I check exactly what additional resources are provided to the teachers to help them with this? he Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong: I thank Mr Ng for the questions. On the Member's first question, there are several indicators. One of the indicators is looking qualitatively in terms of their networks and friends. When they are in Secondary 1 in their mixed form groups, how are they interacting and how are they engaging one another? And when they move to Secondary 2, do those friendships still persist inside and outside of their form classes? So, that is one of the key indicators. The rest are qualitative in terms of emotional feedback and surveys on how they find certain networks are useful. On the Member's second question, for example, for Full SBB, obviously, there is a more diverse curriculum and there are more movements. Schedules will definitely be a lot more robust and dynamic. That, certainly, has increased some of the workload and, invariably, teachers and schools will have to manage that. So, one way that we are doing it is looking at artificial intelligence, and technology and capability in how we can better do scheduling so that distance and travels will be less, less dynamism within the form classes and so on, so that there will be more time for the form teachers to spend time with some of their form class students as well. So, this is ongoing. Each school is monitoring their processes. It is slightly different, but we are monitoring that and we are getting feedback, and we will see what are some of the key technologies or processes that we can implement cohort-wide that could be accretive to this group. Mr Speaker: Dr Tan Wu Meng. Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong): Mr Speaker, I thank MOE for this move. On the topic of social capital and social network diversity, can I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary that for these studies, will MOE look at it much further into the future? That means looking at the cohort, not just as they progress through school but to the end of formal schooling, and even into the early years of working life, so that we can see how this lifts up children, not just at age 18, but even at 28 or 38 in the years ahead? Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong: I thank Dr Tan for the question, and it is a very important one, because these outcomes are indicative of whether a certain programme is important: social mixing, networks and diversity of friends. SBB has only been for a couple of years. So, this is something that we definitely want to put into it and study over the long term, and hopefully we get some longitudinal data from that. There will be a review every now and then, and we will most certainly provide updates then. Impact on COE Prices Resulting from Ban for Three Years on Sale of Vehicles Bought for Ride-hailing Services 6 Ms Mariam Jaafar asked the Minister for Transport in light of the new rule which requires businesses that acquire private-hire cars meant for ride-hailing services to keep them for three years before they can be converted or transferred to individuals to ensure a steady supply of ride hailing vehicles, whether a study has been done on the impact of the new rule on private-hire cars on the COE market and COE prices. Mr Speaker: Who is answering the question? Yes, Senior Minister of State Amy Khor. The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport): Actually, I was going to say that I want to thank the Member for her question. As I mentioned yesterday in my reply to Ms Hazel Poa's Parliamentary Question, the Ministry of Transport will be providing more details regarding the review of the point-to-point transport sector at the upcoming Committee of Supply debate. So, we will address the Member's question then. Percentage of Pedestrian Crossings with Bollards of Crash Test Standards 7 Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song asked the Minister for Transport (a) what percentage of pedestrian crossings have bollards of crash test standards, such as the International Workshop Agreement (IWA) 14-1 or American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F2656; (b) of these, what percentage withstands the equivalent of (i) ASTM F2656 K4 (6,800 kg at 48 km/h) (ii) K8 (6,800 kg at 64 km/h) and (iii) K12 (6,800 kg at 80 km/h) respectively; and (c) what other specific quantitative standards are applied. The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport): The bollards installed at pedestrian crossings by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) are not of the K4, K8 or K12 standards stated by the Member. Bollards of these standards are typically security bollards. They are installed to protect critical infrastructure or at high security areas, such as Changi Airport, to be unyielding. The bollards that LTA has installed at around 100 signalised junctions are safety bollards that help protect pedestrians waiting to cross the road. They are designed to balance absorbing the impact from a vehicle and not causing serious injury to passengers in the vehicle. In contrast, as security bollards are designed to withstand high impact collisions without yielding, when a vehicle hits a security bollard, the vehicle will likely suffer severe damage and the passengers in the vehicle risk serious or even fatal injury. Mr Speaker: Mr Gerald Giam. Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied): Sir, can I just clarify with the Senior Minister of State then whether she means that the bollards at pedestrian crossings are primarily meant as a visual guide to delineate traffic, or is it actually meant to stop, to protect the pedestrians? I understand she said that the bollards are meant to not cause serious injury to the drivers. But how about the pedestrians? Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan: First, let me say that the bollards, the ones that are at the bus stops as well as the signalised junctions at pedestrian crossings are designed to do both. Firstly, as I have said earlier, the bollards are designed to absorb the impact from the vehicle if the vehicle were to encroach into the pedestrian waiting area, for instance. That is to protect pedestrians waiting at the crossing. But at the same time, the vehicles may have passengers. So, we also want to balance this to make sure that we will minimise the risk of the passengers in the vehicles being seriously injured, unlike the security bollards where, due to the high impact collision and because the bollards are designed to be unyielding, that means for security bollards, they are unyielding. It means they will not move or break off. Whereas for the safety bollards, because we are balancing both the impact, protecting the pedestrians as well as the passengers in the vehicles, they absorb the impact. At the same time, they could break or fall off whilst absorbing the impact. At the same time, these bollards at the junction would also provide visibility. They will guide the motorist when they are turning. They will clearly delineate the passenger waiting area, the buffer area, as well as enhance visibility and, therefore, minimise or reduce the likelihood of these vehicles encroaching into the area. Mr Speaker: Mr Giam. Last supplementary question. Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song: Can the Senior Minister of State clarify then that will LTA educate the public to help them to understand that actually the bollards are not going to prevent a vehicle from colliding into them if the vehicle veers off the road? Because I think most members of the public or most pedestrians would reasonably expect that the bollards are actually going to protect them completely. But what the Minister is saying is that actually the bollards may fall over, and they might still be impacted by the vehicle. Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan: They will provide a certain amount of protection to the pedestrians because, as I have said, the bollards will absorb the impact of the collision from the vehicles. So, there is a protection. But ultimately, of course, road safety really depends on a multitude of factors, including road user behaviour. So, we need to encourage all road users, whether it is drivers or pedestrians, to act cautiously and to take responsibility. Let me also say that these bollards, although there are no specific international standards that such bollards have to comply with, for LTA, when we design the bollards, we take into account the design parameters, we do take reference from European standards like EN1317, regarding the road restraint systems on the containment level. Of course, these are also built with the steel and concrete structure in compliance with various standards that are an adaptation of the European standards. Mr Speaker: I think we can squeeze in one last Parliamentary Question. Update on Implementation of Recommendations by National Wellness Committee for Junior Doctors 8 Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he can provide an update on the implementation of the recommendations by the National Wellness Committee for Junior Doctors, including the (i) appointment of Chief Wellness Officers (ii) Hospital Clinician Scheme and (iii) Clusters pilot; and (b) what specific improvements have been seen in the work hours of junior doctors as a result of these recommendations. The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health): Mr Speaker, Sir, you are very optimistic. Mr Louis Ng has squeezed four substantive issues into one very long sentence. [Laughter.] Since our last update in Parliament in May 2024, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has made progress in implementing the recommendations of the National Wellness Committee for Junior Doctors. Each of our healthcare clusters has appointed Chief Wellness Officers. Our public hospitals have also designated wellness officers to better understand the concerns of their healthcare staff as well as to support their welfare and well-being. Sir, the Hospital Clinician (HC) Scheme has been rolled out in all our public hospitals. Currently, around 100 doctors have either enrolled in or been appointed to the HC scheme. These HCs will work alongside family physicians and specialists to deliver team-based care. Where appropriate, HCs may lead healthcare teams and be responsible for the care of patients under their charge. Since its introduction in 2020, we have refined the scheme to enable junior doctors to join earlier in their careers. Doctors now also have the flexibility to switch into the HC career pathway from other medical career tracks. In collaboration with our healthcare clusters, MOH has implemented pilots aimed at improving the work hours of our junior doctors. Through these pilots, we hope to identify best practices to share across our hospitals. To date, close to half of all clinical departments with junior doctors have implemented shift rosters or have limited their doctors to working no more than 24 hours continuously. This practice will be extended to more departments progressively as we expand our medical workforce. Mr Speaker: Order. End of Question Time. The Clerk will now proceed to read the Order of the day. [Pursuant to Standing Order No 22(3), provided that Members had not asked for questions standing in their names to be postponed to a later Sitting day or withdrawn, written answers to questions not reached by the end of Question Time are reproduced in the Appendix.] Estimates of Expenditure for the Financial Year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026 [(proc text) Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [3rd Allotted Day].

(proc text)] [(proc text) Question again proposed. (proc text)] The Chairman: Minister Josephine Teo. The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo): Mr Chairman, I thank Members for their support of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). My colleagues and I will address the points that they raised. Minister of State Sun Xueling will speak about our multi-pronged approach to tackle scams. Minister of State Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim will touch on our rehabilitative initiatives, including for drug abusers. I will provide an update on the Ministry's transformation for a future-oriented and trusted Home Team. Over the years, the Home Team has embarked on numerous transformation initiatives. Assoc Prof Razwana Begum asked about our progress. The Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority's (ICA's) New Clearance Concept (NCC), is one of our flagship transformation projects. It has enhanced Singapore's border security. Risk assessments can now be conducted ahead of the passengers' arrival, enabling ICA to better identify travellers with possible security or immigration risks. At the same time, with passport-less clearance at Changi Airport, the traveller experience has improved significantly. The traveller just has to face the screen, without needing to also scan the passport. Typically, it takes only 10 seconds for a traveller to clear immigration, which is 60% faster than before. NCC has also transformed the job of the ICA officer. They no longer spend most of their time opening, checking and stamping passports. With reskilling, they now perform higher value-added work to safeguard Singapore's borders, such as profiling travellers as they go through the automated lanes. In the past, each manual counter needed to be manned by an individual officer. Today, one ICA officer alone can oversee up to six automated gates. This has allowed ICA to reduce the number of officers deployed for existing immigration clearance duties by 250 persons, while saving the need for an additional 4,000 officers to cope with more travellers and new checkpoints, like the Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link and Changi Terminal 5. Sir, in every aspect, the Home Team faces new and growing demands. The threat landscape is increasingly complex. Criminals are exploiting technology, in particular, artificial intelligence (AI), to carry out more sophisticated crimes and to hit more victims. The manpower constraints are also more binding. Birth rates are declining and the competition for talent very tough. The Home Team departments have been reviewing and reprioritising operations, policies and other work. Despite these efforts, the pressures on the Home Team remains intense. Mr Zhulkarnain asked about the measures to deal with technology-enabled crime. To stay ahead, the Home Team has been taking bold steps to leverage technology in our mission, in particular, using AI against AI-enabled crime. Last year, the Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) launched the Home Team AI Movement to accelerate the development and delivery of AI capabilities across the Home Team. By end-2025, HTX will have hired and trained a 300-person AI workforce. We have started to use some of these AI solutions. One example is the Singapore Civil Defence Force's (SCDF's) Targeted On-site Inspection Tool, which is an AI model to assess the likelihood of fire safety violations in commercial and industrial premises, using data from various sources, including past inspection reports. The tool will be progressively rolled out to frontline units for field testing in the coming months. It will allow SCDF to optimise its resources, by carrying out inspections on a more targeted basis. Other than AI, the Home Team is also leveraging smart and autonomous solutions to detect threats earlier and respond faster. For example, Singapore Prisons is trialling the use of smart sensors in its medical wards and cells to monitor inmates' vital signs remotely. The system will enable Prison officers to respond more quickly to incidents, such as falls and abnormal heart rates, among the inmates. This is especially important with a growing pool of older inmates. As criminals adopt more advanced modus operandi, our criminal justice procedures and processes must also be more nimble and effective to deal with new types of cybercrime, as well as the increased speed and scale at which cybercrimes are being committed. We will continue to: review our laws, to ensure their ability to deal with traditional crimes committed in cyberspace; and strengthen our regulatory frameworks, to better leverage technology to combat cybercrimes. For example, with the rapid proliferation of websites that facilitate scams and other malicious cyber activities, the Government is considering how to use technology to autonomously disrupt such websites more rapidly. Let me say something about generative AI (Gen AI) and how it matters to the Home Team. Gen AI has the potential to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency, for us to better serve Singaporeans. But as with many other technologies, it comes with risks. First, risks of abuse. Just as the Home Team seeks to use Gen AI to improve our work, criminals are also abusing the same technology to prey on innocent victims. For example, scammers are exploiting Gen AI to produce fake content at speed and scale, and to target victims. They can also use it to manufacture evidence to mislead or frustrate investigators. We are therefore developing capabilities, to detect and identify AI-generated scams and falsified content. For example, AlchemiX, a Gen AI-powered algorithm, has been developed to identify whether audio or video recordings are genuine. Our capabilities must be backed by strong legislative frameworks. Under the Online Criminal Harms Act, once potential scam content is detected, directions can be issued to online service providers to prevent the content from reaching Singapore users. Designated online service providers are already required to implement measures to proactively disrupt online scams, including those facilitated by AI. We will continually assess if they need to do more. A second risk is when we use Gen AI to support decision-making. What if the model was trained using data that was illegally obtained? What if the model produces outputs that are biased against certain groups? These risks are not unique to MHA. We take them seriously and have put in place an AI Governance Framework to guide the implementation of AI projects and ensure compliance with our laws, such as ensuring fair, representative and responsible use of data. We will also put in place safeguards, including to ensure that there is an appropriate level of human intervention to act as a layer of checks and ensure accountability. In addition to these risks, Ms He Ting Ru highlighted AI-generated crime that are violent in nature. I agree with her that the risks to children and women are particularly concerning. We are thus moving quickly to deal with these risks robustly. To Ms He's question on the timeline for Penal Code amendments, we plan to table them in the second quarter of this year when the Bill is ready. More details will be announced in due course. As for the new legislation and agency to tackle online harms, I will be providing more information during the Ministry of Digital Development and Innovation's (MDDI's) Committee of Supply (COS) debate. While technological capabilities are important, they are not enough. We also need to ensure that Home Team officers are well-trained to use the technologies. As part of the Home Team AI Movement, HTX is developing an AI training roadmap to empower officers across all our agencies to use AI tools effectively. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) has also implemented a cybercrime competency framework to provide its officers with the skillsets to tackle rapidly-evolving cybercrimes. To Ms He's suggestion, I am pleased to share that training programmes have been provided to better support our Police officers in dealing with sexual crime cases. A training roadmap has also been implemented for officers managing sexual crime and family violence cases, to equip them with the necessary skills to handle these sensitive cases. Earlier, I spoke about our manpower challenges. One key area that has been significantly impacted is SCDF's Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Ms Mariam Jaafar asked how we are coping. Overall demand for EMS has increased by almost 30% over the last five years. We expect it to spike further as our population ages. SCDF has therefore expanded its recruitment pathways for EMS officers, including through the SCDF-Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Work-Study Diploma. This is in Paramedicine and it offers applicants an opportunity to begin a career with SCDF while pursuing a diploma. To recognise, develop and retain deep expertise in the EMS domain, SCDF also introduced the Paramedicine Expert Track. The first batch of 16 senior specialists will be appointed on 1 April. They will enable SCDF to build domain knowledge in the EMS field, mentor junior paramedics and improve EMS protocols. In recognition of their expertise and additional contributions to SCDF, the senior specialists will receive an additional allowance. Despite these efforts and more competitive salaries, local recruitment is insufficient to meet all our needs. This is because EMS roles require advanced medical skills that are in short supply locally. Also, EMS work, although very fulfilling, is very challenging and may not appeal to all. Starting this month, we will supplement local recruitment with applications from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) nationals. All new recruits, regardless of nationality, will undergo rigorous training and accreditation, including to obtain the necessary professional qualifications, in accordance with SCDF's standards. This is to ensure that SCDF continues to deliver the highest standards of emergency medical services to Singaporeans. At the same time, SCDF will continue to focus on recruiting Singaporeans, to maintain a strong local core. Last January, we also shared in Parliament that MHA may allow our Auxiliary Police Forces (APFs) to recruit foreign Auxiliary Police Officers (APOs) from more sources. As of December 2024, APOs have been recruited from five new sources – namely Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Philippines, India and China – and constituted about 3% of the total APO workforce. Singaporeans make up the majority of APOs and will remain so. To ensure that safety and security standards are not compromised, all APOs, regardless of nationality, must meet the physical, educational and probity requirements set by the Singapore Police Force. This includes passing security screening and the APO basic course. The APFs also ensure that the new APOs become familiar with Singapore's local context, cultural nuances and operating environment. Mr Zhulkarnain asked how we are updating our efforts to harness the support of the community in keeping Singapore safe and secure. In May last year, SPF launched the Cyber Guardians on Watch initiative, to enlist the help of the public to tackle cybercrimes. The Cyber Guardians receive advisories from the Police, for dissemination to their own networks and communities, to raise awareness of online scams and other cybercrimes. They also act as the Police's eyes and ears in the cyberspace and will alert the Police to any suspicious activity online. Since 1 January this year, more than 32,000 members have been helping to make cyberspace safer for Singaporeans. This is highly commendable. Overall, the Home Team has achieved good outcomes for our people. These are reflected in how Singaporeans view the Home Team positively and hold our officers in high regard. In the 2024 SPF Public Perception Survey, 97% of the respondents said they trusted the Police and that they would provide information or assistance to the Police if there was a need. Many have also stepped forward to volunteer and assist in our crime prevention efforts. These attitudes are indicative of a high level of trust between the public and the Home Team, which as Mr Zhulkarnain mentioned, is lacking in many other jurisdictions. We will continue our efforts to build understanding and trust with the public. Mr Chairman, with your permission, I would like to conclude my remarks in Mandarin. (In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Mr Chairman, as society's demands on the Home Team continue to grow and evolve, we must strengthen the use of technology, develop talent and work closely with the community to enhance the Home Team's effectiveness and efficiency. Only then can Singapore maintain our reputation as one of the safest countries in the world, and ensure that our people continue to live and work in peace. It is heartening that the Home Team enjoys a high level of public trust. We will continue to drive transformation and fulfil our commitment to fellow Singaporeans. The Chairman: Minister of State Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim. The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim): Mr Chairman, I will now speak on the drug situation. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported that 190 tonnes of methamphetamine were seized in East and Southeast Asia in 2023, a 26% jump from 2022. This amount is almost 8,000 times the amount seized in Singapore that year. Drug abuse threatens public safety and impacts innocent victims, as those under the influence of drugs may resort to crime to feed their habit, or commit violence against others. Even though Singapore's drug situation is under control, we still have drug-related crimes. We are an attractive market for drug traffickers. Our purchasing power means that the street price of drugs in Singapore can be many times higher than in other countries, allowing traffickers to reap massive profits. Singapore has in place tough laws and effective enforcement to curb drug supply. More importantly, we also focus on reducing demand through, firstly, creating strong public awareness of the harms of drugs through preventive drug education (PDE); and secondly, helping drug abusers turn over a new leaf through evidence-based rehabilitation. This approach has proven effective. In 2024, about 3,100 drug abusers were arrested, similar to 2023. Mr Vikram Nair pointed out that the number of young drug abusers is on the rise. In 2024, 156 youths below the age of 20 were arrested for drug abuse, up from 132 in 2023. This is an area of concern for us. Mr Nair and Ms Mariam Jaafar ask how we can inoculate youths against the harms of drugs. We will continue to expand our PDE efforts. The Inter-Ministry Committee on Drug Prevention for Youth will focus on the following areas. First, strengthening our network of over 1000 DrugFreeSG champions, comprising of educators, counsellors, youths and healthcare workers who help disseminate drug-free messages in the community. We will enhance their skills and knowledge with training. In March 2025, we will organise a DrugFreeSG Champions Conference to equip the DrugFreeSG Champions with insights on drug matters. Second, continuing to promote anti-drug awareness through the Drug Victims' Remembrance Day. The inaugural Remembrance Day held last year had a very good turnout and over 100,000 pledges to be drug-free were logged. I am happy to announce that Remembrance Day 2025 will be held on 16 May and commemorated with a main observance event and exhibition. We will also continue collaborating with schools and parents. All schools will continue to conduct at least one PDE programme annually. The Ministry of Education (MOE) will work with the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) to invite Parent Support Group leaders to participate in capability building sessions on drug-related topics and will continue making PDE resources available for all parents on the Parents Gateway Portal. Besides preventing drug abuse among the young, it is also important to rehabilitate drug abusers to wean off their drug addiction. To this end, CNB piloted the \"Supervision 2.0\" regime in January 2024 for ex-drug abusers who are placed under supervision upon release from Drug Rehabilitation Centres. Under this pilot, hair analysis tests are used as the default monitoring mechanism for CNB's supervisors, as it can detect drug abuse over a longer period compared to urine tests. Supervisees can then report to the reporting centre less frequently, reducing disruption to their daily lives. Assoc Prof Razwana Begum also asked how we can prepare ex-drug abusers for successful re-integration. Under Supervision 2.0, supervisees will undergo Community Supervision Sessions where the CNB supervision officer will check in on the supervisee's well-being, the progress of interventions and assess the supervisee's residual re-integration needs. CNB can then refer the supervisees to the appropriate agencies for support, such as for assistance with housing or employment. The preliminary findings from the pilot are positive. CNB was able to swiftly detect more supervisees who had relapsed via hair tests as compared to under the urine supervision regime, due to the longer detection windows for hair tests. About two-thirds of the supervisees rated the scheme as \"very helpful\" in their re-integration. CNB will fully operationalise Supervision 2.0 in phases, with the aim of emplacing all supervisees on this regime by 2026. I will now move on to other rehabilitation and re-integration efforts for inmates and ex-offenders, which Mr Patrick Tay, Assoc Prof Razwana and Ms Jean See have filed cuts on. Assoc Prof Razwana asked how these efforts account for the specific needs of female drug abusers. Prisons incorporates trauma-informed practises in their psychology-based correctional programmes for all women inmates. These programmes teach inmates to replace unhealthy ways of coping with past trauma, like drug abuse, with techniques to regulate their emotions. These programmes have been effective. The two-year recidivism rates for women have decreased significantly, from 48.6% for the 1990 release cohort, to 13% for the 2022 cohort. Prisons currently works with 20 family-focused partners to deliver structured family programmes, benefiting more than 3,000 inmates and families. Prisons is conducting a trial of the Family Engagement model, which aims to strengthen the ability of inmates and their family in building and maintaining relationships through family re-integration programmes. Inmates will also attend support group sessions led by community partners and peer supporters who had completed the programme. This allows inmates to shift their identity away from being offenders to being role models. Since 2022, Prisons has collaborated with schools to pilot Project Hope, in which video visits are conducted between incarcerated parents and school-going children. This initiative allows inmates to stay involved in their children's lives and understand their progress in school. Project Hope has 18 cases, with 14 schools involved. The pilot participants have experienced improvements in their relationships and the schools have also observed positive changes in the students' behaviour and emotional well-being. Prisons is working with MOE to expand Project Hope to more schools. To better prepare inmates for release, Prisons established the Re-integration Hub in September 2024. The centralised facility allows Prisons to better implement targeted re-integration-centric programmes. for suitable inmates, such as those emplaced on community-based programmes prior to release. The Re-integration Hub provides easier physical access for community partners and volunteers to support the inmates. They need not travel to separate prison institutions on separate occasions. The Hub has also implemented pre-emplacement programmes, which include sharing sessions with desistors, to provide motivation and encouragement. At steady state, about 550 inmates and supervisees will be housed at the Re-integration Hub. We will also equip inmates with relevant skills to navigate an increasingly digitalised world, which can impede re-integration. The Access for Inmate Digital Experience (AIDE) is a new initiative to allow inmates to familiarise themselves with, and independently access citizenry e-services, such as those provided by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board, and the Housing and Development Board (HDB), during incarceration. Since its start in September 2024, more than 400 inmates have benefited from AIDE. Another pillar of our re-integration strategy is to equip ex-offenders with market-relevant work skills. Ms See asked what more we can do in this regard. Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) will be enhancing its career facilitation efforts, in particular to assist ex-offenders attain their career goals. This includes refining \"Career Circles\", which was piloted in 2023. The \"Career Circles\" programme comprises facilitated sessions on various career-related topics, such as career planning and addressing common workplace challenges. Inmates are equipped with the skills to set career goals and prepare for job searches. The enhanced version of \"Career Circles\" with a revised curriculum and frequency was implemented from February 2025. Mr Tay asked if the spent regime for criminal records could be reviewed to further support ex-offenders. MHA periodically reviews the spend regime for criminal records. An ex-offender could have his offence spent as early as five years, if he or she stays crime-free during this period and fulfils the criteria set out in the Registration of Criminals Act. Our current assessment is that the criteria and regime remain appropriate in striking the balance between the interest of the ex-offenders, employers and society at large. Assoc Prof Razwana asked how partnerships with social services and the broader community can complement MHA's rehabilitation and re-integration efforts. The Community Action for Rehabilitation of Ex-offenders Network (CARE Network) was formed in May 2000 by an alliance of 10 core members, comprising Government organisations and social service agencies. It has since expanded to coordinate the efforts of over a hundred community partners. In 2023, more than 16,000 beneficiaries benefited from the services provided by CARE Network agencies, such as financial assistance and skills training. I offer my congratulations to the CARE Network, which will be celebrating its 25th anniversary this year and will be unveiling its work plan for the next five years. The network has provided an invaluable service to society in assisting and transforming the lives of ex-offenders. Prisons and YRSG also work with more than 4,200 volunteers to address the rehabilitation and re-integration needs of both inmates and ex-offenders. Over 6,700 employers have also partnered with YRSG to hire ex-offenders, which is an almost 20% increase from 2021 to 2024. Prisons has enhanced its volunteer training framework, called \"Igniting and Maximising Partners' Agility for Correctional Transformation\" (IMPACT). IMPACT aims to develop the competencies of volunteers and community partners, by introducing structured and tiered training pathways. In 2024, more than 1,800 volunteers were trained under IMPACT. Assoc Prof Razwana asked how we can increase support for the halfway house regime. In 2024, our halfway house partners provided step-down support for more than 1,200 offenders. Building on these efforts, Prisons has introduced an enhanced Halfway House Service Model called HSM+ on 1 January 2025, which has onboarded 11 halfway houses. Under HSM+, supervisees will undergo a longer duration of aftercare support. Halfway house staff will be equipped with skills to work effectively with different profiles of supervisees. Infrastructural works will also be carried out to improve accessibility for those with mobility issues. I will now speak in Malay on the role of Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) in our rehabilitation efforts. (In Malay): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Sir, MHA collaborates with various Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMO) to provide relevant support to our Malay/Muslim community. In 2024, CNB launched a new grant in collaboration with MUIS. This grant will provide a source of funding for mosques to organise programmes that support prevention of drugs efforts (PDE) under the DrugFreeSG and “Dadah Itu Haram” campaigns. Ten such events have been organised, including the Anti-Drug Forum run by the Hasanah Mosque for parents and youths. Our MMO partners also continue to actively strengthen their relationship with one another, in order to build a strong network to support offenders and ex-inmates. The MMO Rehabilitation Network was established in November 2021 to enable our MMOs to benefit from each other’s strengths and capabilities. MHA will continue to collaborate and work with our MMO partners to strengthen support for those in need within our community, including families and youths-at-risk, as well as offenders and ex-inmates who lack family support. (In English): Sir, we will also enhance engagement with our Indian community partners to support the rehabilitation and re-integration journey of Indian inmates, ex-offenders and their families. We will improve recruitment of volunteers through engaging organisations with extensive networks, such as SINDA. We will also work with community partners to streamline training for new volunteers involved in providing faith-based counselling. In addition, Prisons will develop a directory of rehabilitation programmes and services to enhance awareness of resources available in the Indian community. This will facilitate inter-agency coordination to enable agencies to better meet the beneficiaries' needs. I will move on to address Members' cuts on road safety. Mr Pritam Singh asked how we can improve public participation in our road safety efforts, such as encouraging the reporting of dangerous driving practices. We urge the public to report traffic violations via our e-Feedback on Road User portal. We have observed a consistent upward trend of such reports since the portal's introduction. Mr Singh suggested providing financial incentives for reporting traffic violations. However, this may lead to false or exaggerated reports for financial gain. Mr Singh suggested re-introducing speed warning lights on the top of commercial vehicles. Those lights were mandated of light goods vehicles in the early 1980s. Since April 2001, such lights were no longer required by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) due to feedback that they increased the overall height of the vehicle, causing accessibility issues into carparks, which was both an inconvenience and safety hazard. On balance, we do not think we should re-introduce such lights. We will instead rely on other means of detecting speeding vehicles, such as more speed cameras. Ms Sylvia Lim asked if the licence renewal process for seniors could be improved. Currently, two letters are sent – 10 weeks and four weeks before the driver's 65th birthday, to remind them to complete the necessary procedures. If they have not done so by their 65th birthday, their licence ceases to be valid, and the Traffic Police sends them a third letter. The third letter will inform the drivers to submit their medical report within three years to reinstate the licence, failing which, they would have to apply anew for a licence, including going through the various tests. We believe the current process provides sufficient notice and time to the driver to comply with the requirement. In 2024, the Traffic Police redesigned the notification letters to use visual aids, making it easier for seniors to understand what they need to do. Ms Sylvia Lim also asked if the medical examination requirement for seniors to renew their licence can be deferred to a later age. Any increase in the age at which a medical examination is required would need to take into consideration the possible adverse impact on the safety of other road users. We do not plan to do so at this time. Before I end, let me also address Mr Derrick Goh's cut on mitigating the fire risks posed by Active Mobility Devices, or AMDs. The Active Mobility Fire Safety Taskforce, co-chaired by LTA and SCDF, launched the \"Be Device-Safe\" programme in 2023. The programme educates users of motorised AMDs the risk of AMD-related fires and how to safely procure, use, maintain and dispose of such devices. In September 2024, we unveiled a refreshed campaign with new visuals. SCDF will also continue to disseminate advisories on AMD fires via social media and mainstream media. The Ministry of Transport's (MOT's) COS debate will further address enforcement measures against AMDs. Sir, it is incumbent upon us all to ensure a safe and secure Singapore. Last year, we encouraged Members of this House to show your support by wearing the green-and-white ribbon for a drug-free Singapore and the yellow ribbon for giving second chances to ex-offenders. This year, we seek your continued support by wearing the ribbons again, which can be collected at the Parliament Library. The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Sun Xueling. The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling): Mr Chairman, scams are a huge concern globally, as they are in Singapore. We have been fighting the scourge of scams for several years now. We have progressively strengthened our defences, from enhancing banking apps to be malware-resistant, to blocking calls from known scam numbers and labelling SMSes that are likely to be scams. In 2024 alone, SPF disrupted more than 150,000 scam-related mobile and WhatsApp lines, websites and online accounts. Nonetheless, the total amount lost to scams hit a new high of $1.1 billion last year, a 70% increase from 2023. Many people are rightly very concerned about this and so is the Government. We must and we will redouble our efforts in this fight against scams. We are up against highly organised and sophisticated criminal networks. Most of them are based outside Singapore. They are well-resourced, adept at using technology and constantly evolve their tactics to evade our defences. The Government will continue to respond aggressively to this challenge. The significant majority of scams right now involve self-effected transfers, where victims were manipulated into willingly transferring monies to scammers. This accounts for more than 80% of scam losses last year. In many cases, victims thought they were transferring money to friends, Government officials, e-commerce sellers or for legitimate investment opportunities. Gone are the days when we could easily spot a scam call or email, through heavy foreign accents or bad English. Today, scammers use AI and information about us online, among other capabilities, to make themselves more believable and evade easy detection. Fundamentally, these scams are successful because they prey on universal human emotions, such as a desire for companionship, respect for authority, and greed. In some cases, the victims are so convinced by the scammers that they refuse to believe that they are being scammed, despite being repeatedly advised by their loved ones and the Police. By the time they come around, it is oftentimes too late. That is why we introduced the Protection from Scams Bill in January 2025, to empower the SPF to temporarily restrict the banking transactions of an individual who is likely being scammed but refuses to believe it. This is a serious measure. It shows how far the Government is going to tackle the issue of scams involving self-effected transfers. It will only be used as a last resort, after all efforts to convince the individual have failed. We are glad that most members of the public understand this and support it. In addition, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is working with banks to introduce cooling-off periods for high-risk transactions, such as requests to increase transaction limits or to change contact details. These cooling-off periods provide a cognitive break for individuals and give them an opportunity to reassess their actions. The cooling-off period also gives authorities more time to detect if something suspicious is taking place and to stop any scam transactions. These moves build on the suite of anti-scam measures which MAS has been working with the banks to put in place over the years, such as Money Lock, Kill-Switch and enhanced fraud surveillance to alert victims and block scam transfers. Collectively, they underscore the critical role that banks play in our fight against scams. We will continue to proactively strengthen our defences. One priority is to improve the authentication methods that banks use to protect accounts against malware and phishing. Since July 2024, the major retail banks in Singapore have progressively phased out the use of SMS One-Time Password (OTP) for account logins by customers who have digital tokens. Digital tokens are more secure against phishing. We are also studying stronger authentication solutions, such as the use of Fast IDentity Online-compliant hardware tokens, otherwise known as FIDO, which need to be in close proximity to the user's device to authenticate the transaction. This will fortify our defences against malware and phishing. As we have strengthened our protection of bank accounts, scammers have pivoted their playbook. They have started asking victims to convert their money to cryptocurrencies prior to performing the transfers, thereby evading our banking safeguards. They have also targeted assets stored in victims' crypto wallets. In 2024, crypto-related scam losses accounted for close to 25% of all scam losses. This was up from less than 10% in 2023. Members will know that cryptocurrency is largely unregulated. In Singapore, MAS has licensed a number of digital payment token service providers with certain regulatory safeguards in place. We will work with these digital payment token service providers to strengthen anti-scam controls and tighten operational links with law enforcement agencies. But there are many other online exchanges and wallet providers which are not regulated and they are outside the reach of our laws because they operate from overseas. Furthermore, the anonymity features of certain cryptocurrency transactions can be exploited by criminals to evade capture. MAS has repeatedly cautioned retail investors against investing in cryptocurrencies. And I want to repeat this appeal today. I know some people are attracted because they think crypto is an opportunity for them to make a quick buck. They think that so long as they do their own research, they understand the risks, they would not lose money and they would not get scammed. My dear fellow Singaporeans, even crypto-savvy individuals have lost badly by trading in crypto when their values plummet or when they fall prey to scams. The single largest scam that occurred in Singapore last year involving $125 million, just one case, that was a malware-enabled scam that targeted the victim's cryptocurrency wallet. These sophisticated criminal syndicates are going after both crypto-novice and crypto-savvy investors. They invest in elaborate fake crypto trading interfaces to scam you into thinking that you are profiting from your crypto investments. Some embed malware or phishing links to drain your crypto wallets. Meanwhile, we have seen meme coin prices soar rapidly before crashing in pump-and-dump schemes, leaving consumers with significant losses. So, our advice to the general public is to steer clear of cryptocurrencies. The risk of getting burnt is high and, should you fall victim to a scam, the chances of you getting even a single dollar back is very low. Another common scam modality is scam calls and SMSes, which many of us are familiar with. About 20% of scam cases in 2024 involved victims being contacted in this way. We have been working to suppress scam calls and SMSes for some time. Telcos have allowed subscribers to block calls from international numbers and have pre-emptively blocked international calls with spoofed +65 prefixes. But scammers have pivoted to using local phone numbers to try to catch people unawares. That is why we have been taking measures to tighten the ownership and abuse of local SIM cards. Last year, to strengthen accountability for SIM cards, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) limited the number of post-paid SIM cards that a person can own. From 1 January this year, the Police have operationalised offences, including registering for a SIM card and then selling it for a gain, possessing a large number of unregistered SIM cards for no legitimate reason, and buying or selling SIM cards registered in another person's particulars. We take a very serious view of anyone who assists scam operations in this way. These \"SIM-card mules\" are not just abetting a crime. They are helping to destroy lives. That is the reason why such offences carry penalties of up to three years' imprisonment or a fine of $10,000 or both. We will not hesitate to use the full range of these penalties against people who abuse SIM cards. This is the same approach we have taken for money mules. We have been clamping down on them, because they are the main way that overseas scammers launder their ill-gotten gains and transfer monies out of Singapore. In 2024, SPF conducted 25 island-wide anti-scam enforcement operations, leading to the investigation of more than 8,000 money mules and scammers. More than 660 have been charged in Court and they face imprisonment if found guilty. In one concluded case, a money mule received RM$1,000 for sharing access to his Internet banking account with another person, without taking reasonable steps to ascertain the purpose of this arrangement. The bank account was then used to launder more than S$160,000 of criminal proceeds. The money mule was convicted and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. Mr Vikram Nair asked if there is more we can do to better detect money mule activity. For 2025, we will be expanding our efforts on this front. The SPF will expand information sharing with the banks on known mule accounts, to enhance banks' fraud analytics and enable banks to uncover other mule accounts. We will also work with the industry to implement cooling-off measures for certain activities which are tell-tale signs of money mule activity. To those who think that they can make an easy profit by passing on their SIM cards or bank accounts to strangers and turning a blind eye to what they are used for, let me be very clear. This is a crime and there is an imprisonment term for passing on your SIM cards or your bank accounts to facilitate scams. Claiming ignorance does not get you off the hook. Mr Vikram Nair and Dr Tan Wu Meng asked if the penalties for scam-related offences are still too soft, with Dr Tan suggesting that caning should be legislated for egregious offences. I agree with Mr Nair and Dr Tan that we need stiff and deterrent sentences against those who facilitate scams. The Sentencing Advisory Panel (SAP) has recently proposed significant imprisonment terms for offences which facilitate scams. In the cases that have been prosecuted since these guidelines were published, the Courts have generally imposed jail terms, including 19 months' imprisonment, in one case. We will consider Dr Tan's suggestion for caning to be prescribed for certain scam-related offences, recognising the serious harm they can cause. We will do what we can to deter and disrupt scam activity. But at the end of the day, persistent scammers will find a way to reach Singaporeans. So, what Singaporeans want to know is: how can I protect myself? Assoc Prof Razwana, Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Mr Derrick Goh all had ideas on how we can better educate the public to deal with scams. They are useful suggestions and we will consider them. My advice to Singaporeans is to use the ScamShield Suite, which was launched in September last year. It comprises the ScamShield app, a helpline, website, as well as WhatsApp and Telegram alert channels. The public can use these various channels to easily, one, check if something is a scam; two, report scams; and three, stay updated on scam trends. If you are unsure if something is a scam, or you think you are being scammed and want to know what to do, call 1799 which is the ScamShield hotline. Meanwhile, we will alert Singaporeans to high-loss scam types through monthly media campaigns. These campaigns are tailored to the population segments which are most vulnerable to each scam type. There is one critical area which we can do better in and, that is, our online space. Today, 60% of scams occur through messaging apps and social media platforms. We can and we must do much more to prevent such scams from happening. As Mr Derrick Goh and Assoc Prof Razwana pointed out, achieving this will require close collaboration with tech companies. On the Government's part, we have put in place two Codes of Practice under the Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA), the Online Communication Code and E-Commerce Code. These require designated online services, such as messaging apps, social media platforms and e-commerce platforms to implement measures to proactively prevent and disrupt scams. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, Mr Keith Chua and Mdm Mariam Jaafar asked if messaging apps and social media platforms have been cooperative. They have generally been responsive to the legal requirements under OCHA. For example, as part of the E-commerce Code, Meta has implemented enhanced verification against Government-issued records for select sellers on Facebook Marketplace and advertisers on Facebook. Carousell has done the same for risky sellers on its platform. This has made it more difficult for scammers to exploit these platforms. For instance, after implementing enhanced verification for six months in 2024, the number of e-commerce scams decreased by about 10% on Carousell, and by about 60% on Facebook Marketplace. We thank Meta and Carousell for working with the Government on this and protecting users. The success of these efforts underscores a simple but powerful truth: robust user verification by online platforms deters online crime as criminals know that they cannot hide behind the cloak of anonymity. We strongly encourage all online platforms, including social media platforms and messaging apps, to put in place robust user verification measures, in particular, checking against Government-issued identity documents. Email addresses and phone numbers are no longer sufficient as verification methods, as they are prone to abuse. One platform we are especially concerned about is Telegram, which has long prioritised, and even prided itself in, the anonymity that it provides its users. This anonymity is exploited by scammers and other criminals. Drugs are being sold on Telegram. Sexually explicit non-consensual videos are being circulated on Telegram. Specifically on scams, the number of reported scams on Telegram close to doubled in 2024. We urge Telegram to take the online safety of its users seriously and adopt stronger user verification measures to prevent scammers from creating scam accounts. MHA is monitoring the situation closely and we will explore further measures to address the scam situation on Telegram, including making use of our legislative levers to ensure compliance. That aside, we continue to track the worrying trend of Government official impersonation scams, including on social media accounts. We have been engaging social media platforms to remove these, including through OCHA take-down directions. But as Mdm Jaafar has highlighted, these scams still persist. Our view is that social media companies can do more to put in place preventive measures. We are studying potential regulatory levers to better safeguard our online space on this front. Meanwhile, we will double down on our efforts to developed AI tech solutions to deal with scams that can be pushed out at speed and scale, as Mr Derrick Goh has pointed out. Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) have co-developed the Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS) suite of products, which leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to help the Police detect, assess and disrupt scam websites and accounts swiftly. We are expanding SATIS to disrupt other scam enablers, such as payment channels and mobile numbers. Thus far, I have spoken about the steps we will take to strengthen our defences here in Singapore against scams. Mr Derrick Goh, Mr Vikram Nair and Assoc Prof Razwana have asked how we can better act against scam operators outside of Singapore and improve asset recovery. Singapore works closely with foreign law enforcement agencies on joint operations against scam syndicates. For example, SPF participated in INTERPOL's Operation HAECHI V last year. More than 1,600 subjects involved in scams were investigated and more than 5,100 bank accounts were blocked, resulting in the seizure of more than $54.8 million. In terms of crypto assets, more than $798,000 were seized, arising from the blocking of more than 1,000 crypto accounts. Apart from working through INTERPOL, we have also conducted operations directly with other countries. Asset recovery is also a priority for us. In October 2024, SPF formalised \"FRONTIER+\", an alliance with the anti-scam units of Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and Maldives, to step up asset recovery efforts collectively. Mr Chairman, I would like to conclude this segment of my speech with some comments in Mandarin. (In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Last year, investment scams, job scams and Government official impersonation scams were the three types of scams that caused the most significant losses. These scams succeeded primarily because scammers prey on human vulnerabilities, such as the desire for companionship, respect for authority and greed. Some victims are so convinced by the scammers that they refuse to believe that they are being deceived, even after repeated warnings from family members and the Police. As for victims who repeatedly ignored warnings, we introduced the Protection from Scams Bill in January this year, empowering the Police to temporarily restrict their bank transactions at short notice to protect their asset. Additionally, we have worked with banks to implement a “cooling off” period for high-risk transactions, such as the raising transaction limits and changing contact information, giving people an opportunity to pause, reflect and reassess their decisions. This also gives the authorities more time to identify suspicious activities and prevent fraudulent transactions. This is an additional measure to protect bank deposits beyond our basic existing protective measures. These basic measures include the Money Lock, Kill-Switch features and the fraud monitoring system. This can promptly alert scam victims and stop fraudulent transfers. Meanwhile, we are taking strict actions against criminals who misuse local SIM cards for scams. They try to evade the law by claiming that they are unaware of how their SIMs were used, but this excuse will not absolve them of responsibility. Additionally, 660 people have been charged for acting as money mules and scammers. According to the Sentencing Advisory Guidelines, those who negligently surrender the control of their bank accounts to others will face at least a six-month imprisonment. Fighting scams requires collective efforts. People should use existing resources to protect themselves, such as the Money Lock feature, and protect their bank deposits and obtaining anti-scam information through ScamShield. When in doubt, they can also call ScamShield hotline 1799. Let us all work together to prevent scams, protect ourselves and care for our family members. (In English): Let me now address the queries that Members have raised on matters beyond scams. Mr Patrick Tay asked about additional safeguards in the law to better protect healthcare workers in the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and other mental health facilities. Let me assure him that we take abuse or harassment of our healthcare workers seriously. Under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) and the Penal Code, those who harass or physically abuse our public sector healthcare workers can be imprisoned for up to three years, or fined up to $5,000, or both. We have reviewed this over the years to strengthen our laws on this front. I understand that the Police and IMH are in discussions to better coordinate responses to such incidents. Meanwhile, MOH is working with our public health institutions to put in place measures to safeguard our healthcare workers. Mr Zhulkarnain asked for an update on our efforts to level up the security industry to become more productive and less manpower-intensive. A critical enabler for this is Outcome-Based Contracting (OBC), which allows and incentivises security agencies to innovate and adopt more productive solutions. The Government has been taking the lead in OBC since May 2020. As of 2024, I am pleased to note that all Government procuring entities have either adopted or called tender for at least one OBC at the agency level. We hope this will encourage more of the private sector to follow suit. This will complement other measures, such as subsidising the adoption of technology solutions and raising the competencies of the security agencies. Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Alex Yam asked about the threats to racial and religious harmony in Singapore. As a small, open and globally connected country, we are vulnerable to external influence. Religious extremism and far-right extremist ideologies have inspired some Singaporeans to consider violence and even plan attacks. Foreign events also have the potential to arouse local sentiments and polarise our society along racial and religious lines. This is why we agree with Mr Zhulkarnain and Mr Alex Yam that countering such threats requires a whole-of-society effort. We collaborate with our community partners, which include religious organisations, schools and hospitals, to enhance our ability to prevent, detect and respond to terror attacks. Beyond community engagement, our laws and policies protect our common civic space. The Maintenance of Racial Harmony Bill that was introduced this year clearly defines the boundaries of acceptable conduct in our multiracial society and gives us levers to act to protect our country’s racial harmony when it is threatened. But this will not be enough. We cannot legislate people to get along or integrate with one another. Maintaining our social stability and cohesiveness will require our collective effort. It is about how each of us conducts ourselves in the common space, whether we take the trouble to appreciate and celebrate one another’s differences and recognise the value that we each bring to our society. The Chairman: We have time for clarifications. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang): Chairman, I have two sets of clarifications for Minister Josephine Teo and Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim. For the Minister, on our Home Team Manpower Resource, firstly, regarding recruitment and training of locals while Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) expands its Emergency Medical Services (EMS) workforce and aims to maintain a local core, what are the strategies by the Home Team to recruit and train more Singaporeans and work together possibly with our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) or mid-career switches so that SCDF will remain a career of choice in the face of growing competition for talent? Secondly, on the foreign manpower part, what measures are being taken to ensure that the foreign EMS personnel receive the relevant training and qualifications that are needed for their roles in Singapore? Thirdly, on augmenting Home Team workforce with technology, I know we are using smart and autonomous solutions more increasingly. However, I feel that the Home Team also needs to increase public awareness on the deployment of these solutions to instill confidence and assurance in public that, while there is no visible officer, that does not mean that there is no security and vigilance. This is also important for deterrence. So, what steps are being taken to raise this awareness? For Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim, on the Re-integration Hub initiative – full disclosure – I am a member of the Yellow Ribbon Singapore. I love the work of the Re-integration Hub. Can the Minister of State share more about the Re-integration Hubs and their role in supporting desistors before their release? How many hubs are there and where are they located within the towns? And what kind of a response have we been getting from external stakeholders when they contribute to this cause? Finally, re-integration is a collective effort. So, together, not just with stakeholders, with prison or the Home Team, but also with the families. So, what efforts are there that we can encourage families to play a more active role in the re-integration process of the desistors? Mrs Josephine Teo: Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Zhulkarnain for his very important questions. Perhaps, I will take the third one first, in which he correctly pointed out that even as we are using technology more to support our operations, we need to help the public understand how these technologies are deployed in support of our efforts. Zhulkarnain I think we have been fortunate in the sense that when we rolled out the network of closed-circuit television (CCTVs), or what is referred to as PolCams in general, we saw a very positive response in our neighbourhoods. Today, if we were to ask people whether they see the usefulness of this CCTV network in detecting and solving crimes, the response level will be very positive. In fact, in our latest public perception survey, nine in 10 Singaporeans said that they see the value of these PolCams. I would say that if we take the question further and ask people what contributes to them feeling safe when they go out at night, for example, the top reason cited is often, again, the CCTVs. So, we have a situation where Singaporeans became sensitised to the usefulness of technology, and they saw it being deployed in a very tangible way and helping them. So, building on that sort of foundation, what Home Team agencies have done consistently is that whenever they have opportunities, they have events where there are public touchpoints, they will introduce the technologies that are being used. I have attended the workplan presentations of SCDF, as well as ICA, for example, where these technologies are exhibited. Media is invited to cover the events and, through the media, we get the word out on what is being used to carry out the Home Team's missions. We will continue to do so and find every possible opportunity to introduce the kinds of technologies that are being deployed in support of law enforcement. Perhaps, turning to the Member's two questions that are related to how SCDF seeks to strengthen its local core, as well as to ensure that its foreign hires are able to carry out its mission, first, let me deal with the strategies that we have put in place to ensure that SCDF careers remain attractive. The first is that the progression pathways have to be well laid out and they have to be attractive. So, one example is the new programme that we are working on with the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine to develop graduate certificates in advanced pre-hospital care. Of course, we have also regularly reviewed our salaries and these efforts are to ensure that SCDF careers remain attractive to locals. To the Member's second question, let me, first, say that we will always try and open up recruitment pathways and be willing to consider people of more varied backgrounds, as well as train them. One example is the diploma in paramedicine programme, which we are working with the PSB Academy on. This will double the annual intake at the diploma level. Our preference, of course, is always to recruit and train locals but, as Mr Zhulkarnain has alluded to, we must also balance this against the growing needs, because if we are not able to bring relief to the pressures that are faced by our officers, then, clearly, it could also compromise our ability to retain them. So, being able to supplement this with some foreign hires and to make sure that we are able to meet all of Singapore's needs, that is an avenue of support that we have gone towards as well. Now, let me assure Members of the training requirements that the foreign hires must meet. For example, they have to go through bridging and onboarding courses, and they will, even before they are deployed, be put on on-the-job ambulance attachments with local senior paramedics to ensure that they are well-assimilated and equipped to operate in line with SCDF's professional standards and protocols. The foreign hires will all be required to pass English language requirements to ensure that they can communicate clearly and effectively with patients and their families. All paramedics will also need to pass the paramedic specialist certification test and the ambulance proficiency test while emergency medical technicians will need to pass the SCDF Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) certification test before they are deployed. Upon deployment, the foreign hires will undergo certification tests annually, and continuous education as well as training will also be provided to them so that they can continue to fulfil the same requirements as the local hires. So, these are the suite of measures that we have put in place. The Chairman: Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim. Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim: I thank the Member for the supplementary question. There is only one Re-integration Hub. It is located at a centralised place at Institution S2. So, what we do is that we work with several partners looking at the needs of the desistors and also how they can help themselves when they are released. These areas include employment-related, skills-related areas as well, such as financial literacy and then also religious organisations and we also work with the community partners relating to family. The Member asked about family programmes. Like what I shared earlier, we have the Family Engagement Model that we are piloting and then we are working with many more partners today. But of course, we have the very basic programme that we work with the community, which is the Yellow Ribbon Community Project, which continues to bring in more support, and we have many more volunteers in place. So, the external stakeholders have found that centralised location facility to be useful. They go to one place and they are able to reach out. For the Prison Service, it is something that we find very heartening to see many partners coming on board and then, from here, we will be able to strengthen the ecosystem, all with the intention to help them to desist from offending and build up their lives again. The Chairman: Mr Pritam Singh. Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): I thank the Minister of State for responding to my cut. I have two clarifications. The first pertains to the online feedback portal on road users that the Minister of State referred to. It states on the site, and I quote: \"that it receives a large number of reports\" and therefore, the Traffic Police will not provide any updates on its findings, unless the feedback provider is required to testify in Court. I would like to enquire what is the policy reason behind this? Just informing a feedback provider that the feedback has been received, enforcement action has been taken, or there is insufficient evidence, does not seem to be too much of a requirement on the end of the Ministry. Because that feedback provider has taken the effort to download the video from ostensibly their recording devices and submitted that information to the authorities through the portal. Perhaps there is a policy reason which we are unware of or the public is unaware of as to why the TP cannot provide an update to the feedback provider. I think it would be helpful and would encourage greater civic consciousness. The second point pertains to the blinking amber light suggestion that I give. I thank the Minister of State for sharing the history behind the introduction of that light and the reason why it was eventually removed. In view of the Ministry of Transport's position last week in Parliament that banning the transport of foreign workers by lorries is not practical, in my view, there should be a stronger and renewed focus on ensuring their safe transport instead. And in that context, I hope MHA can reconsider my proposal more narrowly to incentivise the reporting of the unsafe transport of foreign workers as a pilot. And if there are indeed excessive, exaggerated fake reports then the pilot can be reviewed accordingly. And if the pilot is successful, then perhaps it can be expanded more generally to the most vulnerable of our road users and reporting unsafe road behaviour against them, specifically elderly pedestrians and motorcyclists. Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim: I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. For the second supplementary question, as I shared in my answer, we have the current levers which we feel are more effective in managing speeding and some of these aspects of enforcement actions that we are undertaking. So, we still feel that having speed cameras and also, our different aspects of reporting that are in place will help us to manage the traffic situation better today. And with regard to the first supplementary question, we feel that the current setting is sufficiently available to the community in making or contributing to this effort of reporting. The majority of people who report do not ask what happened or the actions being undertaken. So, we feel that this is a good balance, whereby what is key is about how we can play a part and getting the community to work with us to see how we can report such offences. I want to assure the Member that the TP will do their best to look through all the evidence. Today, when we have certain things happening, we not only get evidence from one road user, we sometimes get thousands of reports and the eyeballs there. In some instances, where many people are able to see, they use our system to share the incidents. So, essentially, we will continue to monitor the situation and how we can better navigate this to enhance community participation. The Chairman: Mr Patrick Tay. Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer): Sir, firstly, I would like to thank Minister of State Sun Xueling for looking into the better protection for healthcare workers, particularly SPF working with IMH. And hopefully, we get updates in due course. The other clarification is for Minister of State Faishal. He mentioned earlier about the volunteer impact training organised by the Prison Service, called IMPACT. Can we have more details about this new structured volunteer training framework? Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim: Sir, prior to IMPACT, we have the training framework called Developmental Framework for Offender Rehab Personnel (DORP). In place of DORP, we thought we could enhance the framework and as such, we came out with the IMPACT framework. It is a rebranding and at the same time, enhancement of the DORP framework. It introduces structured and tiered training pathways for various volunteer schemes. In Prisons' work, we have quite a few schemes. We are enhancing it in such a way that it is easier for us to provide training and also enhance the capability of our volunteers. Under IMPACT, we formalise our collaboration with the Social Service Institute, where the aim is to hone volunteer skills in befriending and how they can work with the inmates and their families. In addition to that, we have existing volunteers who we feel that many would benefit from a refresher course. And many of them have been with us for decades, where they have come forward to share and to really support the inmates, the ex-offenders and their families. So, with IMPACT, we are introducing e-refresher courses, where they are able to get themselves updated with new trends, some of the aspects where it will help them to understand the landscape better. This is one aspect that we do. And with IMPACT, we are able to provide more training spaces. For example, in 2024, we provided 3,200 training spaces. But with IMPACT, we can increase it to approximately 4,500 spaces per year. So, this is something that we feel will enhance the rehabilitation and re-integration journey of our inmates, our ex-offenders, and also help with supporting the families. The key thing about work in the prison ecosystem is that quite a big chunk of work is being supported by the community, so it is in the interest of the society, including the inmates, their families and Singapore that we enhance the capability so that they can do their role well, and support and provide the opportunities for our ex-offenders or desistors to build up their lives. The Chairman: We have time for one last clarification. Mr Vikram Nair. He raised his hand earlier. Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang): Thank you, Sir. My clarification is for Minister of State Sun. I thank her for answering my cut on scams and outlining the comprehensive range of measures. Specifically, the Minister of State highlighted that there were scams from Telegram and also other social media platforms, including Facebook, and Carousell has been used for scams. There is an online Code of Conduct that they have complied with, which has reduced the scams somewhat. Would the Ministry also consider potential legislation to require these platforms to address scams and potentially also have mechanisms for compensation of victims, if a platform is used to facilitate scams and they do not take adequate actions to prevent those scams? Ms Sun Xueling: I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. I had mentioned about the two codes of practices, namely one for the online communication services and the other for e-commerce services. These are both under the Online Criminal Harms Act. What they do, in the instance of online communication services is that they would specify what the platform should do, in the case of quick disruption of malicious accounts, for instance; or the deployment of safeguards, such as reasonable verification measures to prevent the creation and use of inauthentic accounts. In the case of the e-commerce code, I had also mentioned in my main reply that they have recommendations in the sense of subjecting users who advertise or post about the sales of the goods and services, for them to verify against Government-issued records, as well as to provide an option for users when it comes to payment protection mechanisms. These Codes of Practice are actually quite new, since June 2024, last year. And so, right now, between MDDI as well as MHA, we are working with the social media platforms and e-commerce players for them to implement these Codes of Practice. I have also shared that we have seen some early successes with Facebook Marketplace, as well as with Carousell. I have also indicated that we have seen losses in those areas for Carousell coming down by 10%, as well as for Facebook Marketplace coming down by 60%. [Please refer to \"Clarification by the Minister of State for Home Affairs\", Official Report, 4 March 2025, Vol 95, Issue 157, Clarification section.] So, we have seen improvements and we are trying to work off that base to expand the pilot to more categories of sellers who post their products and services online, and also, to see whether or not we can work with these platforms to increase the thresholds in what we mark as success – because I had talked about 10% and 60%. We see whether we can push those success rates higher. On the second question as to whether or not we want to consider whether or not these platforms should be made financially liable for losses that are sustained on their platforms, I think this is something that we can consider. But right now, what we are doing is that we are working on a good faith basis with these platforms, to tell them that we think that the measures that we have shared thus far – whether or not it is user verification, or whether or not it is in terms of the takedown timing, and so on and so forth – that these are the targets that we are aiming for, and please comply with these recommendations. If after this initial bout of working collaboratively with them, we see that there is no desire to work collaboratively with us, then I think we have to push what we can do with them one notch further. But right now, we are engaging with them when it comes to these Codes of Practice. With Telegram, unfortunately, it is a different story altogether. There are discussions internally as to what we should do with Telegram. We are not the only country that faces issues with working with Telegram. I had shared that they take anonymity on their platforms as a badge of honour, that works to the detriment of users. So, I think we are preserving some options now, thinking through, but if necessary, I think we will consider very serious actions against Telegram to ensure that they do not harm local citizens further. And this is not just in the case of scams, but also when it comes to the sale of drugs, the proliferation of sexually explicit non-consensual content online – I think we will have to consider all these harms that are prevalent on the Telegram channel. The Chairman: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin and Ms He Ting Ru, I am sorry, we have run out of time. So, I am going to invite Mr Zulkarnain Abdul Rahim, would you like to withdraw your amendment? Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim: Sir, I thank Minister Josephine Teo, Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim and Minister of State Sun Xueling for laying out the clear and comprehensive plans and priorities for MHA. On behalf of my fellow Parliamentarians as well, I extend our deepest gratitude to our MHA officers, men and women of the Home Team, and staff and Public Service officers, for their dedication and sacrifice in protecting our nation. With that, Sir, I seek leave to withdraw my amendment. [(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. (proc text)] [(proc text) The sum of $8,027,752,000 for Head P ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates. (proc text)] [(proc text) The sum of $1,247,341,500 for Head P ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates. (proc text)] Committee of Supply – Head R (Ministry of Law) The Chairman: Head R, Ministry of Law. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang): Chairman, I move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head R of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\" Chairman, I am a disputes lawyer in an international arbitration practice. Singapore has firmly established itself as a leading international dispute resolution hub, attracting parties from all over the world seeking a neutral, efficient and trusted venue for resolving their disputes. Our strategic location, strong rule of law and world-class legal institutions make us the preferred choice for businesses and investors navigating complex cross-border disputes. In 2022 alone, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) handled 357 new cases, with parties from over 65 jurisdictions. SIAC's caseload has grown steadily over the years, reflecting the confidence of the global business community. Similarly, the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC) has seen an increase in cases involving international parties, reinforcing our reputation as a trusted forum for commercial dispute resolution. Beyond arbitration and litigation, Singapore is also a leader in mediation. The Singapore Convention on Mediation, signed by more than 55 countries, highlights our commitment to promoting amicable dispute resolution worldwide. With a robust legal framework, top-tier professionals and a commitment to innovation, Singapore will continue to serve as a premier dispute resolution hub, offering certainty and fairness in an increasingly complex global business environment. Singapore has, over the years, succeeded in attracting inter-governmental dispute resolution institutions. The Permanent Court of Arbitration has an office here in Singapore. Singapore is also the first country to have a model agreement with the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea to host its proceedings. However, we cannot rest on our laurels. All around us, various jurisdictions have made significant developments and there is new competition for talent and disputes. Just this year, the new Abu Dhabi International Arbitration Centre (Arbitrate AD) was launched with new arbitration rules that emphasise transparency, efficiency and cost effectiveness. A significant change is that the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), is now the default seat of arbitration, unless otherwise agreed, shifting from the previous onshore Abu Dhabi framework. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, in his Chinese New Year dinner, mentioned Singapore has to: first, stay open in this tumultuous economic climate to attract the right talent and investments to Singapore; second, stay ahead of the competition and ahead of the curve; but at the same time, third, stay united as Singaporeans. Now, in this spirit, may I ask the hon Minister what more is the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) doing to maintain our competitive edge on this front? What is MinLaw doing to support the legal profession to better meet the demands of modern legal practice to strengthen Singapore as a leading legal and dispute resolution hub? [(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)] Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim: Chairman, access to justice must be real and meaningful for the common person, ensuring that legal protections work for those who need them the most. Singapore has taken concrete steps to make justice accessible, especially in key areas affecting everyday lives. For families and divorced mothers, enforcing maintenance orders is critical. In 2022, over 2,700 maintenance-related applications were filed. The Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP) now helps ensure that spouses and children receive the financial support that they are legally entitled to, reducing delays and hardship. In May 2023, the Family Justice Reform Bill was passed by Parliament and received Presidential assent. The Family Justice Reform Act seeks to, among others: firstly, make improvements to Court proceedings and procedure in the Family Justice Courts; and secondly, enhance MEP. What is the status of the changes to be implemented through this Act? With rising online harms, over 8,500 reported cases in 2023, swift protection is essential. The Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) provides Expedited Protection Orders against cyberbullying and harassment, ensuring that victims, including the vulnerable, can seek redress quickly. In this regard, the Prime Minister has announced that a new agency will be set up to deal with online harms and that the Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI) and MinLaw are working together on this piece of legislation. What measures does MinLaw have in mind for addressing online harms? For those in financial distress, the personal bankruptcy regime has been reformed. While over 1,600 bankruptcy orders were made in 2022, many benefited from the Debt Repayment Scheme, which offers a structured way to repay debts without the severe consequences of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy applications have increased in recent years as well. Does MinLaw consider that reforms to Singapore's bankruptcy law are necessary to address the evolving financial landscape? Sir, justice must be fair, accessible and effective for all, not just the privileged but the everyday person. Singapore remains committed to ensuring that legal protections truly serve those who need them the most. Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang): Chairman, it has been barely three decades since the Internet was first introduced into most of our lives. Many of us in this House may remember life and childhoods without the Internet. For the children of today, this is almost unthinkable. As Internet use has become a ubiquitous part of life, the potential for online harms has also grown. The issue of scams, many of which take place online, has just been discussed in the Ministry of Home Affairs' (MHA's) Committee of Supply (COS) debate. Other types of online harms include exposure to harmful online content or conduct, including explicit or violent materials, cyberbullying and harassment. Addiction to screens is also a problem, especially with children and youths; and countries, such as Australia, have passed legislation to limit access to social media for children. The Prime Minister announced in October last year that a new agency will be set up to deal with online harms and provide a one-stop centre for victims. He mentioned that MinLaw and MDDI are working together on this project. In conjunction with this, I also note that a public consultation was held by MinLaw and MDDI to get feedback from the public. Does MinLaw have any updates on this initiative, the likely legislative framework and details on the plans for this new agency? Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten): Sir, in July 2024, there was a report about an online influencer in Malaysia who took her life due to cyberbullying. In the same month last year, a survey done by MDDI found that 74% of Internet users face harmful content, like cyberbullying or sexual content online, but only a quarter report it. Many of us who are on social media have faced all sorts of cyberbullying at one point or another. Sometimes, the bully makes false allegations; sometimes, they deliberately use words intended to humiliate and hurt your feelings; the trolls frequently make insinuations about your character, they use mean and vicious words against you. Frequently, the bully hides behind the cloak of anonymity. This is not acceptable, especially for those younger social media users. Why should anyone using social media be subject to such bullying behaviour? Sir, in an answer to a Parliamentary Question in October 2024, Minister Josephine Teo said that the Government plans to introduce new legislation and measures to provide stronger support and assurance to victims of online harms, such as bullying. Can the Ministry provide an update as to the new legislation? Make it illegal for any social media user to use a false account to register that account. This means that if any user wishes to, say, bully others by making false allegations or using mean or harsh words, they must be held to account for the things they say. I look forward to the day when social media users can be protected from such bullying behaviour. Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio): Sir, in recent years, we have seen a rise in the seriousness and prevalence of online harms, such as cyberbullying and non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Singapore has developed a framework to address and mitigate these online harms through various legislation. The Ministry's plans to establish a dedicated agency, codify statutory torts and lift the veil of anonymity, will serve to enhance accountability and fortify our efforts in this regard. I would like to ask for an elaboration of the nature of timely assistance which will be provided to victims of online harms. Will the agency, for example, have the power to compel the removal of harmful content? How will the assistance be augmented to support vulnerable victims, for example, children as well as women? The agency will also be empowered to disclose the identity information of perpetrators to victims under specified circumstances. How will this be implemented in practice, given that many online platforms only require an email address for registration? What if the user of the account is overseas, for example? Finally, tackling online harms must be done upstream. How else can the agency work with community groups to educate the public on constructive and safe online behaviour? Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied): Sir, a person facing investigations or criminal charges may need to wait several months or even years before his case is concluded. I have seen how some lower-income Singaporeans struggle with this. A simple parking violation that usually attracts an out-of-Court composition fine is not paid, eventually leading to a Court hearing that requires a bailor. Failure to find a bailor will lead to pre-trial custody, which often leads to job loss or disruption of education, plunging the whole family into a much more precarious situation. I had previously raised this issue during the Justice System Motion in November 2020. To that end, I was very encouraged when the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) was amended last year to expressly require the law enforcement agency or judge to consider releasing a person charged with a less serious offence on his personal bond without the need for a bailor. Sir, the new provisions of section 93(1A) and section 93(1C) of the CPC, which came into force on 1 August 2024, after more than six months, it will be opportune to find out if there are significant outcomes to date. Are there indications from the law enforcement agencies that more eligible persons are being released on personal bond? Similarly, for those charged in Court, are there similar indications from the Courts that more accused persons are now being released on personal bond? The Chairman: Mr Patrick Tay. You can take your two cuts together. Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer): Sir, POHA has been around for a decade and the POHA Court set up. Can MinLaw provide an update on the number of cases filed and mediated by the POHA Court; and among all the POHA cases filed, what is the breakdown of the types, that is, how many involve community neighbours; how many are online harassment; how many are sexual harassment; and how many are workplace harassment? I also ask MinLaw how this Court has and can better ensure the efficient and effective resolution of harassment complaints. Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan: Sir, I have assisted and advised union members and workers in workplace disputes which may end up in the civil Courts or the Employment Claims Tribunal. The problem is that they may win the case and get a judgment either from the Courts or the Employment Claims Tribunal but their happiness and relief are often short-lived. This is because the employer may not be able or want to pay up. This would mean the aggrieved worker, often a layman, having to navigate and be subjected to the entire rigmarole to enforce the judgment and also incur monies to do so. In most instances, they would still need to engage a lawyer and may sometimes still be subject to a protracted enforcement process. There is thus a need to simplify, expedite and better the civil enforcement process and mechanism to facilitate the victim's recovery of monies. Can I ask MinLaw if it intends to review this and make enforcement more accessible, economical, expeditious and less painful for workers and the layman? Ms See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member): Last October, I asked if MinLaw would consider simplifying enforcement of small claims and employment claims tribunals' awards. I noted the Minister's reply that MinLaw was working on reforms, \"To make the enforcement of civil judgments more effective, efficient and simpler.\" The challenge of enforcing awards was also recently raised in the Straits Times forum. Could the Minister provide an update on reforms to address challenges of non-compliance with Court orders? Mr Vikram Nair: Chairman, the last few years have seen significant changes to improve access to justice. Thanks to initiatives from MinLaw, the Law Society, community organisations and, of course, the many lawyers that contribute their time and money to pro bono work. On the Ministry's part, it set up the Public Defender's Office, a major initiative that now provides criminal defence services for impecunious defendants. The Law Society has set up an Institution of Public Character called Pro Bono SG and through this, provided legal aid for those who need assistance in civil matters. In the Admiralty division, for example, the Realm of Tranquility, a local charitable organisation, collaborated with Pro Bono SG to open a community legal clinic at their premises which brings legal aid to the heartlands. These are commendable initiatives and I would like to know if the Ministry has any further plans to facilitate access to justice? An important aspect of justice is also the ability to enforce judgements easily. In the Committee of Supply 2024, the Ministry mentioned it was studying ways to improve the civil enforcement framework. I will be grateful for any updates on this. Finally, over the years, the Ministry has simplified the bankruptcy regime, making it easier for individuals to restructure debts and also made it easier for bankrupts to get discharged from bankruptcy. Perhaps, in part, because of these measures, the number of bankruptcy applications seems to have gone up. Does the Ministry have any views on this matter and is it planning any further actions in relation to the bankruptcy regime? The Chairman: Assoc Prof Razwana Begum, you can take your two cuts together. Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim (Nominated Member): Sir, access to justice is a fundamental pillar of a fair and equitable society, ensuring that individuals can protect their rights and seek redress through the legal system. Ensuring that legal services are accessible and affordable to all citizens, not only foster trust in the judicial system, but also supports the country's commitment to justice and equality for everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. In this context, how is the Ministry addressing the barriers faced by vulnerable populations in accessing justice and what strategies are in place to ensure their voices are both heard and protected? What initiatives are being introduced to make legal information and resources more available online? How is technology being leveraged to streamline legal processes, reducing the time and costs associated with accessing justice? Restorative justice and community mediation are effective at resolving conflicts and addressing harm within communities. Unlike traditional punitive systems, restorative justice focuses on healing and reconsolidation by involving all stakeholders in the process, including victims, offenders and the community. Mediation serves as a collaborative tool, facilitating open dialogue and mutual understanding to reach amicable resolutions. Together, these practices not only help reduce recidivism but also strengthen community bonds, promoting a more supportive and cohesive environment. In this context, what initiative is the Ministry implementing to promote community mediation and resolution and how is this addressing challenges, such as public awareness and acceptance, to encourage broader participation? In what ways is the Ministry ensuring that legal professionals receive adequate training in community mediation and restorative justice principles and what partnerships are being formed between the Ministry and community organisations to facilitate the successful implementation of mediation and restorative programmes? The Chairman: The next Member is not present. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir): Mr Chairman, I spoke on community disputes at last year's COS. As many of us in this House have experienced, managing and resolving disputes among neighbours, often living side by side, is one of the most challenging aspects of the work we do in the Community. Since then, I was heartened to see the passing of the Community Disputes Resolution (Amendment) Bill in November 2024. In particular, I was looking forward to observe how effective the new Community Relations Unit (CRU) will be, with officers given investigatory and enforcement powers to intervene in neighbourly disputes. Oftentimes, in disputes involving noise or other disagreements, it is a contest of one neighbour gathering \"evidence\" against the other. This can include recording each other's alleged noise or movements at odd hours or, in extreme cases, surreptitiously installing cameras directed at each other's homes. As one can expect, such behaviour is likely only to escalate and rapidly increase the temperature of the dispute, often damaging neighbourly relations beyond repair. Having an objective arbiter, like CRU, could reduce the need for extreme measures taken by the residents themselves, with decisions and outcomes acceptable to affected parties. Separately, the enhanced powers of the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) will also hopefully quicken the pace of resolving community disputes effectively. In this context, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to give an update on the implementation of the enhancements in the space of community mediation after the passing of the Community Disputes Resolution (Amendment) Bill. Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong): The online Community Justice and Tribunals System brings convenience to those who can go online. What happens to seniors who are less digitally-savvy, less literate or who may not be so familiar with the English language? What happens if these seniors want to access the Small Claims Tribunal or Protection from Harassment Court or other services under the CJTS? Does this mean the digitally disadvantaged may inevitably face an uneven playing field when it comes to accessing community justice with all these new digital platforms? Sir, digitalisation must not become a digital divide. Digital justice must not become difficult justice for the non-information technology (IT) savvy. We must avoid digital dropout where a case with merits is abandoned, because a senior found it too hard to access digital processes. The Chairman: Next Member is not present. Ms Sylvia Lim. Ms Sylvia Lim: Chairman, in Singapore, pursuing a creative career can be difficult due to the challenge of earning a stable living. However, it is vital that Singaporean artists, writers, filmmakers and other creatives can lead meaningful livelihoods and help support the growth of Singapore's artistic and cultural landscape. To that end, I have come across many creatives, such as film producers and photographers, who do not fully understand their rights, especially when it comes to the intellectual property (IP). Many are unaware that under the Copyright Act 2021, the IP rights in their creations automatically belong to them even if they were paid for that work. This is a crucial gap in knowledge that must be addressed. This becomes more urgent and important with the rise of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), which has led to the unauthorised use of copyrighted materials for profit-driven purposes. The recent open statement from Singapore's literary community to the National Library Board, signed by at least 88 local creatives, reflects growing concern over the lack of regard for copyrighted works and its potential impact on the vitality and viability of pursuing an artistic career. Besides promoting education and awareness, the Government can also consider introducing regulations on AI models to better level the playing field between AI developers and creatives. Some jurisdictions have started on this. For example, the European Union's (EU's) AI Act compels Gen AI models to demonstrate compliance with the EU's copyright law and provide a sufficiently detailed summary of the content used for training their models. Such obligations empower copyright-holders to exercise their rights by opting out of having their works used in text and data mining. In this regard, it would be good to understand whether there are ground outreach efforts to creatives to promote understanding of their IP rights. In addition, how are MinLaw and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) tackling the copyright challenges posed by AI. Ms See Jinli Jean: IPOS and the National Trades Union Congress' (NTUC's) Visual, Audio, Creative Content Professionals Association (Singapore) is partnering to raise IP awareness and proficiency among creators. Likewise, for companies that adopt AI, how will MinLaw guide them to adhere to ethical and respectful use of IP? For instance, copyrighted works should not be used to train Gen AI applications without permission or compensation. How will MinLaw balance between fostering innovation and protecting creators' IP? The Chairman: Mr Keith Chua, please take your two cuts together. Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, there are many avenues for our small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to grow both locally and internationally. There are also many helpful grants and different areas of financing support available. However, many of our SMEs may not be aware of the opportunity to unlock value of their intangible assets and IP rights. Successful businesses should ensure that they protect their brand value. This may also open up avenues for access to finance. How can IPOS support SMEs in this area? Has IPOS worked with trade associations and chambers (TACs) to better reach Singapore SMEs? Mr Chairman, Singapore has established herself as one of the leading places for international arbitration. Recent reports suggest that Singapore has become the leading arbitration hub. There are many accompanying benefits ranging from professional to economic. However, there is also keen competition from other cities. May I ask the Minister what steps are we taking and what steps can we be taking to deepen the attraction of Singapore as an arbitration hub? With the many global and technological changes more recently, including a more protective and uncertain world, how might this affect our efforts? Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan: Sir, I declare my interest as Director of Legal for NTUC and honorary member of the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association. In-house counsels in Singapore form a significant and growing part of our legal fraternity. The number of in-house counsels has outstripped the number of lawyers in practice to-date. This presents a great opportunity for our Singapore in-house legal counsels to differentiate themselves in their skills as well as how they help businesses move confidently in Singapore and around the globe, while also helping to bring back crucial work to our private practice lawyers and others in related fields. I therefore ask MinLaw to provide an update of their current support and longer-term plans to further uplift the career health and progression of in-house counsels in Singapore. In the legal fraternity and ecosystem, we have a group of para-legals, also known as paraprofessionals or legal executives in law firms and corporate entities. Many of them graduated from the law programmes offered by Temasek Polytechnic as well as other educational institutions. They also hope to build and boost their professionalism, competencies and standards, continuing education and career progression opportunities. I therefore ask how can MinLaw further help to uplift and enhance the career health and progression of para-legals and paraprofessionals. Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin: Chairman, I continue to speak up for law students and young lawyers in this Chamber. The demands of the legal industry on our juniors are not easy. To keep pace with the fast-evolving demands of the profession and to take care of our young lawyers while maintaining a strong pipeline, it is essential to ensure that our legal training frameworks remain robust and forward-looking. Under the new practice training framework, trainee lawyers must satisfy the dual seat requirement by rotating through a solicitor's seat and a litigation seat. For smaller firms operating as niche practices, arrangements must be made to rotate trainees to a covering law practice for them to gain exposure to a secondary seat. Does the Ministry have any indication as to the capacity of smaller firms to undertake the training of young lawyers and recruit future talent, given the necessity of rotating trainees out of their firm? Are measures being considered to support these firms in navigating such demands? With our growing role as a leading international arbitration hub, a rising number of disputes from our civil law neighbours may be heard on our shores. Is the Ministry considering furthering educational reforms to deepen and broaden civil law expertise among our law students and practitioners to ensure that we can remain at the forefront of international dispute resolution? Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member): Sir, I would like to seek an update from the Ministry on Singapore's position with regard to three international conventions, namely the Hague Convention of 2 July 2019 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters (Hague Judgments Convention), the Convention providing a Uniform Law on the Form of an International Will, (International Wills Convention) and the Hague Convention on the International Protection of Adults. Becoming a signatory to these conventions could strengthen Singapore's position as a global wealth management and family office hub. It could enhance legal certainty in cross-border disputes, simplify estate and succession planning for internationally connected families, and provide greater safeguards for vulnerable individuals who are based in Singapore but who have legal or financial interests across multiple jurisdictions. I would appreciate insights from the Ministry on any ongoing considerations, potential challenges or timelines for Singapore to join these conventions. Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin: Chairman, as our urban living grows increasingly dense, well-planned community areas are essential in creating dynamic and sustainable neighbourhoods. The Ministry has stated that it had identified opportunities to optimise state properties to better meet community needs and create greater social impact. What criteria is used to evaluate which state properties should be redeveloped? What are the specific community needs that are taken into consideration, given our diverse demographic? Does the Ministry have plans to pilot community concepts that engage a broader spectrum of Singaporeans so as to create dynamic spaces that foster meaningful interactions? Could the Ministry consider piloting co-living concepts in these properties, for example, or create more care and recreational spaces for Singaporeans? Mr Keith Chua: Mr Chairman, since launching the Singapore Land Authority's (SLAs') Reinventing Spaces into Vibrant Places (RSVP) programme, could the Minister kindly advise whether properties have been successfully awarded and, if so, how many? Singapore Land Authority's (SLAs') Reinventing Spaces into Vibrant Places Are any of the properties currently in use by the successful tenants? Are there any properties scheduled for launch in the coming year and, if so, when will be the timing of this launch? Will the decision for additional properties under this programme be solely determined by SLA and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)? In evaluating the interest generated in the programme thus far, can the Ministry advise whether the interest for state land is still leaning towards the more conventional method as there seems to be many more sites listed for tender under this method? Would there be favourable consideration by SLA for proposals from non-profit groups and organisations, given the increase in interest for arts, culture and heritage? Some community service organisations may find use of state properties as an option to better connect with the community. Is SLA open to such proposals? As an example, creative use of a property may enable it to be a welcoming touchpoint for persons to find out more about difficult topics, such as mental health or other conditions like anxiety or depression. Use of appropriate sites may also appeal to the seniors, especially if the property has an interesting history. It may be helpful for happy memories. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim: Chairman, state land assets are crucial to Singapore's urban planning and economic development. Singapore must maximise land use efficiency. How has SLA successfully optimised state assets to meet community and economic needs? How has the development of the Digital Conveyancing Portal been progressing since the last update at COS 2023? Is the project still expected to be completed by 2026? The Chairman: Minister Edwin Tong. The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai): Mr Chairman, this year, we celebrate SG60 and our nation-building efforts that have allowed Singapore to develop, prosper and thrive against the odds. Many factors have contributed to our transformation from Third World to First, and one of them is our commitment to building a strong legal system and advancing the rule of law. MinLaw will continue to uphold these fundamentals, to ensure the vibrancy of our economy, as well as to maintain trust and cohesion in our society. I thank the Members for their various suggestions through their cuts, and I will address Members' cuts in this speech, organised into two broad topics: first, strengthening Singapore's position as an international legal and IP hub to support our economic growth; second, improving legal processes and increasing access to justice to maintain trust and cohesion in our community. My colleague, Minister of State Murali Pillai, will speak about optimising the use of state assets and safeguarding our society from online harms. Sir, the Prime Minister has spoken about the challenges that Singapore is facing in this turbulent external environment. There are undoubtedly strong headwinds and we have to be cautious. But equally, in this environment, there are also opportunities if we remain attractive to foreign investments and maintain an open, thriving business environment. One reason Singapore has been able to attract foreign investments is the confidence in our legal system. My Ministry is committed to preserving and enhancing this trust in Singapore through three legal pillars which I will outline. First, continually strengthening our legal framework in which we operate. Our approach is to grow new areas to support emerging industries and evolving business models as well as to continue to build on our areas of strength. Let me briefly mention three areas. First, in the area of IP, which Mr Keith Chua spoke about. The value of an enterprise is increasingly in IP as well as in intangible assets (IA). But to realise this value, enterprises must be able to monetise both the IA and the IP. Only then will they be willing to invest in further innovation, which then further enhances and increases the value of their enterprise. Singapore's IP regime and innovation environment are recognised internationally. In 2024, Singapore climbed a spot to rank fourth globally in the World Intellectual Property Organisation's (WIPO's) Global Innovation Index and remained top in Asia. Under the Singapore IP Strategy 2030, or SIPS 2030, we are focused on spurring innovation and helping enterprises, including the smaller enterprises, unlock the value in their IA and IP. We support enterprises at various stages of their IP journey. For businesses with overseas expansion plans, IPOS will launch the IP Management Clinics Singapore programme, in collaboration with WIPO, in March 2025. This will provide enterprises with comprehensive IA and IP strategy support, including connecting with experts for a four-month mentorship. To Ms Sylvia Lim's query, for smaller enterprises and freelancers in the creative sectors, IPOS has simple info-packs as well as easy-to-understand videos that explain copyright and share best practices on using and protecting IP. In fact, Ms Lim, I remember that when I introduced the Bill that you spoke about, we had introduced as well the learner aids as well as these videos. In addition, IPOS also works with agencies like the National Arts Council (NAC) and the National Library Board (NLB), as well as industry partners, like Copyright Licensing and Administration Society of Singapore (CLASS) and the Visual, Audio, Creative Content Professionals Association (VICPA), to provide additional support. Just last year, in August 2024, IPOS signed a three-year MOU with VICPA, to support the creative industry in IP education and management, and capacity building. IPOS is also working on a video podcast with NAC and NLB to engage creatives in the music industry. This will be launched during World IP Day on 26 April later this year. IPOS also actively supports partner events, such as the International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations (IFRRO) World Congress to discuss copyright-related issues and developments. This will happen in October this year. In other words, going down to the basic industry, at that level, as well as elevating ourselves to world global thought leadership in these areas are all part of the efforts to enhance awareness and education in this space. And we will, indeed, look out for more opportunities to reach our creators to raise their awareness in this very quickly evolving environment. For enterprises looking to commercialise their IA and IP, IPOS is working with local and international partners to develop IA valuation guidelines that are interoperable internationally. We will seek public feedback on the draft IA valuation guidelines in the first half of 2025. Minister of State Murali Pillai will speak about the development of technology and its impact on IP rights. The second pillar I want to speak about is dispute resolution. From time to time, we all know businesses may run into disputes with others. It is really part and parcel of doing business. But they have to be resolved in an open, transparent manner, as well as efficiently. Over the years, we have updated our regime and enhanced our services. In short, we take a business-centric approach. We align our regime to international standards. We develop a full suite of options, whether it is in arbitration, mediation or litigation, or a combination of them, so that parties can choose, have the autonomy, depending on the nature of their needs as well as the particular circumstances of the transaction in question. We also give effect to party autonomy, be it choice of law or choice of forum, institution, modality of resolution, or the choice of counsel. Overall, Singapore has done well. If you take SICC, it is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. It has seen a steadily increasing caseload, including fresh filings. The caseload of SIAC, as well as SIMC, in both the arbitration and mediation spaces, have also seen a general upward trend. Many of these cases, in fact, have minimal connection to Singapore. To Mr Keith Chua's query, we will continue to strengthen our institutions. First, by embracing technology to provide value-added services to users. SIAC, as far as we know, is the only arbitration centre with ISO 27001 Certification for its Information Security Management system. SIMC has a Mediation AI Assistant, and Maxwell Chambers offers cutting-edge drone camera and holographic displays which aid in the presentation of evidence, as well as in the course of resolving disputes at hearings. Second, by providing platforms to profile Singapore as a thought leader in this space. Members will know that we have many international conferences in Singapore, such as the Singapore Convention Week that started since 2019 in the starting days of the Singapore Convention on Mediation which we have continued since. We have the Singapore-China International Commercial Dispute Resolution Conference. This takes place once a year – one year in China, and one year we hosted in Singapore. We will host it in Singapore later this year. These events, among others, not only provide a platform for leading experts to discuss latest developments, but they are also an opportunity for lawyers in Singapore to connect with the global community. Third, in debt restructuring and insolvency. This is an integral part of a well-functioning and well-developed economy. It provides practical and commercial options for companies as well as smaller businesses and entrepreneurs in financial distress, giving flexibility and realistic options to restructure. Successful restructurings not only allow the debtor to carry on as a going concern, but generally result in better outcomes for employees, creditors and investors. My Ministry has enhanced this framework over the last decade and let me speak about three parts of this framework. First, in corporate insolvency. We have grafted in features from leading, as well as tried-and-tested models, like, for example, chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, which we brought in about six to seven years ago. We have adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-border Insolvency; and we have also clarified the SICC's jurisdiction for cases with multi-jurisdiction elements, which are particularly a feature of large cross-border restructurings. We have introduced simplified insolvency, providing entities with simpler, faster and cheaper processes. Members will know we first introduced this as a temporary measure during COVID-19, and this was made permanent earlier this year to benefit more companies. Finally, in personal bankruptcy. We have a differentiated discharge framework for bankrupts. This is a rehabilitative regime that seeks to encourage financial prudence without, at the same time, stifling entrepreneurship. We have arrived at a regime, which we believe, balances the interests of debtors and creditors, maintaining a healthy lending environment for sustained economic growth whilst, at the same time, supporting debtors across the spectrum: from individual entrepreneurs to larger corporates, both locally as well as foreign. This has resulted in the growing use of Singapore's framework. For instance, the shipping firm, Pacific International Lines, and Vietnamese developer, No Va Land – a case heard in the SICC. To Mr Zhulkarnain's and Mr Vikram Nair's queries, we are not resting on our laurels. We are building on the experiences of these cases, as well as the experience of practitioners. We are carefully looking at the next set of refinements, considering feedback and we will look at introducing further enhancements. These enhancements that we are thinking about will include the following. First, the Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS) for individuals. MinLaw is looking to, among other matters, prevent misuse of the DRS by debtors who are advised by businesses to borrow irresponsibly and then self-petition for bankruptcy. Second, in the area of corporate rescue tools, in particular, in judicial management. We will also review our current Chapter 11 regime, to assess the need for changes. In 2023, some two years ago, we convened the Committee to Enhance Singapore's Corporate Restructuring and Insolvency (R&I) Regime. The Committee has been engaged in robust debates, consulted with stakeholders, discussed the recent cases that I mentioned, as well as taken consultations on its recommendations and it will be able to release a report shortly. Next, I move to the second pillar: expanding and growing our legal competency as well as capabilities. Sir, the world is increasingly complex and certainly, legal work is no longer limited by geographical boundaries. As Mr Zhulkarnain said, for our law firms and our legal professionals to compete effectively, they must keep up with emerging trends and offer unique advantages and we agree with that. To raise the quality and consistency of training, we implemented several changes in July 2024, pursuant to the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers. The syllabus for the course leading up to Part B of the Bar Examinations was expanded to cover a wider range of topics. The practice training period was lengthened to one year, to allow trainees more time to gain exposure to contrasting practice areas and develop a strong all-rounded foundation as they start their practice career. To Ms Nadia Samdin’s point, we recognise that small firms may occasionally need support to cope with these changes and we appreciate very much Ms Samdin's continual advocacy for young lawyers in this space. The Singapore Institute of Legal Education and the Law Society have released guides to help trainees and supervising solicitors navigate these changes. As Ms Samdin knows, it has been less than a year since we have commenced on this path, so we will take on board the experiences of young lawyers at smaller firms in the space but for the moment, the guidelines cover areas such as honorarium and leave. And the Law Society also published available training positions on their website, so that they become easier for trainees to find a training position in contrasting practice areas. The Law Society also offers career counselling, mentorship and guidance on practice training contracts. And the Law Society will implement other measures if necessary. Besides raising professional standards, we are also looking to shift mindsets and raise skillsets in our law firms and in our lawyers. One area in which we seek to do this is in that of technology. In the legal sector, AI can potentially perform tasks at the level of junior associates, but at a fraction of the time and cost. For example, a Thomson Reuters report estimated that AI can save professionals up to 12 hours per week by 2029. But instead of seeing this as a threat, let us also look at this as an opportunity for lawyers to go up the value chain, to focus on higher-value tasks looking at front-facing work, client-facing work. Globally, law firms in other jurisdictions, like the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK), leading jurisdictions, for example: they are embracing and harnessing legaltech in support of their work. To compete with them, our lawyers must also keep that open mindset and embrace legaltech. In 2022, we made available the Legal Technology Platform (LTP), a matter management and collaboration tool, to law firms that desired a ready product. Generative AI (Gen AI) was also added in 2024 as a feature through Copilot for SG law firms. We also made legaltech accessible to Singapore law practices, by providing subsidies to defray the cost. We understand that sometimes the startup costs or the cost of entry into such a product could be very high. And so, in 2022, for example, we offered the Productivity Solutions Grant for the Legal Sector (PSG-Legal) which provided 70% support for up to two years. From 1 April 2025, the support level will be 50% for one year – to align with other sectors. To date, there are over 70 successful PSG-Legal applications from Singapore law practices, for over 400 legaltech accounts. We will also be piloting a change management initiative in the second half of this year. We have heard some feedback from law firms that they require more support to improve their tech processes, whilst at the same time managing and juggling their existing priorities. We will therefore deploy legaltech consultants to the firms keen to join the pilot to diagnose their technology needs and recommend the appropriate tools for them in the context of their practice areas. Another area which I wish to speak about is civil law. Singapore is a common law jurisdiction, but many of our top trading partners come from civil law jurisdictions, such as China and Indonesia. These are large markets with immense opportunities. Therefore, to position our lawyers better, we will be deepening civil law content in law school curriculum. We will also continue to run the China Ready Programme as well as the Singapore-Shanghai Lawyers Exchange Programme, which help to provide lawyers with a deeper and more embedded understanding of China’s business and legal environment. And if there is demand for similar programmes in other markets and other jurisdictions, we will be happy to consider. Sir, it is important for our lawyers to continue to have a lifelong learning culture. Practice is evolving. The areas of practice are quickly moving and the thought leadership around the study of law and more importantly, the practice and application of law to the industry is quickly evolving. To encourage this, we refreshed the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) system and will be increasing the CPD requirements in phases. Lawyers can use and tap into the SkillsFuture funding for many of the courses. Besides lawyers, allied legal professionals and in-house counsel are also a vital part of our legal sector, as Mr Patrick Tay spoke about it a short while ago. The Singapore Academy of Law is working with the Law Society as well as the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association and Temasek Polytechnic on a Skills Framework for Legal Services and training roadmap. These will be first introduced for lawyers, followed by in-house counsel and then allied legal professionals over the next few years in phases. Temasek Polytechnic will also be introducing new courses in legal technology and legal project management for allied legal professionals. They have got feedback that these are areas that participants and students are keen on and so they will develop modules along these lines. Sir, moving to the third pillar – keeping ourselves open to the world. As a small city-state, we need to be plugged into the global economy. But to do so, we must enhance our networks and collaborate with others. This really is a win-win situation for us if we can manage it. We help partners meet their goals from Singapore and in doing so, bring work here into the Singapore jurisdiction, which might otherwise not be present in Singapore. Over the years, we have strengthened our legal cooperation with key and emerging markets. To give Members some examples, last year, we signed four Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) – two with Saudi Arabia, one with India and one with Kazakhstan – further expanding our global outreach into new markets. I have also made several trips in the course of last year to develop connections and help our law firms and lawyers build inroads into these markets. As Mr Zhulkarnain noted, we also increased our efforts to anchor in Singapore multilateral dispute resolution institutions, which administer disputes involving and including sovereign interests. This contributes to the international rule of law, as well as burnishes Singapore’s attractiveness as a premier dispute resolution hub. Let me give Mr Zhulkarnain some examples. First, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which is an intergovernmental organisation providing arbitration and other dispute resolution services, for states, is expanding its presence in Singapore, with our support. Singapore was its first physical office in Asia and since its establishment in 2018, over the last five years, the Singapore office has until 2023 administered over 135 cases from Singapore. Second, we have also signed an MOU with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and are working towards ICSID setting up its first physical office outside its headquarters in Washington DC here in Singapore. We also continue to welcome international law firms and foreign lawyers to anchor their presence here in Singapore. Singapore has gradually liberalised the legal sector since the 1990s and this has benefited Singapore and Singaporeans. Over the years, we have introduced various schemes, to allow foreign law firms to collaborate with our local law firms and the schemes are attenuated to fit the level of collaboration that the foreign lawyers want with the local counterparts. These schemes have been successful, but we will continue to review them – to refine the framework where necessary, and also how we can rationalise and streamline them, with one aim being to reduce the regulatory burden on the law firms complying with these schemes. The Committee to Review the Regulatory Framework for Law Practices and Collaborations in Singapore, which we set up in 2023, is expected to complete its work soon. I should add that we will not change our posture of being open. We remain open to foreign law firms and lawyers, while remaining committed to preserving the Singapore core in the legal profession. Mr Chairman, the sum of our work contributes to the economy by facilitating businesses and attracting investments, allowing Singapore to thrive. Overall, we have been successful in playing this role. In 2024, Singapore was first in the World Competitiveness Ranking and rated top for business efficiency. And in 2023, Singapore was ranked second by the World Bank for net inflows of foreign direct investments (FDIs), behind only the US. So, by and large, these measures that I have spoken about, they have been successful in uplifting the Singapore business environment. Mr Chairman, in the second part of my speech, I will focus on the domestic context. In recent times, many countries have seen their social fabric under stress and divisions forming, as parts of society feel left out and trust in institutions diminishes. In Singapore, we are fortunate that we remain united; but we cannot for once take this for granted. Our cohesive social fabric is underpinned by the rule of law and access to justice, and these are core pillars of our society. Therefore, we must continue to reinforce these fundamentals to maintain social trust and cohesion as well as uplift people’s lives. Our laws form the bedrock of society – how it is ordered; how it functions; and how its members behave and interact in this society. In our community, when individuals or businesses face friction with each other, they have a range of options to resolve their disputes and differences. This involves going before an impartial adjudicator or working with a trusted mediator and through this process, parties present their perspectives and find resolution in their conflict. A key part of this process is enforcement that some Members spoke about – that \"last mile\", where parties realise their rights, obtain redress and then move on. This has been a matter of focus for my Ministry. When a party receives a judgment, this must be enforced effectively. Otherwise, it is only really a paper judgment. We have therefore been working to strengthen enforcement in two key areas: first in family justice; and second in civil judgments. Let me give Members an update on these two areas. Sir, families form the building blocks of our community. Where relations break down, we want to help to reduce the acrimony and allow parties to heal and to move on. A key improvement was the creation of the Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP), as highlighted by Mr Zhulkarnain. Unfortunately, the reality is that there remains a fairly high incidence of non-compliance with maintenance orders. There is also a significant number of repeat applications for enforcement. Therefore, under the MEP, Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs) are empowered to obtain information about the parties’ financial circumstances and these findings will help the Courts make more effective maintenance enforcement orders. They can also facilitate settlements between the parties, which encourages more sustainable outcomes and judgments. The MEP was operationalised in January. A new unit of MEOs in MinLaw have started taking cases. They will progressively expand their operations in phases. To Mr Patrick Tay and Ms Jean See’s queries, MinLaw will also introduce reforms to make the enforcement of civil judgments more effective, simple and streamlined. We received feedback that the time, effort and costs – Mr Tay spoke about that – of enforcing judgments can sometimes be disproportionate to the judgment sum. We are looking to address these areas by providing the Court with greater powers to identify the assets and income streams of the judgment debtor as well as introducing new modes of enforcement to deter and punish non-compliance with Court orders. We will also create new Civil Judgment Enforcement Officers, who will effectively assist litigants who wish to enforce their civil judgments. These reforms will be made available to our civil courts, which includes tribunals such as: the Employment Claims Tribunal, which Mr Tay spoke about; the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals; as well as the Small Claims Tribunal. Sir, as Members will know, these proposed changes are novel. They depart from the existing framework for enforcement. We are currently studying them, evaluating them and consulting with interested parties, including Members of the Bar and the Judiciary. More details will be released in due course as we complete this study. Sir, we continually work to improve access to justice, particularly for the most vulnerable. This ensures they receive help and no one is left behind. To Mr Vikram Nair and Assoc Prof Razwana's queries, MinLaw has had a long history, being at the forefront of providing aid and assistance in the civil and criminal spheres including through programmes, such as the Legal Aid Bureau (LAB), for instance; and more recently, the Public Defender's Office (PDO). Since 1958, LAB has provided the vulnerable with civil legal aid, including in matrimonial, monetary claims as well as probate matters. Beyond taking on legal cases, LAB has strengthened connections in the community, for example, by organising networking sessions between family lawyers and social service professionals. MinLaw has been supporting the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) as well, which is administered by Pro Bono SG, and progressed to directly fund them since 2015. And from December 2022, PDO was operationalised to facilitate access to justice for more accused persons. Sir, PDO has grown over the years. Today, it has a team of 22 public defenders. In 2024, PDO received almost 1,900 applications and about 1,000 were assessed as eligible. A part of these eligible applications is referred to CLAS, and between CLAS and PDO, they serve the section of the community who are most vulnerable. This partnership exemplifies the pro bono spirit among the legal fraternity – a partnership between the Government as well as Pro Bono SG, which is really ground-up, supported by many lawyers in the private sector. This helps us to ensure that legal aid remains accessible not just across the criminal spectrum, which CLAS and PDO looks after, but also across the civil sector. Last year, we updated the quantum of the per capita household income (PCHI) as well as the Annual Value (AV) for eligibility criteria to ensure that, in the light of increase in household income and property value in recent years, we will continue to serve the target audience and target persons who need assistance. We continually review these thresholds to ensure that they are kept in line. Sir, before I conclude, let me quickly touch on community disputes – a topic that Mr Sitoh Yih Pin raised and which I also spoke extensively a few months ago when I introduced the Bill. To Mr Sitoh Yih Pin's queries, the enhancements will be implemented shortly. The Community Relations Unit (CRU) pilot, including directed mediation, for severe noise and hoarding cases will start in Tampines from the second quarter of this year. Following the pilot, we will consider how to sustainably scale-up the process island-wide. On mediation, as touched on by Assoc Prof Razwana, the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) continues to promote the benefits of mediation through channels like social media as well as everyday advertisements, such as those we see at the bus stops, for instance, to reach out to those who might need awareness brought to them about these schemes. To manage the anticipated increase in caseload, around 30 duty mediators have been identified to manage directed mediation cases. CMC has also increased the number of satellite mediation locations from 10 in 2023 to 18 in 2025. This will allow more convenience as well as improve accessibility. Sir, let me just say a few words in closing. I have spoken about our approach in growing the economy and maintaining trust and cohesion in society. These are two very important outcomes of the work that we do at MinLaw. Singapore's success is underpinned by our strong legal system, based on the rule of law. That is something that is really non-negotiable for us in all the work that we do at MinLaw. On this note, I would like to inform Members that we will be commemorating next year, the 200th anniversary of the establishment of Singapore's modern legal system via the Second Charter of Justice. It was in 1826 – next year will be 200 years. A series of events will take place to commemorate the occasion. More details will be announced in due course. And I hope that Members will come and support these programmes and events next year. The Chairman: Minister of State Murali Pillai. The Minister of State for Law (Mr Murali Pillai): Sir, I would like to start off by adding my appreciation to hon Members for their cuts as well as their speeches in this debate. I would cover three broad areas: first, the prudent and imaginative use of state assets; second, safeguarding our society from concerns posed by emerging technologies; and third, access to justice. The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) ensures effective and imaginative use of land resources. To address Mr Zhulkarnain and Ms Nadia Samdin's queries, this is done by cultivating a good understanding of social and community needs through proactive engagement. For example, SLA engages the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre and community entities, such as New Hope, to understand their challenges in finding suitable spaces. Through such engagements, SLA identified emerging demands, such as silver co-living and the need for community spaces. First, to address rising demand for independent living for older Singaporeans, SLA activated state properties, such as 79 to 95 Hindoo Road, 26 Evans Road and 98 Henderson Road. Building on the response, SLA plans to launch a tender in the first quarter of this year for 20 heritage properties at Admiralty Road East for multi-generational co-living. Proposals with holistic programming and emphasis on inter-generational co-living that encourages independent senior living will be favourably considered. Second, SLA is activating state properties with potential to bring communities together. One example is the transformation of 30 Maxwell Road into a wellness and fitness hub through the joint initiative with URA, Reinventing Spaces into Vibrant Places, as noted by Mr Keith Chua. Another example is the transformation of the former Elections Department office at 11 Prinsep Street into a social impact hub named The Foundry, which started operations last year. Further, SLA will restore and repurpose Block 1 East Coast Road (1ECR) for community and social uses. The renovated space will provide programmes and training to support youths as well as recreational activities for all ages. SLA called a tender for a multidisciplinary team of consultants in September 2024 to provide consultancy services for Additions and Alteration works, with estimated completion in 2028. SLA will continue collaborating with agencies to introduce more state properties for economic and social uses. By launching more Price-Quality tenders, SLA will be able to better curate placemaking efforts to benefit the community. Besides optimising the use of state assets, we are harnessing technology to digitalise transactions. Singapore's current conveyancing system is reliant on physical documents and processes, and requires significant manpower. SLA has therefore been developing the Digital Conveyancing Portal (DCP). It is a fully integrated digital end-to-end conveyancing process for all types of property, from the stage of Option to Purchase (OTP) to legal completion. It will also enable e-payments and digital documents. When operationalised, the DCP will provide greater convenience to all parties, including buyers and sellers, law firms, real estate professionals, financial institutions and developers. We are testing the system rigorously and seeking industry feedback, including on how the phases of the DCP should be prioritised and the continuing evolution of associated technology. The first phase of the DCP focuses on private residential resale transactions, which make up more than half of private real estate transactions. Beta testing of the OTP process started in November 2024 with selected stakeholders. Live OTP transactions for the private residential resale market is targeted to commence as a pilot initially in 2025. The DCP functions and types of transactions will be progressively expanded in subsequent phases. Even as technology becomes integral, we are aware that it also presents issues, particularly with copyright. Our IP regime incentivises the creation of new works by rewarding creators with a set of rights over the use of their works, at the same time, allows reasonable access to these works by third parties, including other creators and innovators, who may build on them. In this way, we maximise creative and innovative output through a balanced approach. Ms Sylvia Lim and Ms Jean See asked about the balance in the context of AI. While the IP regime enables the use of copyright materials for digital innovation, we have built in conditions to protect legitimate interests of rights-holders. In particular, if copyright materials are used to train AI models, the materials must be lawfully accessed. For example, for materials behind pay walls, through paid access. Furthermore, rights-holders can use the copyright protection regime to take action against the generation or use of content substantially similar to their own. We recognise technologies, such as Gen AI, significantly impact many stakeholders. The Government remains committed to working with the creative community to address their concerns. There is ongoing engagement with stakeholders, including those in the creative sector, such as writers, publishers, record labels and creative agencies. Some of the suggestions received include greater transparency in how copyright material is used for AI training and for rights-holders to have more control over use of their material. We are studying these suggestions. For example, we are exploring with MDDI and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), support for transparency measures and respect for copyright in our AI governance policies and tools, such as IMDA's upcoming safety guidelines for Gen AI model developers and app deployers. MinLaw and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) will continue to work with stakeholders to maintain the right balance that will support creativity and innovation. We also focus on the impact of technology in the legal sector. Legal professionals should use Gen AI tools safely and responsibly, even as we encourage its adoption. The need for guardrails is clear because: one, Gen AI may give inaccurate responses or hallucinate; two, security and privacy concerns – some Gen AI models may store user information and search history to train the model and this may then be reproduced for responses to other users; and three, ethical concerns with the rapid development of Gen AI by different programmers, it is critical that Gen AI tools are developed within a framework guided by principles, ethics and rules. Considering this context, MinLaw is working on guidelines to guide legal professionals to be smart buyers and users of Gen AI tools. We have consulted stakeholders, such as the Singapore Courts, Law Society and IMDA, and will consult the industry in due course. Another facet of digitalisation is the emerging threats to users and our community. Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Zhulkarnain and Ms Nadia Samdin asked about the Government's efforts to combat online harms. The Government has taken significant steps to address the prevalence of online harms. This includes, among others, enacting the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) in 2014 and strengthening it in 2019, to provide victims with legal recourse for harassment, including online harassment; and enacting the Online Safety, Miscellaneous (Amendments) Act and the Online Criminal Harms Act to allow the Government to act against harmful content. However, online harms continue to be an area of concern for many – and hon Members said that in their speeches too. A 2024 survey by MDDI found that two-thirds of respondents encountered harmful content on social media. Online harms are an especially serious problem for the young and young women in particular. In a 2023 study by SG Her Empowerment (SHE), more than half of the respondents between 15 and 24 years old reported having personally experienced online abuse. This was more than in any other age group. Within this age group, young women were nearly twice as likely as men to be victims of sexual harassment. And 40% of victims of online harassment reported suffering severe emotional and psychological distress, including depression and self-harm. MinLaw and MDDI have been studying the gaps that remain. We have consulted extensively with community groups, such as those working with youths, and women and girls; experts; technology companies; and the Judiciary. The key gaps identified are the need for a simple and fast process to seek relief from online harms. The Court process can be daunting and difficult to navigate. Uncertainty over whether existing laws can be used to address new emerging harms and the lack of accountability as perpetrators are often anonymous. To address these gaps, MinLaw and MDDI are working together on new legislation that will cover three broad buckets. First, it will establish a new agency that will act quickly on complaints of online harms. MDDI will share more details about the agency as well as some of its broader efforts to deal with online harms. Second, it will set out Statutory Torts to clarify the types of online harms covered under the law, and the rights and duties of the various parties in the online ecosystem. These Statutory Torts will provide a clear legal basis for victims to hold to account those responsible for the harm they suffer. We intend for the Statutory Torts to apply to a range of serious online harms, including online harassment, intimate image abuse and child abuse material. Third, it will introduce new mechanisms to address the misuse of anonymity by perpetrators of online harms. As Ms Nadia Samdin and others have rightly observed – there must be adequate information in the first place, if the intent is to enhance accountability. Victims may apply to find out a perpetrator's user information. The victim may need to know, so as to consider legal proceedings, better protect himself or herself from the perpetrator. The provision of such information will be subject to safeguards, to prevent abuse. The information should not be used to carry out \"counter-attacks\". Stakeholders, such as the tech companies, have also expressed some reservations – mainly about how such measures will impact their business. We will work closely with them to mitigate their concerns. We will announce more details in due course. The Government is committed to ensuring that victims have accessible and effective remedies when they suffer online harms. Mr Patrick Tay asked for figures relating to the Protection from Harassment Court (PHC). The number of applications for protection orders to the PHC since it started operations on 1 June 2021 are as follows: (a) 346 PO applications were filed in 2021; (b) 520 in 2022, (c) 526 in 2023; and (d) 631 in 2024. In terms of breakdown, out of the 2,023 PO applications filed from 1 June 2021, which is when the PHC commenced operations, to 31 December 2024, there were complaints about the following kinds of harassments: (a) 760 cases involved cyberbullying; (b) 719 cases involved doxing; (c) 485 cases involved workplace harassment; (d) 253 cases involved sexual harassment; and (e) 122 cases involved harassment by debt collectors, moneylenders or creditors. The total number is 2,339, though there were 2,023 applications, because a single application can contain complaints for about more than one type of harassment. I now turn to Ms Sylvia Lim's query on the personal bond in criminal cases – an amendment in the Criminal Procedure (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2024. This allows persons accused of non-bailable offences punishable with up to seven years' imprisonment to be released on personal bond, as an alternative to bail. Previously, persons accused of such offences could only be released on bail while awaiting investigations or trial. They will be remanded if they are unable to find a bailor, even if they are offered bail. With this amendment, they may be released by putting up a bond by themselves in appropriate cases. This reduces the disruptions to their lives and earning capacity, as mentioned by the hon Member. Since the amendment was implemented in August 2024, more than 100 accused persons have been released on personal bond for non-bailable offences. The personal bond regime is new and in its infancy. We will continue to keep our policies on remand and bail under review. Lastly, I turn to our work on ensuring access to justice. Second Minister Edwin mentioned about the good work of the Public Defender's Office and the Legal Aid Bureau. MinLaw is also working with various partners to increase access to justice, including through technology. Notably, we have collaborated with Pro Bono SG to develop LawGoWhere. Launched in March last year, this is a first-stop portal that consolidates access to legal information, legal services and law awareness resources. This year, a legal help finder will be integrated, to make it easier for users to seek legal information. Users may key in information such as their postal code and legal issue, and receive legal assistance options, such as their nearest legal clinics. Even as the use of technology increases, we are mindful of the digital divide, a point that Dr Tan Wu Meng made. On his query, measures have been taken to ensure that justice remains accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of familiarity with technology. For example, individuals who have difficulties with Court e-services, like the Community Justice and Tribunals System, can contact the State Courts by calling their hotline. They may also visit the State Courts Business Centre to access digital terminals or approach the State Courts Service Hub if they require assistance. Before I conclude, Mr Chairman, I would like to thank hon Members for their comments. Ms Usha Chandradas spoke about possible areas for law reform. Given the full slate of work outlined, some of these reviews will require more time for careful consideration. I understand from the Ministry of Social and Family Development that the same also applies to the 2000 Protection of Adults Convention. Prof Razwana also spoke about recidivism. This was covered by the Ministry of Home Affairs in their COS. Mr Chairman, Sir, in conclusion, Second Minister Edwin Tong spoke about the importance of the law and legal processes on achieving good outcomes for Singapore, underpinned by the rule of law. He also spoke about our efforts and approach to growing the economy, even as Singapore faces challenges in this turbulent external environment. We will strengthen our legal framework to be business-friendly and forward-looking, especially in the areas of IP, dispute resolution and debt restructuring and insolvency. Furthermore, Second Minister Tong outlined our moves to grow the capabilities of law firms and legal professionals – through adoption of LegalTech, facilitating access to overseas markets and uplifting all areas of the profession to grow new competencies. Then, he spoke on Enforcement Mechanisms in Family Justice and Civil Enforcement; as well as helping the most vulnerable in our society access the legal system. He also provided an update on the Community Disputes Management Framework. Lastly, he announced our celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of Singapore's modern legal system. I have covered SLA's efforts to optimise the use of state assets to meet changing needs and developments on the Digital Conveyancing Portal; our efforts to maintain a robust and balanced IP regime that supports creativity and innovation, as well as ensuring that the legal profession uses Gen AI safely and responsibly; new legislation to enhance protection for the vulnerable online; updates on the Protection from Harassment Court; implementation of reforms on personal bond; and leveraging technology for access to justice while preventing a digital divide. Together, these form the foundations of our shared public life. Laws are made together, and made legitimate, in this House, but it is only in the living and the working out of these rules, that we as a country, give them life. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim: Thank you, Chairman. I have two sets of questions: one for Minister Edwin Tong, the other for Minister of State Murali Pillai. For Minister, on the debt repayment scheme. I truly welcome MinLaw's approach whereby they are looking to refining the debt repayment scheme, which is currently susceptible to abuse. I know of debtors who engage third-party consulting firms and they are charged exorbitantly for such services. And indeed, the debtors themselves are being asked to take up further loans to pay for such services. So, may I ask the Minister on the regulatory standpoint, how does MinLaw plan to enhance oversight of third-party debt consultancy firms to prevent misinformation and exploitation of debtors. And on the public front, whether the Ministry can consider collaborating with other Ministries or social service agencies to provide debtors with the accurate or reliable financial guidance and protect them from being exploited by such firms. I think public awareness is key. For Minister of State Murali, on the digital office on the safety and online harms, the potential collaboration with MDDI. We note the challenges such that digital office may face to keep up with new technologies, high volume of harmful content and the misuse of anonymity. My question is a technical one. It is on jurisdiction for Statutory Torts. I understand that the Statutory Torts will be a whole suite that will be introduced by MinLaw, but would they also be pursuant to the double actionability rule for conflict of laws? For instance, does the Tort need to be actionable in Singapore and the country where that Tort occurred – the lex loci delicti and lex fori issues. Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: Sir, I thank Mr Zhulkarnain for his support for the proposed scheme. And indeed, it is true. The irony is that some debtors consult with these firms only to find that they end up in a bigger hole, a larger debt, as a consequence of trying to find a solution to their debt. So, we are very mindful of this and we will take steps to look at how we can have levers to clamp down on such practices by these firms. Indeed, it is also true, Sir, as Mr Zhulkarnain points out, that public awareness is key, to paraphrase him. We will step up significantly on steps to raise awareness and we will do this in a few ways. First, we will put information on MinLaw's website. We will enhance it, to make it informative and user friendly. Second, we intend to also publish a guide to help debtors along the journey of submitting bankruptcy applications, and teach them and guide them on what steps to take, to try to turn them away from having to rely on such debt consultancy firms to get assistance for the paperwork. So, we will simplify as much as we can, as well as publish step-by-step guidelines, so that they can avoid going to these firms. Finally, we will also look at measures to proactively reach out to debtors, for example, imposing mandatory credit counselling as a prerequisite for filing bankruptcy application, so that we get to them first, try and educate them, raise awareness on the process, so that we can deter them as much as we can from turning to the debt consultancy firms. Mr Murali Pillai: Sir, with respect to the hon Member, Mr Zhulkarnain's question on jurisdiction, as was mentioned in my speech, this creation of Statutory Torts is really providing civil causes of action for victims. And the jurisdiction is based on the civil jurisdiction of the Courts as it stands now, it is quite expansive. And in situations where the double actionability rule, which deals with the commission of Torts overseas, and whether or not there is a basis to pursue it here, whether it applies depends on the current rules. The Chairman: Ms Sylvia Lim. Ms Sylvia Lim: Thank you, Chair. I have two clarifications for Minister of State Murali on the Criminal Procedure Code amendments on pre-trial release. Earlier, he mentioned that under the new provisions that were effective on 1 August, about 100 persons had been released on personal bond instead of on bail. I would like him to confirm that this is actually the combined number from law enforcement, as well as the Courts. That is the first question. And the second question is if that is the case, this means that if it is 100 persons over six months, it is only about 16 persons per month, which to me is quite a low figure. And to this end, can he confirm that there are ongoing efforts to train, especially our law enforcement agencies, on the use of this new provision? Mr Murali Pillai: Sir, with respect to the hon Member Ms Lim's question, my understanding is this is in relation to Court cases, but I can double check and perhaps, clarify this separately. [Please refer to \"Clarification by the Minister of State for Law\", Official Report, 4 March 2025, Vol 95, Issue 157, Clarification section.] The Chairman: Any other clarifications? Ms Lim. Ms Sylvia Lim: Thank you, Sir. So, just to follow up, I would just like to know whether there are ongoing efforts to train our officers involved on the new provision and how to apply it in applicable cases. Mr Murali Pillai: Sir, that would be something that is within the province of the MHA. Certainly, we can convey the feedback as well. The Chairman: Any other clarifications from Members? If not, could I invite Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim to withdraw your amendment. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim: Sir, I thank Minister Edwin Tong and Minister of State Murali Pillai for their clear clarifications and plans for MinLaw and for our fellow Singaporeans. Sir, the law is the tool, but justice is the ideal. I thank the staff and officers of MinLaw for making access to justice the ideal for our Singaporeans. With that, I seek leave to withdraw my amendment. [(proc text) The sum of $356,441,800 for Head R ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates. (proc text)] [(proc text) The sum of $138,973,500 for Head R ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates. (proc text)] Clarification by the Minister of State for Home Affairs The Chairman: Before I move on, Minister of State Sun, you have a clarification to make? The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling): Mr Chairman, I would like to clarify a statement I had made in response to the supplementary question raised by Mr Vikram Nair earlier at the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Committee of Supply (COS) proceedings. The Chairman: Go ahead. Ms Sun Xueling: I had said there was a decrease in scam losses on Carousell by about 10% and on Facebook Marketplace by about 60%. I would like to clarify that I had meant that over the course of six months in 2024, the number of e-commerce scams decreased by about 10% on Carousell and by about 60% on Facebook Marketplace. I had actually mentioned the same figures in my COS speech but subsequently, in my response to Mr Vikram Nair, I think I had not been clear enough and I had misspoken. So, I would like to put this on record. The Chairman: Alright. Let us move on. Committee of Supply – Head L (Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment) Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Mr Chairman, I move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". It has been a privilege chairing the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Sustainability and the Environment who have pushed hard for positive changes, a privilege to have seen first-hand the good work done by our dedicated teams at the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), National Environment Authority (NEA), Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and Public Utilities Board (PUB). MSE does vital work in safeguarding the food we eat, the water we drink, the environment in which we live, work and play in, our climate and the survival of this planet we call home. I know it is rare for me to stand up here for almost a minute already and not ask questions, call for changes and nag for things to be done. But truly and sincerely, we have seen much progress made in MSE's policies and legislation and I am truly grateful. Many activists are thankful that many of their voices have been heard and our policies, especially on the climate change front, have improved significantly over the years. With the recent passing of the 574 pages Food Safety and Security Bill, we have also improved food security in Singapore and ensured a safer supply of fresh water and food. With the passing of the Good Samaritan Food Donation Bill, we have ensured that we have done more to tackle food waste. In this Committee of Supply (COS), I look forward to hearing more about the progress from the hard work of our teams again at MSE, NEA, SFA and PUB. Thank you again, for your dedication, passion and determination. I almost ended this speech without asking for anything, but you know, that is impossible. I am sure Senior Minister of State Amy Khor and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng expect me to talk about second-hand smoke and I shall not disappoint them. We have done so well in so many areas except in the area of second-hand smoke. Fresh air is as vital as fresh food, fresh water and a healthy planet. I truly and sincerely hope that MSE can put our hearts and minds towards tackling the issue of second-hand smoke. People depend on us to protect them from second-hand smoke. I hope that in 2025, we will finally change our policies and legislation to protect people from second-hand smoke in their own homes. I know my GPC colleagues and fellow Members of Parliament will be asking lots more questions about the Ministry's other plans for 2025. I look forward to a robust debate. Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim (Nominated Member): Addressing climate change will assist and ensure Singapore's long-term resilience and sustainability. As a densely-populated island nation with limited resources, strategic urban planning and promoting sustainable practices and core components of an effective climate change strategy is critical. In this context, how does the Ministry plan to work with business and industry to align their practices with climate resilience goals, and what support is available to help them transition? What strategies are the Ministry implementing to enhance the city's resilience to climate change and how are these strategies being integrated into urban planning and development? How is the Ministry engaging with communities to foster a culture of sustainability and encourage individual actions that contribute to a climate-resilient future? And finally, how is the Ministry collaborating with international partners and organisations to share best practices and innovations in building sustainable and climate-resilient cities? Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang): Mr Chairman, Singapore, as a small and open economy, faces dual pressures, staying competitive amid global decarbonisation efforts while mitigating the adverse impact of climate change. This is not just an economic issue but also a national resilience challenge. Countries worldwide are tightening carbon regulations and implementing green tariffs. Businesses that fail to adapt risk being left behind. To remain competitive, Singapore must lead in green innovation and establish itself as a hub for low-carbon technologies. I urge the Government to accelerate investments in green industries. The Singapore Green Plan has set a strong foundation, but we need to scale-up investments in emerging fields, like hydrogen energy, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture technologies. I also urge the Government to strengthen our workforce capabilities. We must expand SkillsFuture funding for green skills, ensuring our workforce is future-ready. This includes training in sustainability reporting, carbon trading and climate risk assessment. Next, I also urge the Government to enhance our carbon pricing strategy. While Singapore's carbon tax is set to rise, we should explore differentiated pricing to incentivise cleaner energy adoption while ensuring businesses remain competitive. Singapore's businesses, especially the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), need support to transition without compromising economic growth. I recommend a Green Transition Fund for SMEs. Smaller businesses often struggle with upfront costs for sustainable transformation. A targeted fund could provide upfront co-funding for energy-efficient technologies and green certification. Stronger regional collaboration. We can work with Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) partners to develop cross-border carbon credit markets and supply chains for green materials. This positions Singapore as the go-to hub for sustainable trade. Next, also to expand expanding the Enterprise Sustainability Programme (ESG). I urge that more direct assistance should be provided for the SMEs adopting ESG practices, including tax incentives for sustainability investments. Climate change is not just an economic challenge. It impacts our daily lives. Rising sea levels, extreme weather and food security concerns demand long-term resilience planning. Enhancing climate adaptation infrastructure. Projects like the \"Long Island\" plan and coastal protection measures must be accelerated, with greater private sector participation. Securing food and energy resilience. We must continue expanding local food production and invest in alternative energy sources, like regional renewable imports and nuclear research. Next is to strengthen social resilience. A just transition must ensure that lower-income households are not disproportionately affected by climate policies. Utility rebates and green job opportunities should be integrated into our support measures. As an island surrounded by seawater, all coasts are at risk of the rising sea level. Would the Ministry provide an update on the site-specific studies of our coasts? Most Singaporeans would have heard about the East Coast Plan. What about the other coasts? We have about 64 islands, of which, seven belong to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Measures must be taken to protect their shores as well, as there are implications for our defence planning. What are the mitigating measures planned for the islands for civilian use, such as Sentosa; and industrial use, such as Jurong Island? Our drainage infrastructure has been continuously upgraded to reduce flood-prone areas. Which areas are expected to benefit from recent works and what are the target dates for their completion? Would MSE share how it is working with building owners and transport operators to prepare for potential floods in high-risk areas? How will MSE engage drivers to bring them onboard flood warning systems? Prevention is better than cure. To improve thermal comfort, our buildings should be built to mitigate the heat effect of our tropical climate. Glass facades are not suitable for tropical buildings because they absorb excessive solar radiation, leading to overheating indoors. As a result, occupants rely on heavy usage of air conditioning, which consumes a lot of energy and contributes even more to global warming. I suggest that we consider introducing building regulations to reduce the number of glass facades for new buildings. What new measures will MSE be implementing to improve thermal comfort in public spaces, including hawker centres and community centres? When temperatures spike, what are the warning signs and warning systems as well as advisories that will be in place to keep the public safe, especially workers, the elderly, students, uniform personnel and residents doing sports? Lastly, Singapore is at a crossroads. We must act decisively to balance economic competitiveness with climate resilience. By investing in green industries, supporting businesses and fortifying our society, we can position Singapore as a global leader in sustainable development. I look forward to MSE's response on how we can sharpen our strategies in these critical areas. Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang): Chairman, the road to building a strong commitment to climate change is a long and winding one, with crisscrossing headwinds along the way as some governments wane in the face of challenges, like rising interest rates, economic hiccups, from inflation to business downturn, to name a few. And you have the new political leadership in the White House, which, again, withdrew its membership from the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015. Some see climate action as something about declaring dates to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, but there are just too many barriers to overcome. We have seen developing countries being asked to \"leapfrog\" to renewable energy, but the adoption of renewable energy is not something that can be done with the switch of a button. It requires a lot of investment and certainly, a strong will to change to clean energy. Besides, many are so used to fossil fuel that they become addicted. In Singapore, according to a report by EcoBusiness, one of Asia Pacific's independent media and business intelligence organisation dedicated to sustainable development, \"few firms can confidently say they know how they will be completely negating their greenhouse gas output by 2050 – a feat scientist regard as the best bet to keep global temperatures from rising past 1.5 degrees Celsius and causing extreme climate risks. Experts say it is necessary for firms to stomach such uncertainty and gun for net-zero targets, given the urgency of tackling climate change, though there must be preparation work in resourcing and talent development.\" May I ask, how can Singapore stay competitive amid global pressures to decarbonise, while also managing the adverse impact of climate change? How will the Government support our businesses in these areas? Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang): Chairman, in warm and sunny Singapore, air conditioning is widely used in homes, offices and shops. Air conditioning alone accounts for about 24% of an average household's electricity consumption. Together, buildings and homes are the second-largest contributor of carbon emissions in Singapore at 19%, of which a significant portion is from air conditioning. The problem is that our widespread use of air conditioning is actually pushing up external temperatures and contributing to global warming. Air conditioners exacerbate the urban heat island effect; use hydrofluorocarbons, which are potent greenhouse gases, as refrigerants; and consume high amounts of electricity generated from fossil fuels. Sustainability is everyone's responsibility. What is the Ministry doing to change the attitudes and behaviours of Singaporeans towards sustainability, so as to reduce the use of air-conditioning in indoor spaces? The Chairman: Mr Gan Thiam Poh, you may take your two cuts together. Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Thank you, Chairman. Singapore's carbon tax has been increased to $25 per tonne. It will rise to $45 per tonne in 2026 and 2027. This will have an impact on electricity bills. With expected higher electricity bills, businesses will be hard hit. However, it is not easy for many companies to change their operations to be more energy efficient. Sunk investment costs in current equipment and tools, lack of expertise knowledge, among other constraints, are major obstacles for them, especially for SMEs. What are the help and supporting measures MSE would offer businesses to increase their energy efficiency? Utility bills are likely to increase despite lower fuel prices due to higher carbon taxes. As we face hotter days and warmer nights, many households are turning to air conditioning and showers to cool themselves down, which result in higher electricity and water bills. What kind of support will the Ministry provide the households with, to help them manage their energy and water consumption more efficiently? Would the Ministry share about its public education outreach and advisories to motivate and help households adopt more green lifestyle habits and transition to more efficient home appliances? Dr Lim Wee Kiak: Chairman, many of us will remember the enthusiasm when Singapore's National Recycling Programme was launched in April 2001. NEA rolled out a team of the public waste collectors (PWCs) were licensed to provide recycling bins and recycling collection services to all Housing and Development Board (HDB) estates, as well as private landed properties and condominiums who were opted into the public waste collection scheme. The 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse and Recycle – form the pillar of NEA's schemes. It developed a suite of initiatives as part of Singapore Green Plan and Zero Waste Masterplan. The aim is to shift attitudes as well as behaviours to make 3Rs the norm for citizens, as well as businesses. NEA also continues to study and develop new ways to close the various resource loops. I note that NEA has been exploring the use of mixed materials from Semakau Landfill, which comprise of incineration ashes and other waste materials, as reclamation fill. There is greater awareness now, among households to support this recycling exercise which is commendable. NEA's 2023 survey on household recycling, showed 72% of households recycle compared to 64% in 2021. There is a greater commitment from individuals to build a sustainability culture by embracing the 3Rs. I would like to ask the Minister what is the current recycling rate? How far are we from our target? What are the current challenges facing the recycling industry and how can the Government help the industry and promote more sustainable recycling as a way of life in Singapore? Ms See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member): It was reported that NEA was considering broader forms of packaging waste under the extended producer responsibility scheme. This is a step in the right direction to achieve Singapore's climate goals. Could the Ministry share the insights gleaned from the Mandatory Packaging Reporting scheme and how they would impact the extended producer responsibility scheme? Could the Ministry provide an update on measures to manage the key waste streams, including packaging waste? Mr Eric Chua (Tanjong Pagar): Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. This has been a mantra that has been ingrained in me from a young age. In my younger days, I had thought that the 3Rs was the gold standard for sustainable living. That misinformed fantasy of mine was smashed when I visited one of Singaporeans' favourite travel destinations: Japan. In Japan, recycling is a ritual. Japanese families meticulously sort their waste into plastic, paper, metal and glass. They follow detailed and stringent guidelines. To recycle a soft drink container, one would have to clean and dry the PET bottle to prevent residual contamination, remove paper labels and metal cap, and deposit each item in different recycling bins. Such societal norms have its roots in a worldview that is a deeply reverent of Mother Nature, something Japanese children learn from a young age. In Singapore, our National Recycling Programme aims to make recycling more convenient, but we do face several challenges. Our Blue Bins are a single-stream system where all recyclables are collected. While this simplifies the process, contamination is a problem, when non-recyclables or items that have yet to be cleaned get thrown in the mix, especially. In fact, contamination rate stands at 40%, significantly diminishing the effectiveness of our recycling system. Some Queenstown residents have also expressed concerns about the limited capacity of recycling bins and the low frequency of collection. In HDB estates, 660-litre bins are used; one bin to each block. Collections take place at least three times a week. Larger 1,800-litre or 2,200-litre side-loader bins are also deployed but collections only happen once a week. For landed properties, each house is provided with a recycling bin, typically ranging from 180 to 240 litres, with weekly collection services. However, bins sometimes overflow before scheduled collections, forcing recyclables to be discarded as trash to maintain cleanliness. Singapore's recycling trucks also lack multiple compartments to keep materials separated. Even if households sort their recyclables, they would still be mixed during collection. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of the system and begs the question of whether additional investments can and should be made in upgrading infrastructure to support better recycling practices. What else can the Ministry do to facilitate Singaporeans in truly embracing the 3Rs as a way of life? Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied): More restaurants now charge for plain water and some price bottled water, the same as sugary drinks. This nudges consumers towards sugar laden beverages, increasing the risk of obesity and diabetes. Free or low cost drinking water should be made more widely available across food and beverage (F&B) outlets, shopping malls, hotline, coffee shops and public spaces. This supports healthier choices and reduces unnecessary costs for consumers. I urge MSE to encourage and work with F&B outlets, coffee shops and malls to provide free, or low cost drinking water as a best practice. MSE should also promote the culture of carrying reusable water bottles as part of Singapore's sustainability efforts. Refilling reusable bottles cuts down our reliance on single use plastics. By nudging businesses, building owners and the public towards these norms, we can help Singaporeans stay hydrated while making choices that benefit their health, their wallets and the environment. Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio): Chairman, the need to invest in climate adaptation measures cannot be more pressing. Could the Ministry provide an update on the progress on coastal protection plans, both on the \"Long Island\" project and site specific studies, together with any early results? What is the progress of PUB's Code of Practice study to develop legislation surrounding coastal protection and how will these measures be appropriately enforced to ensure compliance? How will the Ministry ensure that coastal protection measures are adequately funded? Beyond coastal protection measures, our neighbourhoods have been more vulnerable to floods lately, such as in Bukit Timah in December 2024 and Jalan Seaview in January 2025. Could the Ministry also provide an update on plans to upgrade drainage infrastructure and enhance flood resilience? How is the Ministry engaging communities to ensure that Singapore continues to be flood ready? And can there be any tech-enabled solutions to keep Singaporeans apprised of potential flooding in a timely manner? Ms Poh Li San: Chairman, climate change is causing more frequent and extreme rain events, which have led to flash floods in various parts of our island. We need to be prepared against floods inland due to rainfall and coastal floods from sea level rise. We are experiencing more sudden and heavy rainfalls which leave homeowners and businesses with less time to react, such as putting up protective barriers. Will the Minister share what measures will be implemented to better protect buildings in low-lying areas, buildings with basements and underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations against floods? Would the Ministry provide an update on the plans to upgrade our drainage infrastructure to enhance our flood resilience? How is the Ministry engaging members of the public to increase their awareness and ensure that Singaporeans are well prepared in the event of floods? Dr Lim Wee Kiak: Chairman, driving along Bukit Timah Road during rainy season was once the bane of motorists, not to mention residents living in the low-lying areas. Then, in 2019, with some fanfare, the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal was completed after seven years and $300 million spent. The 3.2-kilometre canal could take 30% more rainwater than previously. Sadly, today, flash floods after a heavy downpour has become more common. And flash floods are occurring not just in Bukit Timah, but also across the island. One explanation given is this is due to rapid urbanisation and the other is the unpredictability of heavy downpours, with the torrent of water swiftly filling up our canals and drains. Whatever the real causes, we should analyse the current flooding patterns and use technology to predict future flooding patterns and recommend solutions to mitigate the impact. Can MSE give flood risk scores to properties in Singapore? This will allow for more collaborations between these properties owners to manage their flood risks. In managing flood prone areas, does solving one area flooding problem result in adjacent areas or downstream flooding of another area? Can the Minister provide an update on plans to upgrade our drainage infrastructure and enhance flood resilience? How is the Ministry engaging communities to ensure that Singapore continues to be flood-ready? Could the Ministry provide an update on the progress on coastal protection plans and how will the Ministry ensure the coastal protection standards are met? Ms Poh Li San: Chairman, in view of global warming, it is important for Singapore to strengthen our heat resilience. Our densely populated city-state is also experiencing the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Could the Ministry provide an update on heat resilience plans, in view of rising temperatures in Singapore? What measures are being taken to improve the thermal comfort of our public spaces and better protect vulnerable segments of our population and outdoor workers? The Government had launched the OneMillionTrees movement to plant a million more trees across Singapore by 2030. Would the Ministry update us on how many trees have been planted to date and whether we are on track to reach our target? Would the Ministry also share the progress of environmental modelling for new towns and estates to site buildings in ways to optimise wind and air flow? The Chairman: We have had four hours of debate. Order. I propose to take a break now. [(proc text) Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House. (proc text)] Mr Speaker: Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 3.20 pm. Sitting accordingly suspended at 2.59 pm until 3.20 pm. Sitting resumed at 3.20 pm. [(proc text) Debate in Committee of Supply resumed. (proc text)] [(proc text) Head L (cont) – (proc text)] The Chairman: Mr Faisal Manap. Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied): Madam, in the recent Community Disputes Resolution (Amendment) Bill debate, I had cited an example of a long-standing conflict between a group of flat owners and a bakery located in a four-storey HDB block in my Kaki Bukit ward. The residents of three households are affected by the excessive noise and heat from the bakery located on the ground floor. Madam, the issue was first brought to my attention in 2014 when a resident Mr A attended my Meet-the-People Session to seek assistance on the discomfort he faced caused by continuous release of unbearable heat, pungent smell and loud noises emitting from the bakery which he claimed happens daily from 5.00 am to 12.00 midnight. Back then, I made a representation to NEA and HDB Bedok Branch Office. Nine years later, in 2023, Mr A, together with two other residents, Mr B and Mr C, came to see me with similar feedback and I escalated the matter to MND. In October last year, 2024, Mr C returned to see me, citing the situation remains despite the numerous communications with the relevant agencies. He also told me that his two other neighbours have shifted out. This time around, I wrote to SFA to seek assistance. A recent update from SFA dated 27 February 2025 stated that SFA, in collaboration with relevant agencies, had conducted a thorough investigation into the reported disamenities at the mentioned premises. SFA had advised the operator to implement necessary measures to mitigate resultant noise and heat emissions from their food preparation activities. Madam, I would like to seek a couple of clarifications from the Minister related to this issue and would like to put forth a proposal. My clarifications are: how often does SFA receive similar feedback in a year? What are SFA's requirements for bakeries to operate in a HDB residential block emitting the noise and heat levels resulting from their daily operations? My proposal is for SFA to consider bakeries to be regulated with adequate noise control measures as well as sufficient ventilation systems, similar to features like those installed for bakeries located at HDB blocks, so as to be more effective in diffusing heat and vapour. Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang): Madam, as we advance towards a climate-resilient urban planning model, our local farms should not be left behind. In my speech during the Second Reading of the Food Safety and Security Bill in January, I highlighted the crucial role farms play in ensuring Singapore's food security, especially with more frequent extreme weather patterns in future. We should, therefore, equip our farms with effective mitigation measures against climate change. Currently, grants under the 30-by-30 vision predominantly focus on high-tech solutions, leaving a gap in support for low-tech sustainable farming practices. While high-tech innovations have strengthened our food security, we must also recognise the potential of tried and tested low-tech methods that can enhance the resilience of our agricultural sector. Low-tech agricultural practices rooted in traditional knowledge and ecological principles offer cost-effective and sustainable ways to mitigate the effects of climate change. Many of these techniques have been successfully implemented elsewhere worldwide, and Singapore can benefit by adapting them to suit our land-scarce farmscape. A good example is the Back Halloween Farm in France, which employs permaculture to create a high use sustainable system on a small land area. Permaculture mimics natural ecosystem by fostering synergies between crops and animals. This approach includes growing different crops side by side, rotating them accordingly, and designing water channels for natural irrigation. It has proven useful against extreme weather events, despite enduring three consecutive record-breaking dry summers. The farm experienced minimal disruption by interweaving a diverse root network with dense vegetation. The soil retained moisture like a giant sponge, shielding crops from extreme weather. Moreover, this technique has proven more effective per square metre than conventional mechanised farming, garnering interest from scientific institutions worldwide. Similarly, our fish farms can incorporate natural solutions like aqua plants to improve climate resilience. Aqua plants provide shade and cooling, stabilising water temperatures and prevent algae blooms by absorbing excess ammonia while producing oxygen. Importantly, they reduce the risk of hypoxia, oxygen depletion, a significant challenge during Singapore's hotter months when warmer water holds less dissolved oxygen. While technology remains crucial for precise monitoring and control, aqua plants offer a valuable low-tech complement for fish farms. However, such low-tech solutions are not necessarily low cost. Permaculture consultations are offered by local companies like GWS and Habitat Collective but require substantial investment in research, adaptation and implementation to be effective at a commercial scale. The availability of funding for these solutions will provide adequate support for adoption by farmers. In this way, Singapore can build a more resilient and sustainable agricultural sector, better prepared for climate change challenges. Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong): Mdm Chair, Singapore's agri-food industry plays a crucial role in strengthening our food security. However, in today's challenging business climate, rising costs, supply chain disruptions and climate change, our local farms and food businesses need greater support to build resilience and grow sustainably. I would like to ask the Ministry about its plans to help the agri-food industry cope with these challenges. How can we enhance financial support, technology adoption and innovation to improve productivity? Are there further efforts to strengthen our local farm capabilities and help them scale up? A resilient agri-food sector is key to Singapore's food security and we must continue to do better to support this vital industry. Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin: Madam, with more than 90% of our food being imported, our ambitious 30-by-30 goal was set in an attempt to increase food security. However, we have experienced some setbacks, such as reports of vegetable, poultry and fish farms shutting in recent years. I would like to ask the Minister what is the current progress towards the 30-by-30 goal and is the Ministry considering a review of this goal? How is the Government supporting local farms, given the challenging business climate and has the Government seen an increment in the take-up rates of productivity grants? Finally, is MSE working with local community gardeners in our neighbourhoods, for example, through the Eco Fund for Food Security? To uplift the local aquaculture sector, the Singapore Aquaculture Plan was launched in November 2024. I was glad to see that this is a collaborative effort and thank all involved, as aquaculture is yet another demand on our limited sea space which is highly utilised. Can the Ministry provide more details on the initiatives announced in the Singapore Aquaculture Plan, including an update on the exploration of potential sites in the Southern Waters for further studies on integrating closed containment aquaculture systems with open net cage systems for a new hybrid model for fish farming? What regulations are in place to ensure any businesses which set up fish farms in open waters will keep our marine environment clean? Miss Rachel Ong (West Coast): Many grants for Singapore's sustainability, sustainable food sector, such as NEA's Closing the Resource Loop Funding Initiative and SFA's Singapore Food Story, appear to prioritise public agencies and Institutes of Higher Learning. From a broader perspective, the application criteria and evaluation processes can make it challenging for private enterprises to access funding, especially at the critical stage of commercialisation. For instance, requiring a principal investigator's H-index and citation count may not be suitable for startups and private enterprises, which often avoid publishing research due to commercial sensitivities. Additionally, private enterprises are often required to partner public sector performers, leading to complex licensing negotiation that can hinder technology adoption and commercialisation. To fully harness Singapore's innovative potential, could the Government refine grants to better support local startups and SMEs at higher technology readiness levels, easing access to funding by reducing complexities or removing the requirement for public sector partners? If current grants primarily serve Institutes of Higher Learning and public agencies — The Chairman: Please round up, Miss Rachel Ong. Miss Rachel Ong: — would it consider new funding to help innovative private enterprises scale and contribute to sustainability goals? Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): More than 10 years ago, in a 2013 publication, a National Heritage Board (NHB) Community Heritage e-resource on wet markets identified the numerous challenges facing wet market stall-owners, such as competition from hypermarkets, changing consumer profiles, unwillingness of children to take over stalls, significant physical labour and long hours. Over the last few years, wet market stall-owners have cited very high Certificate of Entitlement (COE) prices for commercial vehicles as another reason to fold up their businesses. Despite challenges, some wet markets remain relatively more popular, with Tekka Market and Geylang Serai being good examples. What is the Ministry's long-term plan for wet markets in smaller and localised neighbourhoods which do not command the footfall they once did, and for wet markets where stalls have seen poor take-ups over the last few years? Mr Gan Thiam Poh: Chair, our hawker centres are our national canteens and provide a wide variety of affordable food to suit more palates and budgets. We have had many popular hawker centres sited all over Singapore, which have served residents over many years. Their structures are ageing and some can do well with some upgrading, others may need to be rebuilt to optimise layouts. Would the Ministry share whether there are any plans to upgrade or rebuild any of our hawker centres? Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee): Since its opening in the 1970s, Marsiling Lane Market and Food Centre has been well patronised by Singaporeans, especially those living in Marsiling and Woodgrove. In recent years, the surrounding neighbourhood has been transforming rapidly. The HDB's rejuvenation of Heartland project wrapped up last year. A new Marsiling Community Club will be in operation from next year, and we are welcoming several new BTOs in the area. Against this backdrop, Senior Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad and I, as Members of Parliament (MPs) for Marsiling and Woodgrove divisions, respectively, often get asked by residents whether and when the market and hawker centre can get a rejuvenation too. Rejuvenation would be ideal, especially since the hawker centre is thriving and packed on weekends. Such rejuvenation ought to, on the one hand, further improve the customer experience for everyone, including younger folks, while keeping food prices and wet market shopping affordable. On the other hand, we would have to consider how these heartland markets are often quiet on weekdays and at night. Should we then expect hawkers to stay open during those periods? Shops also face stiff competition from Johor Bahru, which is proximate and convenient for Singaporeans, especially those residing in the north to head to. How can we make the hawker and wet market experience in Marsiling more attractive, especially with the Rapid Transit System (RTS) coming and worries that business might take a hit? What are NEA's plans to help hawkers and stores stay competitive? For a start, we should upgrade all hawker centres to meet the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark standards to create a better environment for hawkers and patrons. We could also set up a hawker agency to manage these centres, encourage hawker entrepreneurship, and boost food and service quality, including healthier options. That way, our hawker centres and wet markets can thrive. And we can continue to keep our hawker culture alive. Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin: Madam, hawker centres and markets are an institution, a gem in our heartlands for generations. Many a spirited debate has ensued over which area has the best mee rebus, freshest fruits and tastiest \"kopi peng\". To that, I would put forward that the answer is in Ang Mo Kio. With the inscription of hawker culture in the UNESCO list, hawkers are in the spotlight, but many are growing older and struggling with both cost pressures and legacy challenges as it is not easy to attract and sustain younger players. Could the Ministry provide an update on its efforts to celebrate and sustain the hawker trade while carrying on the legacies of hawkers approaching retirement, given the lack of successors entering the trade? How are we supporting both hawkers and wet market stallholders to remain competitive in the current cost environment? I am grateful for the Hawker Centre Transformation Programme (HTP), which was helpful in upgrading older markets, such as the Cheng San Market and Cook Food Centre in Ang Mo Kio. Older hawker centres often have fundamental infrastructure issues which are hard to resolve through regular Repair and Redecoration (R&R) works and persistent challenges such as urban birds, heat and drainage. I would like to ask what learnings can be derived from the first batch of the HTP. How else can we more comprehensively upgrade our hawker centres to keep them clean and cool for generations to come? The Chairman: Mr Eric Chua, you can take your two cuts together. Mr Eric Chua: Madam, hawker centres play a crucial role in Singapore's culinary and cultural landscape, serving as a cornerstone of our local food culture. Hawker centres provide affordable, good-quality meals and serve as communal spaces where people from all walks of life gather. Whenever I seek budget-friendly and delicious food, hawker centres are my go-to choice. However, while regulations governing our hawker centres today have generally served us well, I would like to ask the Ministry if some rethinking of our rules might be opportune, especially in view of the need to adapt to the changing realities confronting our hawkers today. A significant challenge among our hawkers today is their physical self. Many hawkers are getting on in years and are not as physically able as before. Many veteran hawkers, who have spent decades perfecting their craft, now find it increasingly difficult to work long hours. As a result, many stalls in some hawker centres close by the late afternoon, and this translates to reduced food options and overall foot traffic to these hawker centres. This not only impacts individual stallholders' revenue but also affects the vibrancy and appeal of these centres as our community hubs. To optimise stall utilisation and address this challenge, may I suggest that MSE consider the implementation of a new policy that would allow for two different sets of stallholders to operate the same stall, in accordance with a two-shift system. To be sure, this calls for careful planning: food types sold across the two shifts should ideally be complementary; and infrastructural provisions such as allocated storage areas or spaces for the preparation of food must be redesigned. However, should these teething challenges be successfully worked through, such an arrangement would enable different hawkers to operate the same stall at different times of the day, thereby ensuring the continuity of food options for consumers and retaining the vibrancy of our hawker centres for a much longer stretch of the day. On a related note, many successful hawkers have built strong brand recognition, with many loyal customers seeking out their food. However, the inability to operate beyond two stalls restricts their ability to meet demand. Under today's provisions, hawkers can appoint a joint operator or a nominee. However, I understand that some hawkers are still hesitant about doing so. Could the Ministry share more from its engagement with hawkers the general reasons for not readily embracing the joint tenancy or nominee model, and what the NEA or MSE might be able to do to address these concerns? Regular reviews and recalibration of existing frameworks will ensure that hawker centres remain accessible, sustainable and adaptable to the evolving needs of hawkers and consumers alike. By fostering a more flexible and forward-looking approach, we can continue to uphold Singapore's rich hawker heritage while ensuring its long-term viability for future generations. Mr Eric Chua: Madam, I am Hokkien, and Hokkien mee is one of my favourite hawker food. I recently ate my first plate of Hokkien mee that was not cooked by a human hawker. No, not a paranormal encounter. My Hokkien mee was cooked by a robot, named Wok AI. To my surprise, the Hokkien mee was delicious, just a touch lacking in \"wok hei\", something that even Chip, the engineer-turned-hawkerpreneur has been working on, and by now, he might already have \"cracked the code\" to achieve ideal \"wok hei\". Madam, my cut is not about \"wok hei\" but how technology can help us sustain our hawker culture. Technology can reduce the physical strain on senior hawkers, allowing them to focus on quality control. It could also ensure consistency in taste and consumers might even be able to personalise our dishes. Fancy a plate of Hokkien mee that is 20% spicy, 50% moist, 30% \"wok hei\", just 3% oily, for Healthier SG's sake? I therefore hope the Ministry can strengthen support for our hawkers in technology adoption, and in so doing, preserve our much beloved hawker culture for many more generations to come. Ms Hany Soh: Madam, 2024 was designated as the Year of Public Hygiene (YOPH) to show Singapore's commitment to better public cleanliness and hygiene. Could the Ministry please provide an update on how YOPH has turned out? When it comes to public hygiene, the Ministry should continue its focus on particularly these three areas: one, tackling high-rise littering; two, dealing with unhygienic public toilets; and three, reducing waste. These steps can cut down the risk of community disease outbreaks from things like rats, pigeons, stray wildlife and mosquitoes. Can the Ministry update us on its plans and efforts in this regard? For example, with high-rise littering, how fast does the agency act to set up surveillance cameras when residents say the problems keep popping up? Could the Ministry boost its resources to speed up deployment and enforcement? In November 2024, I attended the Waterloo finale of results of National Survey on toilets in Singapore. It was a project led by the Singapore Management University's Rosie Ching, principal lecturer of statistics, with her 222 undergraduate students from her Statistics X course. They conducted on-site surveys to check toilet cleanliness across Singapore's public spaces. The survey looked at 2,602 toilets in 1,428 spots, across coffee shops, hawker centres, MRT stations and shopping malls, and interviewed 4,905 people, including 510 employees, and 4,395 customers about the sentiment on the public toilets conditions. Even with efforts to raise hygiene standard last year, coffee shop toilets were slightly worse than in 2023. In my closing address at the event, I shared that public hygiene is something we all share responsibility for. It is not just the Government, but operators, cleaners, users, the general public including you and I, can all step up to push for cleaner public toilets. I would therefore urge the Government to team up with these passionate students, continue to engage and interview other stakeholders, not just to point out how dirty our public toilets are, but to come up with long-term fixes. We need an outcome-based approach to make sure all public toilets are functional, clean and hygienic. Too many toilet facilities that stay under repair for ages leaves people without option. The Government could also consider setting up an endowment fund to keep funding efforts to transform toilets, making them clean, safe and barrier free, especially for our ageing population. Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Madam, for years, I have spoken up repeatedly in this House, calling for the Government to take action to protect the lives of fellow Singaporeans from second-hand smoke. I have spoken up so much that Senior Minister of State Amy Khor once said that she is immune to me already. But on a more serious note, this is a serious issue. It is not about how many people have complained about this issue but quite starkly, about how many people have died. Based on the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study shared by the Ministry of Health (MOH), about one death every other day in Singapore is attributable to second-hand smoke. This is not about the luxury of having fresh air to breathe or nice-smelling air. This is a matter of life and death for so many people who depend on us sitting here to protect them. It is time for us to legislate and ban smoking at windows and balconies so that fewer people will die from second-hand smoke. Ms Poh Li San: Madam, last year, SFA and NEA took more than 1,200 enforcement actions against owners of premises for the lack of public toilet cleanliness, compared to over 360 in 2023. A Public Toilets Task Force was set up in 2024 to study and recommend solutions to improve the cleanliness of poorly performing public toilets. Can the Ministry give an assessment of whether the Taskforce's recommendations will be considered or implemented? Coffee shop toilets have been ranked the filthiest consistently for years. How will the Ministry get their owners and operators to sign up for the Toilet Improvement Programme, which provides up to 90% co-funding to improve their toilet designs, install sanitary fittings or adopt technology to facilitate cleaning and maintenance? The Chairman: Mr Gan Thiam Poh, please take your four cuts together. Mr Gan Thiam Poh: The Public Toilets Task Force (PTTF) was established in March 2024 to study and recommend ways to improve the cleanliness of public toilets in Singapore. Would the Ministry share its views of the recommendations in its recently released report? Will the stakeholders, such as coffeeshop operators, owners and cleaning companies, be able to go onboard the new cleaning framework? Although Singapore is still considered a clean and green city, problems of littering still remain. In fact, like other Members, I personally received many complaints from my residents. As many had commented before, Singapore is not so much a clean city per se, but a cleaned one, with many hardworking cleaners picking up after litterbugs. How will the Ministry tackle this problem and reduce the cases of littering? Parks, beaches and public toilets are some of the cleanliness hotspots in Singapore. How will the Ministry address the hygiene problems at these locations as well as at others, such as parts of Chinatown and certain hawker centres? Will customised solutions be required to address the different causes and contributing factors to low standards of cleanliness at these sites? The Project Wolbachia has been a great success. The initial results from the multi-site field study show that residents living in these sites where the scheme had been launched are about 75% less likely to be infected with dengue. May I ask when the residents of Fernvale, in my constituency, can benefit from this programme? The Chairman: Mr Eric Chua, take your two cuts together, please. Mr Eric Chua: Madam, Project Wolbachia is presently in Phase 5 of its implementation. I fully support the project and its continued implementation. However, for some residents, especially those whose homes are on lower floors, living with the constant release of male Wolbachia mosquitoes has caused some inconveniences. While I usually share NEA's advisory that they do not have to exercise restraint in swatting mosquitoes they come across, few found solace in my advice. One resident with sensitive skin even purportedly developed rashes because of the increased mosquito population. To be sure, the NEA has reported laudable outcomes from the project thus far, Aedes mosquito population at study locations has dropped by up to 80% to 90% and findings from a multi-site field study revealed a 75% decrease in risks of contracting dengue. Residents in nearby areas have also been found to have a 45% lower risk of contracting dengue than those in areas without releases, indicating that the advantages go beyond immediate zones. Would the MSE and NEA then be able to help ameliorate the disamenities that residents face with the project's implementation? Madam, rat sightings in Singapore are not uncommon. In Queenstown, residents have raised concerns regarding rodent problems in their estates. In a few particularly severe cases, rats have chewed through car wires, causing significant damage to vehicles, resulting in damages amounting to thousands of dollars in repair costs. Such incidents not only result in unnecessary financial burden for vehicle owners, but more importantly, highlight broader public hygiene, health and safety concerns. Working with the Town Council, my team and I actively monitor and work to reduce the number of rat burrows in our estate. We collect and analyse data regularly to implement strategies that help control and reduce the problem in each precinct. A municipal task force convenes regularly and reducing rat burrows is a standing agenda item. This structured approach helps us assess the effectiveness of measures taken and adjust our approaches for better outcomes. However, the financial challenges of running the Town Council remain high, with significant resources already allocated to pest control efforts. While traditional methods, such as baiting and manual trapping provide some level of control, they may not be sufficient for long-term effectiveness. Given these challenges, there is a pressing need to explore more advanced and efficient rat control solutions. These modern techniques can possibly include the use of smart traps and biological controls, which have been proven to be more environmentally sustainable and effective as well. I therefore would like to appeal to the MSE to provide their assessment on the rat situation in Singapore and to review the possibility of assisting Town Councils defray costs associated with implementing the more innovative, albeit costlier pest-control solutions. With more support, we can embrace more effective and environmentally friendly methods, and at the same time, comprehensively nip the rat problem in the bud. Ms Poh Li San: Mdm Chair, the Ministry has many areas of responsibility, from water adequacy to food safety, cleanliness to climate change, just to name a few. Much of its work also involves engaging and responding to the public's tip-offs, alerts and feedback, such as in the event of water leakages, floods and canal chokes, food issues, trees falling, animal abuse and so on. How does the Ministry plan to leverage social media and mobile apps, AI, information technology (IT), technology and automation in its work to improve its productivity? For areas which will benefit from real-time monitoring, such as flooding, is the Ministry investing in enough equipment and resources to ensure that we have access to timely and reliable data to act on? Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin: Madam, as we continue to look for innovative ways to improve the quality of life in our neighbourhoods, we have seen how technology can play an important role in enhancing efficiency and service delivery. One key area where technology can make a real difference in supporting MSE is in tackling everyday challenges, such as monitoring cleanliness and pest control. We have already seen some examples, such as in NEA's optical surveillance cameras dedicated to combat high rise littering or thermal imagery to detect smoking offences – although perhaps, not enough, per Member Louis Ng's speech earlier. I hope more of such technologies can be used to better protect our neighbourhoods at scale and complement the work of Town Councils. Can the Ministry share how it intends to dial up the use of technology and AI to enable MSE's work, for example, through monitoring cleanliness in poorer performing areas, as well as tackling pigeon, urban bird and rodent issues in our neighbourhoods and, in particular, private estates, where cleaners are required to clean a network of streets which are sometimes confusing and have roadside barriers? The Chairman: Minister Grace Fu. The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien): Mdm Chair, I would first like to thank all Members who have shown interest in MSE's work and filed cuts with us. As we mark SG60, looking back at the last 60 years, it is not difficult to note the progress we have made since Independence. We laid the foundations for a modern metropolis, cleaning up our waterways and environment, putting in place a modern sanitation system, reducing flood risks and improving food safety. Our hawker centres remain an important source of affordable food, a cherished social space for many Singaporeans and a proud showcase of our food heritage for friends visiting from abroad. We have also harnessed science and technology through NEWater and desalination to strengthen our water resilience and developed Project Wolbachia to fight dengue and improve public health. The green and liveable city we enjoy today is the collective result of our boldness and our resilience over the past six decades. Since our Independence, we have pursued economic growth in tandem with environmental protection and social inclusion. It is a careful balancing act, one that requires boldness in decision-making and the resilience to rise above our constraints. MSE's work is vital in safeguarding the food we eat, the water we drink, and the environment we live, work and play in. At the core, our work is about \"Our Sustainability, Our Resilience, Our Everyday.\" \"Our Sustainability\" is to steward our limited resources responsibly for future generations. \"Our Resilience\" is to prepare for and adapt to new challenges. And \"Our Everyday\" is to improve the daily living of Singaporeans, and our daily interaction with our environment, present and future. In this debate, we will touch on these areas. First, our sustainability. Improving energy efficiency is critical in our drive towards net zero. Everyone can play a part in improving our energy efficiency. Being more energy efficient will help us conserve energy, allowing us to grow our economy and population with less energy and carbon emission. We will support households and industries in pursuing energy efficiency improvements. For businesses, we have expanded energy efficiency grants to cover more sectors, such as construction and manufacturing sectors. We have also enhanced regulatory frameworks for various sectors, such as the buildings and industry sectors. For households, the enhanced Climate Friendly Households Programme will be expanded to benefit more households and encourage wider adoption of resource efficient household products. The public sector is also pressing ahead with its plan to improve the energy efficiency of its buildings. Senior Minister of State Khor will share more. Ms Poh Li San asked how we intend to manage air-conditioning use. Against the backdrop of a warmer planet, it is crucial that we manage our thermal comfort sustainably. Very often, our indoor spaces are so cold that we need to wear sweaters in tropical Singapore. A major step is to keep indoor air-conditioned spaces at 25°C or higher. This will reduce energy cost and allow occupants to dress more appropriately for our climate. The public sector has adopted this where possible, and we hope for partner businesses and the public to make a broader shift towards sustainable cooling. More details will be announced later this year. Next, our resilience. Climate change poses a serious and considerable threat to Singapore. We will launch a $25 million Weather Science Research Programme to enhance Singapore's ability to understand and predict our tropical urban weather, including extreme weather arising from climate change. Under this programme, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore will collaborate with local Institutes of Higher Learning and Research Institutes to incorporate the latest scientific and technological developments; for example, in the use of AI to improve our ability to forecast better. Just as we have risen to past challenges, we need to work together with purpose, with urgency and with determination to strengthen our climate resilience. I will speak about flood, coastal and heat resilience, while Senior Minister of State Khor and Senior Minister of State Koh will cover water and food resilience respectively. First, flood and coastal resilience. In our early days of Independence, Singapore faced frequent and widespread flooding during the monsoon seasons. Over the years, we have reduced flood-prone areas from around 3,200 hectares in the 1970s to less than 25 hectares today – and that is a 99% reduction. You may recall that in January this year, Singapore experienced two monsoon surges which brought prolonged rain. Over both monsoon surges, there was just one reported flood incident. Our progress in flood resilience is significant. However, climate change will pose new challenges. As such, we will upgrade our infrastructure to enhance our flood resilience. We can expect six more drainage upgrading projects this year. Later this year, upgrading works for the Sungei Serangoon Western and Eastern subsidiary drains are slated to commence, to cater for upcoming developments in the Lorong Halus area. That said, in land-scarce Singapore, we cannot keep expanding our drainage infrastructure. We must strengthen flood resilience at the systems level, and partner building owners, developers and the wider community. For individual developments, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) works closely with building owners and developers to implement, operate and maintain flood-protection measures. For underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations and buildings with basements, PUB works with them to meet requirements on minimum platform and crest levels. PUB also engages residents and businesses in flood-prone areas and hotspots on flood risks and distributes flood protection devices to enhance flood protection for these premises. To update Singaporeans on potential flooding, PUB leverages the myENV mobile app, social media, radio broadcast and traditional media outlets to disseminate timely updates. There are also plans to enable the ERP 2.0 on-board units in our vehicles to display flood alerts by mid-2025. As we enhance our inland flood resilience, we need to build coastal protection in tandem. Members asked about the status of our coastal protection plans, legislation and standards. To guide our plans, we are conducting site-specific studies. The studies for Jurong Island, City-East Coast, including \"Long Island\", as well as the northwest coast from Tuas to Woodlands are on track. More details for the Greater Southern Waterfront and Changi will be shared later this year. We will commence the studies for Sentosa and the southwest coast by 2026. Ms Nadia Samdin also asked how we will fund our coastal protection efforts. The Government plans to use funds from our annual Budget, the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, to which the Minister for Finance has announced a $5 billion fund top-up, and through borrowing. Where eligible, such as for land reclamation costs, we will also use the Past Reserves. We will continue to study how best to finance these measures in a way that is fiscally sustainable and equitable across generations. It is more effective to build up flood resilience at a system's level, where coastal stakeholders play their part alongside the Government. We are preparing a coastal protection legislation to set out the responsibilities of relevant stakeholders, safeguard land for coastal protection measures and ensure that coastal protection standards are met. We will consult stakeholders and table a Coastal Protection Bill in the second half of 2025. PUB is developing a Code of Practice that will provide a set of design standards as well as operation and maintenance requirements for coastal protection measures. We will consult the industry this year and aim to release it by the first half of 2026. PUB will also launch a Flood-Resilient Developments guidebook to help building owners enhance the resilience of their premises. The guidebook will contain case studies and a toolkit of flood-resilient measures that owners can consider adopting for their buildings. Next, on heat resilience. As we experience rising temperatures, building heat resilience is a critical part of our adaptation efforts. Ms Poh asked about our heat resilience efforts. We are progressively rolling out infrastructural interventions to enhance heat resilience. HDB will work closely with the Town Councils to apply cool coatings to all existing HDB estates island-wide by 2030. We are studying the effectiveness of cool coatings to other infrastructure archetypes, such as schools and hawker centres. We will find ways to improve thermal comfort for the public, such as enhancing greenery and ventilation, and reducing heat emission. Infrastructural interventions, however, need to be complemented with individual actions. Thermal comfort is subjective and our bodies respond differently. A key tenet of our heat resilience efforts is about empowering people. The Heat Stress Advisory was launched in 2023 to guide the public on steps to protect themselves, based on the prevailing heat stress levels. Recognising that heat affects various groups of people differently, depending on the nature of their activities, the Heat Stress Advisory is supported by sector-specific guidelines, such as the Ministry of Manpower's revised framework to protect outdoor workers. Underpinning these guidelines is our Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature heat stress sensor network. I am happy to share that we are expanding our sensor network beyond sports stadiums to cover residential areas. This will provide more accurate information so that our advisory can be more effective. The expanded heat stress sensor network will also provide more timely information on extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. We have developed heatwave response plans for both public and sector-specific populations. Assoc Prof Razwana asked about our collaboration with partners. We do so through platforms, such as the C40 network of about 100 cities that are looking for solutions on climate change. We also partner with researchers to deepen our understanding of how heat impacts our health and to co-create innovative solutions, such as developing wearables, for better heat stress monitoring. I have touched on our efforts for flood, coastal and heat resilience. These are important parts of Singapore's national adaptation plan, which countries are encouraged to develop in line with international best practices. In the face of increasing yet uncertain climate risks, the national adaptation plan will serve as a long-term, living strategy for Singapore to continue thriving in the future. Through our ongoing and upcoming engagements, we hope to hear views from the community and stakeholders too. Lastly, our efforts to safeguard our everyday. The journey towards a sustainable and resilient Singapore is not just about preparing for long-term challenges. We must not lose sight of the importance of our everyday behaviour. This was why we designated 2024 as the Year of Public Hygiene – to highlight the importance of public hygiene and, more importantly, to harness the spirit of collective responsibility in adopting good public hygiene practices for the betterment of our society. We have achieved commendable outcomes. We saw a 36% reduction of litter between May 2024 and December 2024 at littering hotspots, thanks to increased public education as well as enforcement efforts. My Ministry also recently received the Public Toilets Taskforce's report. We have studied the taskforce's recommendations and decided to endorse them. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng will share more on this. Hawker centres are also an important part of our everyday. In the early days, street hawkers were resettled into hawker centres to improve food hygiene standards and public health. Hawker centres have remained an important source of affordable food and an integral part of our culture, serving as vibrant community dining rooms for Singaporeans and visitors from all walks of life. Over time, as our people's needs evolve, our hawker centres have to be revitalised and future-ready. With climate change, an ageing population, rapid urban redevelopments and shifting hawker profiles, patrons and hawkers have new expectations. Hawkers also require more productive and innovative solutions to meet their business aspirations and tackle operational challenges. As demographics shift, some hawker centres in the mature estates have experienced falling demand. At the same time, new estates have emerged and may need more affordable eating options. The Minister for Finance has announced that we will allocate up to $1 billion to upgrade old hawker centres and build new ones. We will do these progressively over the next 20 to 30 years, to serve the changing needs of Singaporeans. New hawker centres will be built as needed, with modern and sustainable services and spaces. Under a new Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme 2.0 (HUP 2.0), existing hawker centres will be transformed. Madam, in Mandarin please. (In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] The Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme 2.0 aims to create a more conducive dining and working environment for patrons and hawkers respectively. We aim to make hawker centres more inclusive and accessible for all, including seniors and persons with disabilities. We also want to uplift hawker centres’ infrastructure to be ready for climate change. Some hawker centres located in mature housing estates may undergo more extensive rebuilding works. Where possible, this will be done in tandem with estate development plans, so that our hawker centres are better suited to residents’ needs, and keep pace with the times and local circumstances. (In English): Senior Minister of State Koh will share more later about our plans. Let me conclude. The road ahead will not be easy. We will face challenges that will test our adaptability – climate change, geopolitical tensions and disease outbreaks. But our Singapore story has always been one of resilience, of a people who refuse to be daunted by our limitations, who turn challenges into opportunities and who forge ahead with boldness. MSE's theme for the debate, \"Our Sustainability, Our Resilience, Our Everyday\", is not just about the policies and infrastructure, but also about our people and the everyday choices we make. It is about the businesses that embrace green investments and innovation, the households that recycle waste, the individuals who champion sustainability and the communities that look out for one another. Every effort, no matter how small, strengthens our resilience and secures our future. Let us build on our strong foundation and press on with boldness and confidence. Just as past generations laid the groundwork for the green and livable Singapore we enjoy today, let us do our part to ensure that future generations will look back with pride at the choices we made. Together, we can shape a Singapore that remains not only a thriving nation, but also a home that is sustainable, resilient and full of potential. [Applause.] The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Amy Khor. The Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan): Chairman, recent events such as forest fires in California and heatwaves across Southeast Asia have shown that climate change demands decisive action for our sustainability. We will advance green initiatives, improve energy efficiency and promote resource resilience to progress towards our ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to achieve net-zero by 2050. Assoc Prof Razwana Begum asked how MSE will promote sustainable practices and technologies across the public and private sectors. Let me share the Government's efforts to achieve our net-zero targets. The Government has committed to achieve net-zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of our national target. We published the second edition of the GreenGov.SG report for FY2023, which incorporates waste data and contextualises the public sector's resource footprint. This allows us to develop targeted pathways to reduce and remove emissions. A key strategy to reduce emissions is to improve energy efficiency across different sectors of the economy. For the public sector, we have earlier announced plans to reduce our Energy Utilisation Index (EUI) by 10% by 2030 from FY2018 to FY2020 baseline. As of FY2023, we have achieved 3.7% EUI reduction and we will do more to reach our target. To bolster our efforts, the Government will, from this year, set aside around $300 million for an Energy Efficiency Fund for public sector buildings. The fund will invest in worthwhile projects over the next five years, to improve energy efficiency performance of public sector facilities. These projects will contribute toward our climate targets, payback through life-cycle cost-savings and generate excess savings for the Government in the long term. Eligible projects could include retrofits to energy consuming systems or installation of smart systems to optimise energy efficiency. Public sector facilities that could be covered include office premises, hospitals and MRT stations. An example of a worthwhile project would be Tan Tock Seng Hospital's mini-chiller heat recovery system. The system saves 800,000kWh of electricity, or $240,000 a year, by replacing energy-consuming electric heaters with heat generated from the mini chiller. The fund can facilitate the test-bedding of innovative and cost-effective solutions that could stimulate growth and help build industry capability in energy services for the built environment sector. Public sector leadership in this area could catalyse energy efficiency improvements in the larger stock of private sector buildings. Besides reducing emissions, another key strategy is to remove residual emissions. NEA is studying solutions to capture carbon emissions at our Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plants. A pilot project will be launched by 2026 to validate the carbon capture technologies, such as amine-based absorption for our WtE plants and to inform our next steps. We are also looking to leverage Government procurement to normalise green initiatives throughout our businesses. To this end, we announced last year that we would refine our environmental sustainability evaluation criteria for large construction and information and communications technology (ICT) hardware tenders. I am pleased to share that from FY2024, up to 5% of tender evaluation criteria have been set aside for environmental sustainability considerations. BCA and GovTech have shared the refined sustainability evaluation criteria with Government agencies for adoption in their tenders. We shared last year that we planned to expand our sustainability evaluation criteria for public sector meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE) tenders. This will be implemented from FY2025 for Government procurement of events venues and events management services. Beyond introducing environmental sustainability evaluation criteria in tenders, we are also looking to drive green procurement in other categories, such as facility management, through incorporating broader environmental sustainability considerations. For example, JTC is working with agencies to explore incentive payments for facility management vendors who excel in energy and water efficiency in their managed assets. Assoc Prof Razwana and Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked how the Government can support businesses in their efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate climate impacts. As Mr Gan Thiam Poh mentioned, helping businesses to improve their energy efficiency is key to lowering business costs and improving economic competitiveness. The Government has introduced support schemes, such as the Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG), to support businesses in improving energy efficiency by co-funding investments in energy-efficient equipment. We expanded the EEG in 2024 to cover more sectors, such as construction, manufacturing, maritime and data centres. Since introducing the EEG in September 2022, the Government has approved nearly 11,000 applications from over 4,000 businesses. This has resulted in positive cost savings and sustainability outcomes. For example, United E&P Pte Ltd, a manufacturing company, replaced their asphalt crusher with an energy-efficient model. This change saves about $48,000 of energy costs annually and reduces lifetime carbon emissions by 1,000 tonnes. To enhance energy efficiency of our industrial sector, which is Singapore’s largest energy-consuming sector, we amended the Energy Conservation Act last year to extend Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) for chilled water systems to existing industrial facilities. From April 2026, we will raise the MEES for water-cooled chilled water systems dedicated for space cooling in new industrial facilities to BCA's standards for space cooling in new commercial buildings under the Code for Environmental Sustainability (ES) of Buildings Edition 4.0. This is to align energy efficiency standards across sectors, ease regulatory compliance for businesses and improve industrial energy efficiency. With the revised energy efficiency standards, each new industrial facility can expect annual energy savings of $63,000 and above over the 15-year lifespan of chilled water systems. The short payback period of 1.5 years also makes installing energy-efficient chilled water systems more cost-effective. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked how we can support households amid rising utilities costs. The Climate Friendly Households Programme (CFHP) will help support households to improve resource efficiency. Last year, CFHP was enhanced to provide all HDB households in Singapore with $300 worth of Climate Vouchers for purchases from among 10 types of resource-efficient household products. As of 31 January 2025, around 80% of eligible HDB households, that is, around 850,000 households, have claimed their Climate Vouchers. Approximately $88 million of climate vouchers have been utilised. The top three household appliances purchased were direct current fans, refrigerators and washing machines. This translates to annual energy savings that can power 19,000 4-rooms HDB flats and annual water savings equivalent to 900 Olympic-sized swimming pools, or about $31 million in annual utility savings. To encourage greater involvement in climate action, the Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Statement that the Government will provide an additional $100 of Climate Vouchers to eligible households, on top of the existing $300. We will also expand the enhanced CFHP to include Singapore Citizen households living in private residential properties. This means that each eligible household will, in total, receive $400 of Climate Vouchers. The expansion will benefit around 250,000 more households, on top of the 1.1 million HDB households that are already covered under the enhanced CFHP. These enhancements will be available from 15 April 2025. To support our heartland entrepreneurs, MSE has onboarded about 170 retailers, of which, 130 are heartland retailers. Climate Vouchers can be used at over 520 outlets to provide greater accessibility to households. Our net-zero targets necessitate the promotion of sustainable consumption and production practices. This requires us to reduce resource consumption, reuse where possible, before recycling. Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Eric Chua asked how we can promote the 3Rs as a way of life. Ms Jean See asked for an update on our measures to manage key waste streams, including packaging waste. We have made significant strides in facilitating waste reduction. Our domestic waste generated per capita, and non-domestic waste generated per dollar GDP decreased by more than 15% and 30% respectively over the past decade. This indicates that households and businesses have taken positive steps to reduce, reuse and recycle. Our overall recycling rate remained largely steady at around 60% between 2013 and 2019. There was a sharp decline during the COVID-19 period and was at 52% in 2023. The recent decline in recycling rate is largely driven by structural factors, such as transport costs, market volatility for recyclables like paper, and foreign government restrictions on the trade in recyclables. These are challenges we must contend with as we work towards closing our resource loop. We will study how we can work together with and support the recycling industry to increase the recycling rate of our key waste streams. One key measure to reduce waste generation and improve recycling is Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), which helps to aggregate clean streams of recyclables. An upcoming EPR scheme is the beverage container return scheme. NEA has issued the producer responsibility scheme operator licence to BCRS Ltd, a not-for-profit company formed by a consortium of beverage producers comprising Coca-Cola, F&N Foods and Pokka. The scheme will commence in April 2026. Steady progress is being made to this end. BCRS Ltd has called for proposals for the scheme’s IT system, counting and sorting system and the return point network. They have also appointed two small producer representatives to their board of directors to represent smaller producers. BCRS Ltd will set up more than 1,000 conveniently placed return points to facilitate our recycling journey. Alongside EPR schemes, companies are also required to submit plans to reduce packaging use, promote reusables and facilitate collection of packaging for reuse or recycling as part of their Mandatory Packaging Reporting (MPR) submissions. MPR seeks to raise companies’ awareness of the packaging waste that they generate and spur them to take concrete steps to reduce it. Companies have taken heed of this call to action. In 2024, NEA supported the launch of an Alliance for Action (AfA) on Packaging Waste Reduction for the e-commerce sector. Led by Singapore Manufacturing Federation and Singapore Post, the AfA comprised 14 members across the e-commerce supply chain. The AfA estimates that, in Singapore, about 186,000 parcels were delivered per day in 2023, generating as much as 15,900 tonnes of mailing packaging in that year alone. Given the continued growth of this sector, I am pleased to announce that the AfA has developed the Guidelines on Sustainable E-commerce Packaging to guide companies on sustainable packaging practices. The Guidelines provide a comprehensive list of 3R solutions for common packaging types, such as cardboard boxes, mailers and fillers. These solutions are rated based on effort required, cost and environmental impact. Companies can adopt solutions that best suit their needs to achieve cost savings and minimise environmental impact. For example, Watsons Singapore reduced its use of bubble wrap by repurposing shredded used cardboard boxes as filler material, saving up to 10% in overall packaging procurement costs. Another example is Sealed Air, who found that with more direct deliveries, the amount of material used in its plastic and paper mailers could be reduced by 30% to 50%. We hope that more e-commerce businesses will make good use of these guidelines, which can be downloaded from the Packaging Partnership Programme website. On Mr Gerald Giam’s suggestion to provide free or low-cost drinking water to reduce plastic waste, tap water in Singapore is safe for drinking. Water dispensers are also readily available at hawker centres and in common areas, such as parks, bus interchanges and terminals, where one can simply fill up with a reusable which we have been promoting. As we press on towards a sustainable and circular economy, we must also continue to strengthen our water resilience. Most Members would be familiar with our water supply infrastructure, like our desalination plants, reservoirs and waterways. Fewer might be familiar with the essential role that our used water infrastructure plays in supporting our water supply needs. Our water demand is about 440 million gallons a day today and is expected to almost double by 2065. With rising water demand, more used water will be generated. So, in tandem, we have to expand our used water conveyance and treatment capacity. To address the need for more used water conveyance capacity, PUB has been expanding the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS). The DTSS is an underground superhighway that will convey used water by gravity to three centralised water reclamation plants located at Changi, Tuas and Kranji. The first phase of the DTSS (DTSS 1) was completed in 2008 and serves the northern and eastern regions of Singapore. The second phase of the DTSS (DTSS 2), which is under construction, will serve the western region of Singapore and will be operational by 2027. When completed, the DTSS will free up 150 hectares of land for other purposes by phasing out intermediate pumping stations and conventional water reclamation plants. In tandem, we have integrated our used water treatment and NEWater production and are expanding their capacities. Tuas Water Reclamation Plant and Tuas NEWater factories are on track to be completed in phases from 2027. The new Kranji Water Reclamation Plant and Kranji NEWater factory are targeted to be completed by the mid-2030s. The Changi Water Reclamation Plant will also be expanded by the mid-2030s, and the construction of the third Changi NEWater factory is targeted to be completed in the next three years. The three-node used water management system at Changi, Tuas and Kranji will play a critical role in helping to meet Singapore’s long-term needs. Every drop of used water will be collected, treated and purified in an endless cycle, so that we make the best use of our limited resource. Indeed, let this be our calling: zero waste. Chairman, in conclusion, our sustainability requires collective effort. Advancing green initiatives, improving energy efficiency and promoting resource resilience will put us on track to achieve our climate ambitions. The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon. The Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment (Dr Koh Poh Koon): Mdm Chair, I will speak now on our approach to strengthen our food resilience and safeguard our hawker culture. As a country that imports over 90% of our food, Singapore will not be spared from global food supply disruptions. These can arise from disease outbreaks, climate change and geopolitical tensions. In safeguarding our food resilience, diversifying our import sources remains our core strategy. Today, we import from 187 countries, up from just 140 around two decades back. When accrediting food imports, SFA takes a risk-based approach. While products with low food safety risks do not require accreditation, SFA accredits higher-risk food products, like meat and egg products, in line with international practice. Since December 2024, SFA has streamlined this process, in line with the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, by accrediting at a broader food category level instead of by food products. This expands our import product range and improves business efficiency. But our food resilience cannot and does not hinge on one single strategy; it requires a multi-pronged approach. One complementary strategy is to maintain adequate food stocks to tide over supply disruptions, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, stockpiling alone is insufficient. For perishable essentials like fibre, long-term storage is challenging, involving inventory and logistics costs. This is why we develop some capacity and capability for local production. It complements our diversification strategy and stockpiling strategy with a regenerative characteristic, allowing us to continue producing food during supply disruptions. Ms Nadia Samdin asked about the progress of our \"30-by-30\" vision. Today, less than 10% of the food we consume is produced locally. When we conceived this vision in 2019, it was aspirational. The agri-food business climate then was more benign, with stronger investor interest, lower interest rates and lower energy prices. Now, the global food industry outlook has become less favourable, with dwindling investments in urban agri-food technology and alternative proteins and geopolitical tensions exacerbating uncertainties around energy costs. Local farms will continue to face inherent structural challenges, in this early stage when their production facilities have yet to achieve sufficient scale. A key challenge is high production costs in Singapore, given limited land and a tight labour force. This is exacerbated by strong price competition from imported produce, which enjoy lower production costs. For our farms to scale, we need to help them improve productivity and lower costs, while increasing consumer demand for local produce. Navigating these complex issues will require time, effort and close partnership across the Government, our industry and consumers. Despite these challenges, our capacity and capability to produce food locally has grown, and some food types have shown early successes. Locally-produced hen eggs and beansprouts now contribute 30% and 50% of our local consumption respectively. SFA is continuously assessing our progress and our initiatives' relevance in growing our local agri-food sector, gaining experience along the way. Ms Nadia Samdin asked whether we are reviewing Singapore's 30-by-30 goal. Indeed, we are reviewing our local production strategy to be more focused and targeted in addressing key challenges of productivity, costs and demand, and in fostering the sector's continued growth. We will share more details after our review. Ms Nadia Samdin asked about the initiatives announced in the Singapore Aquaculture Plan, which we refreshed last year, bringing stakeholders together to chart a shared roadmap to uplift our aquaculture sector. Under the plan, we are spearheading efforts to strengthen the supply resilience of agri-inputs, which are vital for our farms. In aquaculture, agri-inputs constitute up to 60% of the farms' production costs. Quality eggs and fingerlings form a key priority. However, with the inconsistent quality our farmers use today, fish mortalities can go up to 80%, impacting the downstream yield. The newly-established National Broodstock Centre (NBC) and Hatchery Development and Recognition Programme will supply to our farms genetically superior eggs and fingerlings, with higher survival and grow-out rates. SFA will work with local hatcheries to uplift their capabilities and gain accreditation under the programme, which allows them to access superior fish eggs from the NBC. The programme will first focus on Asian seabass, commonly produced and consumed by Singaporeans. SFA is in the process of training and accrediting a few seabass hatcheries. SFA's work is also underway to study potential sites for the hybrid sea farming model, in close consultation with Government agencies, the industry, researchers and nature groups. Identifying and allocating appropriate sites is not easy. It demands significant time and resources, given our limited sea space, competing uses and needing to mitigate environmental impact. Broadly, we will continue to avail space for farming by launching land and sea tenders progressively. SFA will announce tender details along the way. To Ms Nadia Samdin's question on keeping our marine environment clean, let me explain that all farms are required by licence to maintain clean and sanitary conditions. With the Farm Management Plan, introduced under the Food Safety and Security Act passed in Parliament this January, we also require licensees undertaking primary production activities to adopt means to mitigate food safety risks, disease spread and ensure sustainable production. To support our farms to be more productive and climate-resilient, SFA provides funding through the Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund. To address Mr Shawn Huang and Mr Dennis Tan's questions, the ACT Fund supports farms to adopt farming solutions for diverse needs, from small-scale trials to larger commercial systems, with over $28 million awarded to 43 companies by the end of 2024. Each application proposal is assessed holistically, considering its merits and ability to contribute to our food resilience. One example is Blue Ocean Aquaculture Technology. Supported by the earlier iteration of the ACT Fund, they developed an indoor recirculating aquaculture system to farm various fish species in higher densities, with a lower footprint and regardless of climate or external environmental changes. Another example, Yili Farm, has also benefitted from funding to construct an intensive soil and hydroponics farming system, achieving resource efficiencies. Mr Dennis Tan raised some suggestions on adopting permaculture principles and deploying natural solutions like aquatic plants, to improve climate resilience. Permaculture, in particular, tends to require extensive land space, which might not be as well-suited for local production in Singapore. Nonetheless, farms should assess the farming methods and solutions most appropriate for their operating model and constraints, accounting for the need to be commercially viable, climate-resilient and resource-efficient. Generally, SFA provides technical resources on agriculture technologies, and have account managers who can further assist and advise farmers on growth areas and development plans. To better address our farmers' diverse and emerging needs, SFA has enhanced the ACT Fund, incorporating their feedback. The enhancements will provide farms with more comprehensive coverage, to include expenses, such as marketing and branding; and expanded funding scope to cover standalone pre- and post-harvest production facilities. To provide farms more time to harness technology and innovation, SFA will also extend the maximum project funding duration from 27 to 36 months. As Miss Rachel Ong highlighted, local businesses seeking to innovate may need grants and other support, beyond research grants. Agri-food businesses can also access Enterprise Singapore's initiatives, like the Enterprise Development Grant and Startup SG, which finance innovation projects and capabilities. For our farms to achieve scale, they also need sustained demand. This is where strong support from the industry and consumers can help strengthen our Singapore Food Story. Under our Alliance for Action to encourage increased offtake for local produce, the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprise Federation (SAFEF) is expanding its work as a supply and demand aggregator. In May 2024, SAFEF launched the \"SG Farmers' Market\" and \"The Straits Fish\" product lines in selected FairPrice outlets, aggregating locally-farmed vegetables and marine tilapia respectively to make them more accessible to consumers, especially those in the heartlands. By last month, sales have increased about five-fold for local xiao bai cai and two-fold for processed local fish products. I am very heartened by the public response. SAFEF is now working with our farmers and industry partners to launch even more products. Beyond FairPrice outlets, consumers can also find \"SG Farmers' Market” vegetables at Sheng Siong supermarkets starting this month. More food businesses are recognised under the Farm-to-Table Recognition Programme, for their commitment to procure locally-produced, locally-farmed ingredients. Since launching in 2023, membership has grown steadily to 101 establishments by January this year. SFA will continue to encourage more businesses to come onboard this programme. Sir, let me now shift gears to another food-related topic. With SG60, we also mark the fifth year of the inscription of Singapore's hawker culture onto the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Our hawker centres form the heart of our hawker culture. Minister Grace Fu explained why we must look ahead to update our hawker centre landscape. This builds on our progress thus far. In the 2010s, we restarted building 20 new hawker centres after a hiatus to address Singaporeans' needs in estates underserved by food and beverage options. Today, 14 are in operation. I am also pleased to announce that two new hawker centres are opening in the first half of this year. Bukit Batok West Hawker Centre will feature 22 cooked food stalls and over 400 seats, while Punggol Coast Hawker Centre will introduce 40 stalls and over 680 seats. Both are designed for a pleasant dining environment, featuring high ceilings with improved ventilation, spacious seating areas and connectivity to surrounding facilities. As we progressively complete the remaining centres in the upcoming years, we are also looking beyond that. We plan to build another five new hawker centres to ensure more residents in underserved estates can access affordable and delicious hawker food. NEA will announce more details when ready. Besides building new hawker centres, we have invested in upgrading our existing infrastructure in addition to cyclical renovation works. We last embarked on a nationwide Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme (HUP), over 20 years ago to upgrade and rebuild almost 100 centres. More recently, we piloted the Hawker Centres Transformation Programme at two centres in Cheng San and Geylang Serai to improve hygiene conditions and address persistent infrastructural concerns. I am glad that Ms Nadia Samdin found it helpful, through works like improving seating layout to minimise crowding and enhancing ventilation with new fittings. The experiences we gained will inform our next bound, under HUP 2.0. As outlined by Minister Grace Fu, HUP 2.0 seeks to meet Singaporeans' evolving needs by upgrading older hawker centres or rebuilding, for some, into more vibrant, accessible and climate-resilient spaces. Upgrading and building hawker centres are extensive endeavours that we are planning ahead and implementing progressively for the next 20 to 30 years. To Ms Hany Soh's question, NEA is working closely with other agencies to dovetail with estate development plans and ensure local communities' needs are well-served. We will carefully examine our options and share more details when ready. Mr Pritam Singh asked about the future of markets. Of the over 7,000 such stalls in 83 markets managed under NEA, occupancy rates remained relatively stable at around 96% in recent years. Nonetheless, consumer patterns have shifted with changing demographics and availability of alternatives, like supermarkets and online retailers. NEA will assess local community needs and the availability of market produce, to determine the development plans of wet markets under HUP 2.0. Beyond the physical space, our hawker centres are also where our hawkers who, as masters of their craft, are the heart and soul of our hawker culture. In commemoration of SG60 and to appreciate our hawkers, the Minister for Finance has announced a one-time rental support of $600 this year, for each stall in hawker centres and markets managed by the Government and Government-appointed operators. As a nation, we share a joint responsibility to ensure that our hawker culture continues to thrive. The Government will lead by setting policies to support and sustain the hawker trade. This includes providing a conducive business environment, ensuring the trade remains attractive and nurturing a new generation of hawkers. To Mr Eric Chua and Ms Nadia Samdin's questions, indeed, as circumstances change, we need to review and adjust our policies. For instance, we saw the need to discourage excessively high tender bids for NEA-managed hawker centre stalls. Hence, we recently extended the duration for decreasing monthly stall rent from the bid price to the assessed market rate after the initial tenancy period by one more tenancy term. As we monitor outcomes, we are concurrently taking steps to encourage more informed and realistic bidding. To guide tenderers, NEA now shares the median assessed market rent for centres with vacant stalls, in NEA's tender exercises since last month. NEA will also launch an online self-help tool, which can help tenderers understand the costs involved in running a hawker stall. We also recognise hawkers' challenges in hiring stall assistants. Since January this year, we relaxed our manpower policy for hawker centres managed by NEA and NEA-appointed operators and are monitoring the impact. Enhancing productivity is another sustainable approach to manage manpower constraints and where we can leverage on technology as Mr Eric Chua suggests. For example, centralised dishwashing and cleaning process automation like tray conveyance systems can improve centre-wide productivity and are supported under NEA's Productive Hawker Centres programme. Also, under NEA's Hawkers’ Productivity Grant, we have disbursed over $3.4 million by end-2024 to co-fund hawkers in adopting stall-level automation equipment and digital solutions, like e-ordering and kitchen management systems. We will continue identifying and supporting practical technologies that can alleviate hawkers' challenges. Mr Eric Chua also suggested the two-shift system to optimise stall utilities. Hawkers can already do this today through NEA's Joint Operator Scheme, which allows eligible stallholders and their appointed joint operators to share stall operating hours without overlapping. While I am glad that some hawkers have benefited from this scheme, we acknowledge that such a scheme may be operationally difficult to accommodate for other hawkers, depending on their business models, as the Member has highlighted in his speech. We will continue to assess our policies to assist our hawkers and ensure alignment with operating realities. We also support aspiring hawkers to boost their chances of success. NEA does this through the Incubation Stall Programme, Hawkers’ Development Programme, and Hawkers Succession Scheme. Ms Nadia Samdin will be glad that by end-2024, over 100 aspiring hawkers have moved on to complete apprenticeships under hawker mentors. NEA has also allocated nearly 100 pre-fitted incubation stalls with reduced rent, to help aspiring hawkers kickstart their businesses. Our hawker landscape will continue evolving with the times. We will continue to review our policies and support programmes to ensure they can meet the interests of Singaporeans, our hawkers and other stakeholders, amid changing needs and expectations. Mr Chairman, food will remain central to Singapore’s resilience and our daily lives. As we forge ahead, we will continue adapting our strategies and uncovering new opportunities to ensure our food systems remain secure and our hawker culture continues to thrive. These will entail a collective effort from the Government, our industry partners and every Singaporean. Together, we can ensure a vibrant and resilient future for many generations to come. The Chairman: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey. The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Mr Baey Yam Keng): Mr Chairman, \"Our Sustainability, Our Resilience, Our Everyday\" represents MSE’s unwavering commitment to a clean, green and resilient Singapore. Over the last six decades, we have made significant progress in ensuring high levels of public health as our way of life. To reinforce good hygiene practices for collective well-being, MSE designated 2024 as the Year of Public Hygiene. I will update on our efforts in addressing persistent challenges, such as littering hotspots, rat infestations and public toilet cleanliness. Our community is generally civic-minded, but littering remains a concern due to the inconsiderate actions of some people. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about NEA’s efforts in improving cleanliness at littering hotspots. In 2024, NEA increased littering enforcement, conducting about 130 blitzes, a six-fold increase from 2023. NEA’s camera surveillance capabilities were also strengthened, allowing up to 1,000 CCTV deployments a year, compared to 250 in 2023. Last year, CCTVs were deployed 300 times at 13 identified littering hotspots, enhancing operational effectiveness leading to a 36% reduction in litter count between May and December 2024. Thanks to the collective efforts by premises owners, cleaners and members of the public, Causeway Point, Chinatown Complex, Jurong Point and Vista Point are on track to be exited from the list of littering hotspots. NEA will continue to tackle the remaining hotspots through appropriate interventions, including public education and enforcement. On high-rise littering, we share Ms Hany Soh’s concern. High-rise littering is a serious offence, as it poses a danger to the public and dirties the environment. To address it, NEA has leveraged camera surveillance and the presumption clause in the Environmental Public Health Act. Other technologies are used as well. Ms Hany Soh and Ms Nadia Samdin will be glad to hear that data analytics have allowed NEA to prioritise camera deployments and shorten the investigation process, leading to more timely enforcement actions. In the coming months, NEA will also extend camera surveillance duration from the current 14 days, to up to 28 days, to improve the chances of capturing high-rise littering incidents. Reducing the incidence of vector-borne diseases remains a priority. Ms Hany Soh and Mr Eric Chua asked about MSE’s pest control efforts. In 2024, NEA worked with stakeholders on upstream measures to improve their housekeeping and refuse management. This is to deny rats access to habitats and food sources, especially food waste. In addition, NEA also provided training and practical resources, such as guidelines and cleaning and maintenance sample contract specifications, to help stakeholders manage rat-related issues holistically. Ms Nadia Samdin may be interested to hear that NEA also uses technology to enhance rat surveillance for more targeted interventions. One example is the implementation of thermal imaging technology which complements existing ones, such as infrared cameras, with clearer data on potential food sources for rats, their congregation areas and the pathways. As rats multiply quickly, keeping their population low requires sustained efforts from everyone. To this end, NEA shares surveillance data with stakeholders, such as Town Councils and premises owners, so that they can implement measures to prevent rat infestations, including denying the access to habitats and food sources. Enforcement will continue to play a key role. In 2024, intensified enforcements by NEA and SFA saw more than 1,000 enforcement actions, almost twice the number in 2023, taken against premises owners or occupiers for rat-related lapses. From 1 April 2025, NEA will tighten its enforcement regime, including for poor refuse management and housekeeping. Shifting to mosquito control, community vigilance and innovations like Project Wolbachia have helped us avoid major dengue surges in 2023 and 2024. Going forward, we will scale up Project Wolbachia. The expansion to Jurong East since February and Jurong West in April this year will increase Project Wolbachia’s coverage to 580,000 households. By the end of 2026, 800,000 households, or about 50% of all Singaporean households, will benefit from Project Wolbachia. I assure Mr Gan Thiam Poh that we will announce details on future expansion when ready. NEA will also be conducting pilots to understand the technology’s ability to disrupt dengue clusters. To address Mr Eric Chua's residents’ concerns on Wolbachia-Aedes releases, NEA will respond promptly to feedback to assure residents on the temporary nature of the increased mosquito presence. Over time, with the community’s support, we can maintain low mosquito population, which will lead to fewer releases. Even as we leverage technology, stakeholders and residents must continue to take action to prevent mosquito breeding. Community vigilance is needed to keep dengue at bay. Several Members have asked about public toilet cleanliness and the Public Toilets Taskforce’s recommendations. The Taskforce focused on public toilets that consistently fare poorly in cleanliness surveys, including that conducted by Singapore Management University students. After almost a year of engagement and discussions, the Taskforce, which I co-chaired with Mr Andrew Khng, the Chairman of Public Hygiene Council, submitted our recommendations to Minister Grace Fu recently. The Minister has shared that MSE endorses the Taskforce’s recommendations, namely, to \"Build Well, Clean Well, and Use Well\". Let me elaborate on MSE’s response. First, to achieve cleaner public toilets, good toilet design is important as it facilitates easy maintenance. To this end, we welcome the Taskforce’s list of recommended toilet design features. Deep cleaning and providing better training support for cleaners are also critical to improve toilet cleanliness. The Taskforce also recommended grants to support coffee shop operators in toilet upgrading or deep cleaning. Mr Chairman, coffee shops are privately-operated commercial premises. However, they keep their toilets accessible to patrons and non-patrons, providing a public service to the community. This is particularly important in an ageing population, as seniors may have more difficulties in managing bladder and bowel control. Instead of building public toilets in the community, the Government could tap on the Singapore culture of coffee shops being natural gathering points for residents. I am happy to announce that MSE will set aside $5 million each for a Coffeeshop Toilet Renovation Grant and a Coffeeshop Toilet Deep Cleaning Grant. Coffee shop operators can apply to NEA for funding of up to 95% of their toilet renovation costs, capped at $50,000 per coffee shop. They can also apply for up to 95% funding of their two-year deep cleaning contract cost, capped at $25,000 per coffee shop. More information will be provided to coffee shops to help them understand the recommended design features, the adoption of which is a criterion for the renovation grant. Successful grant applicants will also receive complimentary onsite training for their in-house cleaners to improve their cleaning effectiveness and efficiency. However, grants alone are not enough. Toilet users and community volunteers can also contribute to cleaner toilets. To cultivate shared responsibility for public toilet cleanliness, we endorse the Taskforce’s recommendation to refresh the Happy Toilet Programme by the Restroom Association Singapore and expand the Neighbourhood Toilets Community Group programme by the Public Hygiene Council. Leveraging technology, such as feedback systems, can facilitate timely feedback, and contribute to public toilet cleanliness. With the Taskforce’s support, the ReportLah! solution is now trialled at over 10 coffee shops in Singapore. Furthermore, we will continue to enforce against errant operators, including suspensions where necessary. In 2024, NEA and SFA stepped up inspections on public toilet cleanliness. Close to 19,000 inspections were carried out, with about 1,300 enforcement actions taken against premises owners and managers. I am heartened that premises have taken action to rectify lapses and encourage them to sustain their efforts to ensure cleaner toilets for all. Over time, we hope that these measures will break the cycle of dirty coffee shop toilets, so that we all can enjoy better and cleaner toilets. Mr Chairman, I will now say a few words in Mandarin. (In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Gathering and chatting with neighbours at coffee shops is part of our Singapore culture. Anyone, even if not a customer of the coffee shop, can still use the toilets there. This is a public service that coffee shop operators provide to the community, and it is especially important in an ageing society. Therefore, the Government will provide grants to coffee shop operators to encourage them to adopt good toilet designs and conduct regular deep cleaning of toilets, enabling the public to access better and cleaner toilets. MSE will allocate $10 million to launch the Coffee Shop Toilet Renovation Grant and Coffee Shop Toilet Deep Cleaning Grant. Cleaners from successful applicants will also receive free on-site cleaning training to help improve toilet cleanliness. NEA will provide more details about the grants. Improving public toilet hygiene requires continuous effort from both toilet operators and users. Clean toilets benefit everyone. (In English): Finally, Mr Louis Ng asked about legislating a smoking ban at windows and balconies. Expanding smoking restrictions to cover private homes and spaces must be carefully considered as this infringes the privacy of people in their own homes. Even with legislation, we need enforcement for restrictions to be effective. The challenge is that current technologies do not allow the detection of smoking activities at home without infringing privacy. However, I urge smokers to exercise social responsibility to minimise the impact that smoking has on the well-being of others, including their neighbours. I know that some smokers choose to smoke at windows and balconies so that their family members are not exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke. As the Chinese saying goes, \"己所不欲勿施于人\", which means \"extending to others the courtesy you would like in return\", I urge smokers to exercise the same consideration to their neighbours. Close your door and windows if you do smoke at home. Otherwise, go downstairs and smoke away from your block in a non-smoking prohibited area, such as open spaces and unsheltered carparks. We can work together as a community to engender a more gracious society as we shape social norms on acceptable smoking behaviour. MSE and NEA will work together with stakeholders to develop ground-up solutions and promote socially responsible behaviour. Mr Chairman, the Year of Public Hygiene has empowered the community and stakeholders to explore new ways to achieve better public health outcomes. To consolidate these gains, NEA will introduce a new concept of operations. Called \"Cleaner Neighbourhood\", this aims to strengthen community involvement. NEA will adopt an integrated operations and outreach approach to tackle hotspots with cleanliness, refuse management and congregation problems. NEA will also seek to address the issues upstream, with broader community involvement and greater use of technology. This will include upskilling NEA officers to be more effective at managing multifaceted public hygiene issues. NEA will embrace greater use of video analytics and AI to enhance surveillance and enforcement capabilities, with data used to identify hotspots that require greater intervention. Surveillance data will also be shared with stakeholders, such as Town Councils, trade premises and dormitory operators, to better support their preventive and corrective measures. Finally, NEA will strengthen community ownership by collaborating with community leaders and partners to reinforce and sustain proactive citizenry without over-reliance on enforcement. A new initiative, called the Community Action for Cleanliness, will complement operations at identified hotspots with engagement of local stakeholders to address community pain points more holistically and effectively. To Ms Poh Li San and Ms Nadia Samdin's queries, technology is also being leveraged in other parts of the MSE Family to improve productivity and deliver better public services. Since February 2024, PUB has implemented an AI-enabled video analytics solution to inspect drainage inlets along 7,000 kilometres of roadside drains. The technology provides for speedier and more accurate detection of defects, allowing PUB to respond in a timelier manner. In 2022, SFA introduced a mobile lab for onsite testing during food safety incidents. This allows SFA to quickly identify potential food safety risks onsite at large-scale events. SFA is now developing a second-generation mobile lab that can handle substantially higher testing volume with faster results. Mr Chairman, we received strong support from the community in the Year of Public Hygiene. Over 1,700 activities were co-organised by NEA and community partners to promote good cleanliness and hygiene practices. Many partners will continue these initiatives in 2025 and beyond. For example, the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC), ran a campaign titled \"Clean Districts, Amazing Communities\" in partnership with NEA, seven Town Councils, and susGain. Over 120 litter-picking activities and 620 zero-waste activities were completed by the various CDAC centres islandwide from June to September 2024. Post-campaign, CDAC continued its partnership with NEA to promote a sustainable lifestyle among its beneficiaries and volunteers. Assoc Prof Razwana Begum asked about community engagement and action. This year, as we celebrate SG60, we will provide more opportunities for everyone to co-create a sustainable Singapore together. Since the launch of the SG Eco Fund in 2020, more than $13 million in funding has empowered over 300 individuals, groups and organisations to initiate projects that involve the community to advance environmental sustainability. To catalyse more community-led projects, we have raised the maximum grant for the SG Eco Fund's Sprout category, which is the entry tier, from $8,000 to $30,000 for all successful applications received this year. I encourage interested parties to step forward in the spirit of SG60 and the SG Eco Fund, to play your special part and make a difference together. Connecting like-minded partners, including our youths, strengthen our collective ability to tackle sustainability and climate change issues. Last year, I talked about how the #GreenHacks Youth Panel lets interested youths contribute to policymaking and other green efforts. The Panel has since submitted its recommendations to address low domestic recycling rates. This year, we will forge on with the Climate Youth Development Programme. Over the last two years, we have equipped 80 youths with relevant knowledge so that they can contribute purposefully towards sustainability and climate change issues. Some of them have since amplified their learnings to other stakeholders and started ground-up projects to encourage community action. We are inspired by our youths' dedication to a cleaner, greener Singapore. Through our initiatives, we will partner and enable them to be effective pathfinders of our present and their future. Fellow Singaporeans can play a part as well. Join our Coastal Conversations to shape the future of our coastal areas, participate in the annual Go Green SG from 16 May to 29 June 2025 and practise green habits to support our sustainable cooling movement. There is a lot more that we can do together. In conclusion, Mr Chairman, a clean, green and resilient Singapore is not by chance. MSE will continue to partner all segments of society to make a difference. Together, we can achieve sustainability, resilience and a better everyday life for all. The Chairman: Clarifications for the Ministers? Mr Louis Ng. Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Sir, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for answering my cut on second-hand smoke. And I am sure he expects me to clarify further. But I think the Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that there is no current technology to catch someone smoking at home and, so, because of that we cannot legislate a ban. But we do have a law making it illegal to be naked at home if it is in public view, and we can enforce that. So, why can NEA or MSE not then enforce this ban on smoking in your home? Second, I think many of us receive complaints from our residents about second-hand smoke. Many of us do. So, NEA will issue advisories urging that resident to not smoke at the windows and balconies. That often fails. We urge them to try CMC. That often fails, and we try CDRT, and that fails because they cannot gather the evidence. Many times, the case is thrown out. So, if this resident goes through the entire journey and it does not work, can I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary what help can NEA offer to these residents who are really suffering from second-hand smoke? Mr Baey Yam Keng: Mr Chairman, I can always count on Mr Chua to continue his crusade. Oh, Mr Ng. Sorry, sorry. Yes, I got smoked already. [Laughter.] Well, indeed. Smoking, as I said, our current surveillance technology does not allow us to do that. So, if we have a law, the public or complainants will expect the Government to take action, and we do not have credible, efficient technologies that we are able to do that. So, we will disappoint the public. In fact, Mr Louis Ng will also disappoint his residents because we are not able to take enforcement action. I do not like to compare smoking with going around naked at home. I suppose, for streakers at home, probably it is their neighbours who may complain or will try to take pictures and get the authorities to take action. I think it is not entirely apple-for-apple kind of comparison. But I assure Mr Ng and all those concerned about smoking at home causing disamenity, which I also receive similar feedback from my residents, that we recognise the disamenity. And as soon as we are able to find a way with the right technology to be able to do surveillance and detect smoking at private spaces, at windows and balconies, we will do something. The Chairman: Mr Gerald Giam. Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song: I thank Senior Minister of State Amy Khor for responding to my cut. Would the Ministry consider encouraging or requiring all F&B outlets to provide plain drinking water at free or low cost to customers, instead of charging $2 or more for bottled water, which often comes in a plastic single-use bottle? This will promote healthier beverage choices by making plain water more accessible and reduce consumption of sugary drinks. Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan: I must say that I am glad that Mr Louis Ng has got a fresh perspective from my colleague. But with regard to Mr Gerald Giam's question, as I have said, tap water is safe for drinking in Singapore. I think PUB has reiterated many times and we do have lots of water dispenser, water points, water cooler at the hawker centres, at regional parks, at the bus terminals and interchanges. In fact, BCA's Green Mark scheme actually awards points to developers or building owners who provide water coolers or water points within their premises, within their building, whether it is in a common area near the toilets and so on. And even BCA, the Health Promotion Board had a Green Mark for healthier workplaces, also awards points to office premises which put water points within the offices. So, drinking water is very accessible. You just need to bring your reusable, which we have been promoting through our \"Say YES to Waste Less\" campaign, for many many years, and then you can actually fill up and get your water. With regard to the F&B outlets, we do not have any plans to go and require them to provide free drinking water, for instance, or at low cost. I think it is up to the F&B businesses to decide how to charge and so on. There is a lot of competition, so they will take that into account. The other thing is, actually, water is a valuable resource and even though water can be taken freely from the tap, it is not free, because the F&B owners have to pay for the water. And there is a cost to serving the water, the table water, as well as to wash the glasses and so on that it is served in. So, we will need to allow them to decide how they are going to provide the service to their customers and whether they will charge or not. But regardless, the reality is that water is easily accessible from various drinking points. The Chairman: Ms Hany Soh. Ms Hany Soh: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have three clarifications. The first is to the Minister in relation to her announcement of HUP 2.0. I understand that there is a long-term plan for existing hawker centres to be transformed. In this regard, can I enquire what are the factors which will be taken into consideration in prioritising which estates' hawker centres will be upgraded first? So, that is my first clarification. The second and third clarifications are to Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey. The first is in relation to high-rise littering issues. I understand from Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey that there are plans to place surveillance cameras for a longer period of time, up to 28 days. While I appreciate this effort, but based on our residents' feedback, more often than not, it is that surveillance cameras, while they serve a good purpose in enforcement, actually, the better benefits of them actually pertain to deterrence. So, I urge the Ministry to consider whether we can explore – rather than a specific duration of 28 days – whether we can have it on a permanent basis. It is just like speed cameras, for instance, in the hope that such issues will not recur after the specified period where the cameras have been removed. The third point is on the public toilets. It has been announced that MSE will set aside some grants for coffee shops' renovations and deep cleaning. In this regard, can we actually explore to extend this grant to other toilets that are used by the public as well, outside of coffee shops, for example, those that are at the neighbourhood centres, those that are at the Community Clubs that are actually used by the public as well. Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Chairman, with regard to the first question from Member Ms Hany Soh, there are many factors that will go into the consideration on prioritising the centre for HUP 2.0. But I would summarise it as follows. First, we will look at the centre, how important or how critical is the centre requiring major transformations. Second, we have to look at the needs of the residents in that area. Are they in need of a new centre? Is there a need for consideration or consolidation? Are there growing demographic demands? How is it changing with time? The third one is really to expand further and see whether what are the needs in the surrounding area as well. I think the fourth factor would be to really have a very engaged session with our land agencies, such as HDB, URA, to look at the overall master planning of the towns and of the land around these centres. Mr Baey Yam Keng: I thank Ms Hany Soh for her suggestions. She would be aware that for the surveillance cameras to catch high-rise littering, in fact, we have already increased the number of deployments and each of these requires the equipment, the set-up and the checking as well as the analysis of the footages. So, it does require resources. The reason why we are extending the deployment period is because these areas tend to be a problem of recalcitrant litterbugs. So, they are habitual litterbugs. We hope that with 28 days, four weeks, they will be caught, during this period. And when they are caught, they will be subject to penalties. If I am not wrong, they will be issued Court orders; you need to go to Court. So, the penalties and the punishment, we hope they will teach them a lesson, that they will change this habit forever. That is the objective of it. As we know, there are so many different HDB blocks in Singapore. It will not be possible to deploy such surveillance systems on a permanent basis. I seek the Member's understanding on this. As for the grants to extend beyond coffee shops, the reason why we are focusing on coffee shop toilets now is because, based on surveys over many years, coffee shop toilets have fared consistently at the lowest level of cleanliness. So, we want to tackle this. If we dilute our resources to cover other public toilets, then I think the impact will not be significant and it will not address the issue that we are facing at hand. So, I hope that we will have the support to roll this out and get the onboarding of coffee shop operators as well as the cooperation of users and other stakeholders so that we can have cleaner public toilets at coffee shops. The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng. Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Sir, allow me to take up the challenge from Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey that there is no technology available. I have shown this in Parliament before. But this is a photo from an NEA camera, showing someone smoking at their window and there is actually quite a number of photos. So, the technology does exist. The current cameras that we use to catch the litterbugs can catch someone smoking at the windows. So, there really is not an excuse to say that there is no technology. But there is and we can use that again to legislate and help to protect people from second-hand smoke. Mr Baey Yam Keng: Yes, for surveillance cameras to catch high-rise littering, the cameras are typically deployed at the ground level with the camera projected upwards, to try to catch the littering act. So, by counting the floors and which window, which level, the littering act is caught and we are able to take enforcement action. In those pictures that Mr Louis Ng has shown, those are in rare cases or exceptional places where we are not able to mount cameras on the ground, because by pointing a camera into the windows of a home for suspected littering offences, it really goes into the privacy of the house owner. We do not think it is something that our residents would appreciate because it could be a suspect household. It need not be a confirmed smoker causing the nuisance to neighbours. So, it is about this privacy invasion that we are not sure that we should roll it out as a way to catch smoking at windows and balconies. I do seek the Member's understanding. Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap: Sir, earlier in my speech, I have sought two clarifications on my cuts pertaining to ventilation systems for bakeries in order to better manage the disamenities caused by bakeries located in the HDB blocks. I really have not received a reply on this from the Ministry. Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Chairman, I would like to maybe ask the Member to give me the background, because I think he is referring to a very specific case which I am afraid I am not very familiar with. It is a specific case of a bakery with a ventilation problem that affects the neighbours. Perhaps, the Member can describe the problem to me again, please, Sir, through you. Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap: Sir, actually, I have written to SFA and they have actually replied to me recently. I just want to get a better clarification on the issues. What happened was that there is this issue that has been going on for about 10 years where the bakery located in the same block, a four-storey HDB block, has been emanating noise, heat and pungent smell. So, I have written to the relevant agencies, and the last round I wrote was to SFA. And then they did mention that they are working with other relevant agencies to look into the matter. But my question is basically whether SFA has received similar feedback on such issues and how pieces of feedback are being received in a year, and also whether there is any requirement for bakeries that operate in an HDB residential block in managing the noise and heat level resulting from their daily operation. Is there any kind of regulation or requirement imposed by SFA? Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Thank you very much for the clarification. I do not think that this is a very major problem on the ground. I do not hear many such feedback coming from Members. But I will have to confirm again. So, I will very much appreciate if the Member could file a Parliamentary Question (PQ), so that we can give a fuller reply. On the feedback about SFA imposing regulations on ventilation as well as on noise, I would very much consider the Member's suggestions of perhaps having more regulations to regulate the businesses. We will definitely take that into consideration. But I will come back with a fuller reply to the Member's PQ. The Chairman: With that, Mr Louis Ng, would you like to withdraw your amendment? Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang: Sir, I thank all Members who have spoken up passionately and fought hard to improve our policies. I especially thank Minister Grace Fu, Senior Minister of State Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng for all their positive responses, except on the issue of second-hand smoke. My persistence on this issue – I have always wanted to say it – is as lingering as second-hand smoke. That is a persistent problem for so many residents and I hope sooner rather than later, we will really fix this problem. I also want to again record my appreciation and thanks, on behalf of all of us, to the staff members at MSE, NEA, SFA and PUB for all their hard work and dedication towards very important causes here in Singapore. With that, Sir, I seek leave to withdraw my amendment. [(proc text) The sum of $2,658,974,300 for Head L ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates. (proc text)] [(proc text) The sum of $1,477,646,700 for Head L ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates. (proc text)] Clarification by the Minister of State for Law The Chairman: Minister of State Murali, you have a clarification to make? The Minister of State for Law (Mr Murali Pillai): Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to speak. Sir, at the Committee of Supply debate on the Ministry of Law, I stated in my speech that since the amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code was implemented in August 2024, more than 100 accused persons have been released on personal bond for non-bailable offences. Pursuant to a clarification sought by the hon Member Ms Sylvia Lim, I stated that my impression was that the 100 accused persons were released by the Court, but that I will check it. I have since checked it, Sir, and I would like to clarify that the number of more than 100 persons is actually for non-bailable offences investigated by the Police. It does not include the number of persons released on personal bond for non-bailable offences by the Courts. We do not have the precise number of persons who have been released on personal bond for non-bailable offences by law enforcement agencies or by the Courts. We have been working with the relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Singapore Police Force and the Courts, to track this number. As I mentioned in my speech, the personal bond amendment is still in its infancy, having been operational for just six months or so since August 2024. It is still too early to assess the full impact of this amendment, but we will monitor this. The Chairman: Your clarification is noted. Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development) The Chairman: Head T, Ministry of National Development. Miss Cheryl Chan. Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast): Chairman, I move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head T of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\" Sir, as we continue to strive to make Singapore a more inclusive and liveable city, it is crucial that our policies evolve to meet the new trends and needs of all Singaporeans through different generations. Today, I wish to highlight a few observations in housing options and offer suggestions for consideration. First, Housing and Development Board (HDB) Build-To-Order (BTO) flats for middle-income households and singles. The younger generation are now settling down much later and many begin to purchase their first home closer to or after the age of 30. Given the rise in median income and ability of our younger generation to secure better paying jobs, this meant that a dual-income household will easily surpass the current HDB total income ceiling of $14,000 around the age of 30. For these couples, they usually find that they are left out of a prized opportunity to purchase their first BTO flat from the Government which can form a part of their nest-egg for retirement. Some even do not qualify for the direct purchase of executive condominiums and have no choice but to purchase a resale flat or a private property. Depending on the age of the resale flat and its location, it results in some inherent restrictions to the buyer, for example, the loan amount available, inability to access HDB concessionary housing loan and others. Similarly, we are seeing a growing trend of more singles within our community. The same BTO challenge applies for singles purchasing flats under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme where its current income ceiling threshold is $7,000. In today's market and for those who are 35 years old and above, there are many whose income would exceed this threshold and be disqualified to purchase BTO flat, not to mention that some singles are still facing difficulties in being allocated a flat in the regular BTO or Sale of Balance Flats exercise. Further, despite having been given the option to purchase all flat types, there are singles who are still unable to buy BTO flat and have to settle for a resale flat. Many of them wish to be living near their parents or siblings to provide caregiving and support as they age. But these resale flats are typically in mature estates, and singles face the same issues as that of the middle-income couples. Based on a single income, it is even harder for singles to consider purchasing a private property. I would like to ask the Minister when the Ministry will re-evaluate the income thresholds and the eligibility criteria for HDB loan. Also, what viable options can be made available for these groups within the decade? While there are Singaporeans who aspire to progress from public into private housing, this is not a default choice for many young couples and singles who wish to have the option of living in public housing purchased from the Government. I acknowledge that the Government has continuously adjusted policies to cater for different population segments to ensure their basic housing needs are addressed. I hope more can be done for these specific groups so that they could also enjoy the benefits of our nation's progress and not be caught by the affordability gap to own a home within their means. Second, Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme for private property owners. I am very heartened to hear Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's announcement that the EASE programme will be extended to private property owners. I have made these requests before based on my residents' feedback. We are encouraging our seniors to age in place. Yet, ageing at home is not easy. Depending on the needs and mobility of the seniors, the cost of modifications can be prohibitive. At times, individual homeowners may not be able to secure contractors who are willing to take up what we call the \"small\" jobs. A home that is not equipped to support the seniors' needs can become a significant hindrance to their well-being. Small but essential modifications, such as grab bars, non-slip flooring and ramps, can greatly improve their quality of life. These would also help the caregivers. Can the Minister elaborate on what the EASE programme for private property entails and when it will commence. Will the programme begin with EASE 2.0 work scope and what would the subsidy support look like? By extending support to seniors in private property, we send a strong message that every senior matters; regardless of where they stay. Even if the scope of support is smaller than the public housing, providing some level of assistance to these seniors would ease their financial burden and improve their quality of life. Our population is ageing and we must take proactive steps to ensure our elderly citizens can live with dignity and comfort. Third, housing option for families with special needs children or adults. In 2024 Ministry of National Development's (MND's) Committee of Supply (COS), I spoke up for divorcees with special needs children and asked whether interim housing can be provided for these divorcees or those that are still in the process of finalising their divorce. I wish to raise this point again, but more on the perspective of long-term housing for any family with special needs children or adults. For these adults, I refer to those who are diagnosed with special needs or disabilities since young and are now in their adulthood. Personally, I have encountered families with such situations and some of whom are my residents. These families often struggle to find an HDB flat that meet their unique requirements. In some cases, they need to relocate due to the difficulties in the current or former neighbourhoods that they lived in. It is disheartening to hear of families facing hostility from neighbours who may not fully understand or be willing to accommodate the challenges of caring for special needs children or adults. Noise disturbance being a common issue for dispute. To cite another recent example of a resident living in private property with a remaining lease of less than 10 years. Given that he and his wife's age are both nearing eighties and they are caring for a handicapped son in his forties, they hope to downgrade to an HDB flat while they are still mobile. However, they have repeatedly failed in their appeal for waiver on the wait-out period of 15 months in order to purchase a 5-room flat. One is a retiree and the other a housewife, they do not have active income nor huge savings and will unlikely make much profit from the sale of their private property given its running out lease. The reason for them wanting a larger flat is solely because their son can only move around on a wheelchair and, with other medical conditions, he requires the space; especially, they have a live-in helper since the elderly couple cannot physically manage their son independently. Moving multiple times between flats is not ideal for them for the reasons stated. They are also worried whether they are able to find an affordable interim place to rent and whether the landlord is willing to accept them, given their son's condition. This couple's only hope is for the HDB flat to be a more permanent home for their son and is certainly not expecting to purchase it for windfall proceeds from a future sale. I fully appreciate there are many requests and families with varying conditions in Singapore. However, families with special needs adults form a very small proportion of all our housing needs. I hope the Ministry can introduce special exemptions that would allow these families greater flexibility in choosing a suitable flat, whether they are purchasing a new home or downgrading to a more manageable space. Another area for the Ministry to consider is how to cater for those living in Adult Disability Housing as the current enrolment age is between 18 and 55 years old. Should some families be unable to care for them at a later age and begin to look for housing option when their charges are past 55 years old, how can they be cared for as these special needs adults are incapable of self-care? Caring for one with special needs requires extensive resources, patience and a conducive environment. Unfortunately, when these families faced unkindness or intolerance from neighbours, it places even more stress on the caregiver. Some families are compelled to move multiple times in search of a more understanding community. I believe the Ministry can play a role in alleviating these struggles by ensuring that such families have options in securing homes where they feel safe and supported. Sir, beyond housing policy, we should also work towards fostering a more compassionate society through public education and outreach programmes. Apart from individual housing needs, we must, over time, address the topic of social cohesion between private and public housing. Forward Singapore is fundamentally about community building and we should ensure that our urban planning reflects this vision by fostering greater neighbourliness and mutual understanding. Shared facilities are just one means towards this, but the interaction of people from diverse backgrounds and housing types are more critical in enhancing community bonding. The need for social cohesion is even more pressing in today's society, where income disparity, housing segregation and other factors can inadvertently lead to division. We should not allow a housing type to define social circles or create barriers. By designing common spaces that are welcoming to all, we can cultivate a shared identity and strengthen our social fabric. Let us work together to ensure that our housing policies and urban planning align with the evolving needs of our citizens. Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): HDB resale flat buyers are offered more grants than buyers of BTO flats, as BTOs are already subsidised by the HDB, whereas resale flats are priced at the market rate. As Singaporeans know, resale flat prices can be very high. Even flats with 60 years left on their lease can cost well in excess of half a million dollars. A significant number of resale flats are purchased by first-time married couples who must devote a significant chunk of their Central Provident Fund (CPF) retirement funds on servicing mortgage payments. By the time retirement comes along, they may have to downgrade to unlock the equity in their HDB flat, equity which is likely to have depleted significantly because of the reality of the 99-year lease decay countdown. With the days of iron rice bowls, lifetime job security and pensions no longer the norm for Singaporeans, retirement adequacy for the current and later generations is a more significant issue today. Another reality is that current generations of Singaporeans will not ride the same property escalator as their parents did, from which many ascended from public housing to private homes and, in some cases, to buying a landed property within a single lifetime. More pertinently, when compared to their peers who purchase a new BTO flat to live in, those who buy an older resale flat, say, with 60 years left on the lease, all other things being equal, will have less money to buy a smaller flat when they retire and, by extension, will have less for their CPF life payouts as well. The policy of increasing CPF grants for resale flat buyers was last revisited in August last year and it seeks to make HDB resale flats more affordable for resale flat buyers. But this policy can have the perverse effect of sellers raising prices even more and new buyers chasing ever-increasing resale prices. We need to see how we can strengthen the retirement adequacy of resale flat buyers who buy flats with a significant chunk of their leases already expended. A renewed focus on building the retirement incomes of first-time resale flat buyers would ensure that resale flat buyers consider their resale flat purchases carefully, with an eye on the 99-year lease countdown clock and their retirement planning considerations in mind. For resale flat buyers who qualify for resale flat grants, would the Government consider giving resale flat buyers the option of putting aside a portion of the CPF resale grant, to top up their CPF Special Accounts, instead of allowing the entire grant to be deployed for the resale flat purchase? To illustrate, a first-time couple aged 35 years of age, deploys $25,000 of the grant directly into their CPF accounts and assuming each party tops up just $200 a month to their accounts from the ages of 35 to 55, at a 4% interest in the Special Account, each of them would see this grant compound to slightly more than $125,000 by the time they reach 55 years of age. The HDB Home Ownership Scheme, which allowed the use of CPF money in 1968 and the sale of HDB flats on the resale market in 1971, have become an increasingly significant factor when it comes to retirement adequacy. The objective of home ownership in and of itself is not the problem. However, with the 99-year lease decay looming over Singaporeans and far more foreseeable than it was from the vantage point of 1968 and 1971, the fundamental objective of CPF for retirement needs must come back into focus. For the immediate term and given how complex HDB housing policy has become, any changes and alternatives with respect to HDB policy will have to be explored at the margins. To this end, I would suggest there could be some policy space to better protect first-time buyers of older resale HDB properties from the reality of the 99-year lease decay countdown clock. The Chairman: Mr Xie Yao Quan, you can take your two cuts together. Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong): Thank you, Chairman. In the face of disruptions brought on by COVID-19, the Government has made what I would describe as a breathtaking range of moves on housing in the last few years and achieved a very strong report card. Yet, in my view, there is one major issue that still needs intervention and that is our HDB resale market – which has risen sharply in the last few years and continues to rise. Now I know supply-side measures by the Government will need more time to work themselves into the HDB resale market and, eventually, the market will stabilise. But there is also something to be said about the fairness to whole cohorts of home buyers, especially first timers, when they are caught in a prolonged upturn in the HDB resale market cycle and are either priced out completely from the resale market or are pressured into a buying decision in order to lock-in a price, despite a preference to look around a bit more in the market. And the more time it takes for measures to cool the resale market, the greater the number of cohorts affected as such. I wonder if this is fair, especially for first-timers. I hope the Government can develop more policy options on the demand side, to cool the HDB resale market more quickly, when needed. Specifically, I suggest we have a separate buyer stamp duty framework for HDB flats. The public housing market has always been regulated separately, with its own rules and design to achieve key social goals. So, it stands to reason that the HDB market should have its own buyer stamp duty framework that is decoupled from the quanta and dynamics of private property transactions. This separate buyer stamp duty framework for the HDB market can give the Government greater policy optionality when it needs to quickly cool the resale market, to preserve fairness for all cohorts of home buyers. Chairman, in recent years, the Government has enhanced the Public Rental Scheme by introducing new typologies to provide more housing options for lower-income households, such as the Single Room Shared Facilities pilot. Could MND provide an update on the pilot, and how the Government is continuing to improve the Public Rental Scheme to better support the evolving needs of our vulnerable groups? The Chairman: Mr Henry Kwek, you can take your two cuts together. Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru): Chairman, to meet the growing demand for homes, driven by smaller family size and evolving housing needs, MND has significantly ramped up the supply of BTOs and private homes. These efforts are paying off, with supply and demand now stabilizing at pre-COVID-19 levels, giving home buyers more options. At the same time, strong income growth since the pandemic has shifted housing needs and many young couples are taking longer to settle down, whether due to career priorities, financial planning or lifestyle choices. However, some aspiring homeowners, particularly Singaporeans who do well in their career but lack familial support for down payments for private property, face challenges in securing affordable housing. With this in mind, would MND consider raising the income ceiling for BTOs and executive condominiums (ECs), as well as increasing the supply of ECs? That would provide more housing options for the upper middle-income segments, ensuring that Singapore remains a place where home ownership is accessible, aspirations are met and the ladder of social mobility remains strong for future generations. The cost of living, especially the price of cooked food, remain one of the top concerns for Singaporeans. Rising food prices driven by inflation and global supply disruptions have placed pressure on households, especially lower-income families and seniors. Affordability of cooked food is therefore paramount. At the same time, it is also important to allow food businesses the flexibility to adapt, innovate and to cater to diverse consumer preference. Therefore, the budget meal initiative strikes this balance, offering lower-cost meal options for price-sensitive consumers, on the one hand, while ensuring that hawkers and eateries are not restricted in their offerings. This approach also helps to maintain a vibrant food culture while supporting those who need it the most. Since the launch of the budget meal initiative, can MND share what has been the take-up rate so far, and what more can we do to further expand affordable food options in our neighbourhood? Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Chairman, the Ministry and HDB announced the Budget Meal initiative in March 2023 to provide Singaporeans with more affordable food options. HDB had set the target to have all coffee shops leased from HDB to offer budget meals by 2026. Under this initiative, all HDB coffee shops that are renewing their tenancies from May 2023 will be required to offer at least four budget meals and two budget drink options. Budget meals include lunch or dinner options that are typically priced at $3.50 and below, and drinks priced at $1.20 and below. May I ask the number and percentage of coffee shops leased from HDB which have come onboard to date? Are we on track to have all of the coffee shops leased from HDB offering budget meals? In a number of older HDB estates, many coffee shops there are bought and sold in the open market, and not leased from HDB. Hence, MND will need to work with the private operators to come onboard the Budget Meal initiative. How will MND encourage and incentivise them? So far, how many and what is the proportion of privately-owned coffee shops have joined the scheme? Finally, would the Ministry provide an update on the BudgetMealGoWhere portal, an online platform that helps the public find coffee shops offering budget meals and drinks? What has been the feedback on its usefulness so far? For senior citizens who have difficulty going online, how does the Ministry share with them updated information on where to go for budget meals? Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) funding is an important source of Government grants for improving HDB estates. CIPC projects cover basic infrastructure, recreational facilities and communal amenities, including playgrounds, fitness areas and linkways. For example, on multiple occasions in this House, I have asked about the quantum of CIPC funds given to each Town Council, so there is a clear quantifiable data point to indicate how much taxpayer money has been given to each Town Council. In 2017, the then Minister for National Development said that MND did not prescribe any standardised way for Town Councils to present the CIPC quantum. When I asked the same substantive question last year, the Minister replied that the amount of CIPC funding disbursed to each Town Council each year is based on the works completed by the Town Council as the implementing agent. The disbursement is reported in the respective Town Council's annual financial statements. The annual disbursement to the Town Councils includes CIPC projects approved over multiple years, as projects may take years and exclude CIPC projects implemented by the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs). Even though the disbursement is reported in the annual financial statements of all Town Councils, without a standardised way of presenting the information, tracking the absolute amount of CIPC funding channelled to each Town Council can be challenging and inaccurate, particularly if one compares the amounts disbursed by MND to PAP and opposition Town Councils. Prior to 2021, opposition Town Councils had to seek the agreement of the various Citizens' Consultative Committees under the charge of unelected People's Association (PA) advisors, including losing PAP candidates. In 2021, MND correctly changed the process for making CIPC nominations and Town Councils, in addition to CCCs, were allowed to propose projects for funding. Opposition Town Councils need not get the buy-in and support from CCCs that work exclusively with PA grassroots advisors anymore. In view of the change of approach since 2021, may I ask the Minister to answer these questions relating to all new CIPC proposals from 2021 to date? Could the Minister please name the top five Town Councils in terms of CIPC funds granted and the quantum extended to each Town Council respectively? Please also name the bottom five Town Councils and the quantum of CIPC funds granted to each respectively over the same period. Please include projects regardless of whether they came from the Town Councils directly or through the CCCs. How does the Committee decide which project proposals are approved and which are rejected by the CIPC committee? And finally, in this regard, would MND meet with elected opposition Town Councillors to discuss projects which it rejects? Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member): Chairman, I brought up in last year's Budget and COS debate that more can be done for persons with disabilities in the area of housing. The EASE programme is actually open to persons with disabilities regardless of age, on a case-by-case basis. However, speaking to people on the ground, not everyone is aware they can apply. The naming of the scheme suggests that the programme is meant for seniors only. MND should make it clearer that persons with disabilities of all ages can also benefit from EASE. Alternatively, could MND consider a similar but separate scheme for persons with disabilities? Those who require home modifications should be fully informed of their options to empower independent living at home. Under such a scheme, and this is a point I made last year, MND can then widen the list of improvement items that specifically cater to persons with disabilities beyond those with mobility challenges. Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang): Chairman, I speak again on the issue of lift upgrading for the five blocks of HDB flats in Hougang Single Member Constituency (SMC), namely Blocks 363, 830, 831, 832 and 835, where there are still some flats which do not have same-floor lift access. I have been raising this issue in Parliament every year since 2021. While I am glad that lift upgrading was offered to 10 more HDB flats at Block 833 last year, I hope the Minister can explain what the changes in circumstances for Block 833 were which do not apply to the other five blocks. In the past year, I continued to receive feedback from affected residents on their unhappiness over the lack of same-floor lift access for the remaining five blocks. The lack of lift access is still a very real issue for some of my affected residents, especially those with mobility needs requiring assistance to access the stairs outside their units when they have to go out, not to mention risks during emergencies. I have said previously that I would feel the pain when residents told me that their parents or grandparents had to be carried when accessing the stairs next to their units. Residents also have to pay additional charges for delivery items. As for the Lift Access Housing Grant, this is still not an option for many residents with whom I have spoken to. I was previously told by the Minister for National Development that, as of January 2023, there were about 140 HDB blocks with units without same-floor lift access. May I clarify with the Minister between January 2023 and February 2025, what is the total number of such blocks where the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) has since been offered or made available? I would also like to ask the Government, in the past five years, how many HDB flats without same-floor lift access had been provided with viable mechanical options on the adjoining staircase? I have also heard the Minister's explanation to the other MPs on 18 February this year, and I would again like to call on the Government to not just look at the issue of lift access from the angle of cost alone, something which could have been mitigated or avoided if HDB had tendered out lift upgrading projects consisting of blocks with problematic designs together with other HDB blocks with no design issues for LUP earlier. Of the remaining affected HDB units without same-floor lift access in Hougang, I hope HDB can provide an update as to which units still face technical constraints beyond the application of costly solutions and which units have not been offered LUP due to high cost alone. I hope HDB also inform residents in writing. This may also allow more in-depth study and better understanding on a stack-by-stack basis. Please also inform residents of the alternative mechanical options available and the cost involved. Please inform my Town Council so that it can convey HDB's explanation when asked by residents and it can also play a supportive role in the quest for solutions. In closing, I would like to call on the Government to consider giving same-floor lift access to all HDB flats where it is technically not impossible for access to be provided with the LUP, save for reason of cost. A greater subsidy should be given. After all, the design oversight is no fault of the flat owners, and it is a matter of equity for all HDB flat owners. Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast): Sir, 30 years ago, residents who bought segmented HDB units without lift access at the same level, prioritised privacy over convenience. Back then, climbing the stairs was not an issue. But today, as they age, many face mobility challenges and their priorities have shifted. What was once a desirable feature has become a source of hardship. Last month, one of my Nanyang residents, came to see me. She is 68 years old and lives in a segmented unit and suffers from weak knees, making stairs a daily struggle. Her sister-in-law, a stroke patient lives next door, also a segmented unit, faces even greater mobility challenges. Both wish to apply for a BTO flat with lift access, but as second-time applicants, their chances are slim. This is not an isolated case. It is a story shared by many residents living in segmented units across Singapore. That is why I urge the Minister for National Development to review the policy on segmented units. Out of the 140 segmented blocks in Nanyang, 14 blocks, or 10%, are in Nanyang, affecting 224 households. These residents are not asking for special treatment; they are asking for a fair chance to age with dignity and ease. To address this issue, I propose the following measures: One, install additional lifts in segmented blocks wherever it is technically possible. This is the best solution. Two, when adding lifts is not feasible or too costly, I urge HDB to consider the following: allow owners to sell their segmented flats back to HDB at market price, ensuring they are not financially disadvantaged; grant these owners the priority to apply for BTO flats, similar to first-time applicants, to improve their chances of securing a new home; waive the resale levy for owners who sell their segmented units and buy a BTO flat, removing a significant financial barrier; provide additional subsidies for purchasing another flat, with even greater support for families with members who have mobility issues. After buying back the segmented units, HDB should not resell them. Instead, HDB could collaborate with entities like hospitals to rent out these units to foreign nurses and medical workers, preventing the cycle from repeating. These measures would provide a permanent solution, ensuring no Singaporean is left behind as they age. Let us be decisive, take bold action to resolve this issue once and for all. Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied): Sir, there are three blocks with identical designs in my ward of Kaki Bukit Division of Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC), namely Blocks 528, 532 and 536 of Bedok North Street 3. Each of these blocks are 17 floors high, with a total of 192 units, served by two lift lobbies in each block. Although these three blocks are identical in design, Blocks 528 and 532 are served by a total of three lifts whereas Block 536 is only served by two lifts. Some residents of Block 536 shared with me that there used to be three lifts serving the block until the LUP was carried out. Sir, there are many elderly residents in Kaki Bukit, and Block 536 is no exception. They are particularly reliant on lifts. They have concerns over the wait times for the lifts and are confused why their block is seemingly deprived of one lift compared to the other two blocks of the same design. I therefore seek clarification from HDB on how it determines if a block has a sufficient number of lifts serving it, and secondly, on specifically on Block 536, why two lifts were deemed sufficient for this block, and I do hope that HDB can address this issue and provide the appropriate assistance to the residents of Block 536 of Bedok North Street 3. Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar): Chairman, Sir, I look after residents in several private estates in Jalan Besar GRC and wish to speak on their behalf. I appreciate that all Singaporeans, whether residing in public or private estates, benefit from the Government's efforts in national and civil defence, infrastructure, public transport, education, healthcare and other essential services. Housing type, of course, often serves as a proxy for resource allocation, especially for lower-income families with limited assets. However, when addressing issues like ageing, sustainability and recognising citizens' contributions, it is crucial to include private estate residents. I appreciate the Government’s responsiveness to us MPs in advocating for these residents, ensuring their inclusion in initiatives like the Merdeka and Pioneer Generations Packages, Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers, MND's EASE programme, Climate Vouchers and SG60 Vouchers. Private estate living offers advantages such as higher asset values, greater privacy and renovation flexibility, but it also comes with challenges, including self-management responsibilities. How can MND assist elderly residents in private estates to better age in place? For condominiums managing individual procurements, can MND facilitate sharing best practice in procurements in property management and maintenance? Could a dedicated agency mediate disputes between residents and Management Councils (MCs) to ensure fair and timely resolutions? How can the Government incentivise private condos to adopt sustainable practices, such as energy-efficient lighting or water-saving measures? Lastly, how can MND ensure residents have direct access to updated community news and opportunities to participate in social initiatives for all ages? These steps would enhance inclusivity and support for private estate residents. Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang): The Urban Redevelopment Authority’s (URA’s) long-term plan review highlights the Government's strategy of building inclusive and close-knit towns by improving connectivity and injecting amenities within neighbourhoods and close to homes. Unlike older HDB estates or new BTO estates for certain neighbourhoods, all precincts within Sengkang are currently underserved when it comes to the lack of coffee shops and everyday conveniences in the immediate neighbourhood. Hence, the Sengkang team has been actively exploring opportunities to bring greater F&B and commercial conveniences to our residents. For example, we studied the possibility of converting under-utilised spaces, such as unused multi-storey carparks, although I understand that technical limitations have rendered some of these proposals unfeasible. During the 2023 COS debate, in response to my call for the MND to address the lack of amenities within Sengkang, Senior Minister of State Sim Ann noted that URA and the relevant agencies are currently reviewing plans to further develop the Sengkang Town Centre. Therefore, would the MND be able to provide a status update to these plans? Moreover, with the recent decommissioning of Compassvale Bus Interchange, the site could be used to develop amenities, such as an integrated community development. The empty plot of land next to Compass One could also be better utilised for a permanent building, rather than merely for the occasional \"pasar malam\" in the interest of maximising land use while rejuvenating the wider Sengkang neighbourhood. Specifically for hawker centres, the NEA today manages 121 markets and hawker centres, and after decades of waiting, residents at Buangkok and Anchorvale can finally have their own hawker centre. I understand from the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment COS earlier that there will be five more hawker centres planned in the future. There is strong justification for another hawker centre to serve the needs of residents in the central and eastern regions of Sengkang, especially when the opportunity presents itself today, and especially when we consider that this is not just about the standalone hawker centre, but potentially an integrated development that will enable us to better maximise and achieve the highest and best use for the centrally located plots of land there. On improving connectivity, BTO developments, such as Rivervale Shores, include flats targeted at both seniors and families with young children. Hence, the HDB should proactively work with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to ensure that the surrounding infrastructure should be made barrier free, and also by retrofitting nearby overhead bridges with lifts ahead of the project's Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP). While there is unlikely to be many more new BTO estates in Sengkang, given limited areas for development, for the benefit of future residents of future BTO estates across Singapore, I hope that this can be included as part of tender requirements for contractors engaged by the HDB for new BTO projects. The Chairman: Mr Henry Kwek. Take your two cuts together. Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru): Chairman, in September 2024, the Government established the Task Force for Architectural and Engineering Consultants to tackle critical challenges in the built environment sector. This sector is fundamental to Singapore’s long-term urban development, sustainability, and economic resilience and ensuring its continued strength requires strategic transformation. The taskforce, co-led by Minister Indranee Rajah and Surbana Jurong Chairman, Chaly Mah, has been focusing on four key areas: one, enhancing the sector’s branding to attract young talent; two, modernising workforce to future-proof the industry; three, evolving business models to boost competitiveness; and four, promoting sustainability in line with Singapore’s green goals. With major national projects such as Changi Terminal 5 on the horizon, the success of this initiative is critical in building a resilient and future-ready industry. Can the Government provide an update on the task force’s progress in supporting the built environment consultancy sector? Over the years, MND has made tremendous strides in supporting seniors to age-in-place within the HDB estates. Today, many seniors benefit from highly subsidised home fittings under EASE 2.0, which helps frail seniors live more safely at home. Additionally, an increased number of Active Aging Centres (AACs) have been set up within HDB estates, providing seniors with space for social engagement, activities and community support. Moving forward, MND and Town Councils will work together through the Age Well SG programme to retrofit common areas, making public spaces more senior-friendly and accessible for all. MPs like myself from PAP Senior Wing certainly welcome these significant moves. This year, MND is extending these efforts to private estates, ensuring that seniors outside of HDB estates also receive meaningful support. This includes the rollout of EASE 2.0 for private estate seniors and the introduction of the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP)-Silver Estate, which will enhance common spaces and walkways to better support ageing residents. Beyond these efforts, can MND explore setting aside spaces in larger parks within private estates to host AACs as well as to help assisted living providers secure affordable locations near private estates, ensuring accessible home care and assisted living services for seniors who need them within the private estates? And in general, can MND share its vision for helping Singaporean seniors age-in-place within the private estates? The Chairman: Mr Chong Kee Hiong, please take your two cuts together. Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh): Chairman, a study by the Centre for Research on Successful Ageing (Rosa) at the Singapore Management University (SMU) found that eight in 10 older adults in Singapore prefer to age in their current homes, indicating a desire for familiarity and stability. For seniors living in private estates and who can afford it, ageing-in-place can be achieved through renovations to make their homes more elderly-friendly. However, for the group that is asset-rich and does not have sufficient cash resources, home improvements to suit their needs may not be an option. We are glad that MND has implemented EASE 2.0 to ensure that all seniors are able to age-in-place. With the successful implementation of the HDB Lease Buyback Scheme since 2009, has MND distilled learnings from the programme that can be applied to the private home market? While there are reverse mortgage packages available in the open market, would it be possible for MND to work with the banks to come up with reverse mortgage packages designed to suit the needs of seniors in private estates? Singapore is well-known internationally as a clean and green city. However, as a \"City in Nature\", we face the challenge of needing to balance the protection of ecosystems with the safety, cleanliness and comfort of residents. The increasing number of human-wildlife conflicts is one of the main problems highlighted by my constituents. I shared in this House two years ago, the problems of crows, mynahs and chickens in my estates. Today, the growing populations of crows and mynahs continue to disturb my residents. They are noisy, dirty and aggressive, and attack bewildered passers-by and residents. Over the years, Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council has received hundreds of reports and feedback about these birds. In addition to crow attacks, frequent and longstanding complaints include bird droppings on laundry, windows and ledges, food and rubbish messes created by their scavenging, and noise nuisance. The bird droppings are hygiene and health concerns. They affect the general aesthetics of the town and lead to higher maintenance costs. Town Councils need more assistance, resources and expertise from the National Parks Board (NParks) to remove nests, reduce shelters and food sources for these birds. To curb the population of these birds, which have become pests due to their numbers, would NParks please devise a new, holistic strategy? We also want to ensure that we are not chasing the flocks to other estates. Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon): Mr Chairman, I have three recommendations for MND to enhance Singaporeans' quality of life by optimising spaces and resources in our neighbourhoods. But first of all, I would like to urge an increase in support for the maintenance and repairs in older flats. Climate change has brought about unpredictable weather patterns, such as the prolonged monsoon in January, and with La Nina expected to bring more wet months this year, are our older public flats, many built in the eighties and nineties, equipped to withstand such conditions? Many of these flats are experiencing water seepage from roofs and external walls, leading to wet floors and increased fall risk, especially for the elderly. The current seven-year repair and redecoration cycle is insufficient. I urge MND to allocate additional resources for more frequent waterproofing maintenance in older flats to ensure safer living conditions. Other than funding, our experience managing complex water seepage cases has been very frustrating. In many cases, rectification works can drag for months to years, with residents having to bear with the water dripping into their homes, damage to furniture and fall risk aside, they often have to take leave from work for inspections with relevant personnel, ranging from Town Council property officers to HDB engineers. I urge MND to look into manpower and capability enhancements for the building and infrastructure group at HDB to help the team do their work better. How can HDB better equip resource and incentivise the engineers to achieve better rectification timelines? Two, to expand spaces for sports and recreation for active seniors? Tick tuck, tick tuck. This is not TikTok but the sound of a rising sport called pickleball. It is encouraging to see more seniors staying active through sports. However, in Nee Soon South, as well as in other constituencies, the demand for courts is rising with badminton, basketball, netball, sepak takraw and now pickleball competing for space. Our PA colleagues now struggle with juggling court allocations while promoting active lifestyles. With the growing momentum of active ageing, more seniors will remain mobile and eager to engage in sports. MND must plan ahead to meet this rising demand by repurposing underutilised spaces for recreation. Currently, some community gardens are located on multi-storey carpark top decks. But certain fruit trees are prohibited due to concerns about the root damage to the roofs. We can relocate these gardens to the green spaces between HDB blocks and convert the multi-storey car park rooftops into sports facilities. Installing safety netting along the sides and overhead will ensure that ball and record games can be played safely without concerns about errant shots going over parapets. Three, let us allow and encourage small plot planting in HDB front and backyards. Many elderly residents cultivate small gardens outside their ground floor units, growing flowers, papayas or banana trees. However, currently MND inspections classify these as defects. If the Town Council averages more than four defects per block in a year, its maintenance rating is downgraded to amber in the Town Council Management report. I urge MND to remove this rule and introduce a structured framework, allowing residents to cultivate these small plots as community food gardens. Guidelines can be established to ensure proper maintenance and prevent issues such as mosquito breeding. Additionally, incentives can be introduced to encourage best practices. I am grateful to the Singapore Land Authority for working with us closely in Nee Soon South to allow green spaces in our estates to be used for permaculture planting. This effort will benefit from a bigger and louder push from the Government through a national initiative to raise awareness and invite participation by residents. Organisations like the Circle for Human Sustainability, Edible Garden City and Project Black Gold, that talks about soil health, are examples of citizen-led groups that would love to partner the Government in this effort. I suggest that the very popular Community in Bloom programme run by NParks to be expanded with a new award category \"Community in Abundance\" to recognise gardeners whose efforts yield consistent and fruitful harvest. Imagine weighing in the papayas, pomelos, pumpkins and bitter gourds for the competition, and then distributing the fruits of this labour to friends and neighbours in the vicinity of each community. It would be a joyous experience for everyone involved. One caveat to ensure fairness and adherence to nature principles, we must stipulate that chemical fertilisers are not allowed and assessors must be equipped to detect the violation of these rules. Studies show that gardening provides significant health benefits, including improved physical activity, reduced stress, enhanced cognitive function, preventing depression, heart disease and dementia. The vision of little farms everywhere not only supports our food resilience, it also contributes to a healthier and more sustainable Singapore through both the physical activity and the nutritious low carbon produce. I urge MND to consider and implement these recommendations toward healthier lives in all our estates and neighbourhoods. The Chairman: Ms Joan Pereira, you can take your two cuts together. Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar): Chairman, my residents and I welcome the inclusion of private estates in the enhanced Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) to help our elderly living in these communities age in place. They are looking forward to the senior-friendly features, such as barrier-free access, rest points, therapeutic gardens and active health fitness trails. I understand the targeted and systematic approach taken by MND to launch: first, the new EUP for Silver Estates, where there is a higher concentration of seniors; followed by the EUP for Regular Estates later. However, there are currently different types of repairs and upgrades which may need to be done more urgently, regardless of the private estates' locations. These are the ones which pose safety and health concerns, such as lighting in certain areas, potholes and drain covers. These are to reduce tripping hazards and potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes, for example. How will MND ensure that repair and upgrading works in private estates are carried out expeditiously in view of safety and health concerns for residents? An increasing number of our HDB blocks are crossing the over 50-year mark. We need to rejuvenate our older estates so that they remain good homes for our people. For ageing blocks with widespread, common and recurring problems, I appeal to HDB to consider a review of its approach to such issues. Instead of ad hoc repairs, would HDB consider a holistic strategy to provide a sustainable, longer-term solution to deal with the systemic deterioration of affected HDB blocks? Two years ago in March, I shared in this House the numerous building problems plaguing my residents at Henderson Crescent estate. Many residents have to deal with water leakages, mould infestation and spalling concrete. Resident A has difficulty getting the cooperation of the upper floor unit to repair the ceiling leak. The mould on the ceiling smells. Her cabinets are damaged from rotting. The family is helpless under the leaking water and has to breathe in harmful mould spores every day. Resident B and her husband managed to get repairs done for their kitchen ceiling leak under the HDB Goodwill Repair Assistance (GRA) scheme. The GRA helped them to pay for their share of 25% of the repair cost. Their relief did not last long. The leaking problem resurfaced just nine months later in January this year. Resident C, an elderly stroke patient who lives alone, suffers from a double whammy. Water leaks into his unit from the flat above and his unit is leaking into the unit below. He will have to bear double, the co-sharing repair costs, which are a heavy financial burden on him. PA grassroots had offered him financial assistance for repairs, but he did not take them up for personal reasons. Such repairs are especially financially challenging for elderly residents without family support. Many residents in Henderson Crescent have expressed to me their desire for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS). If there are no plans for SERS, can the Ministry review the criteria for Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) on a case-by-case basis, depending on the particular condition of the blocks? Not all buildings will age uniformly. Would the Ministry share an update on its plans for ageing estates and review the Home Improvement Programme (HIP), SERS and VERS? The Chairman: Mr Lim Biow Chuan, please take your two cuts together. Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten): Sir, last year, URA launched various exhibitions and ramped up engagement efforts for the draft Masterplan review. In my constituency, there was a proposal to change the zoning of a plot of land at Amber Road from Reserve site to Residential Zone. Several of my residents have written appeals to object to the rezoning. They are concerned that their views will be obstructed once the new development is built. They also worry that there will be more traffic congestion in the area once the neighbouring land is developed. Sir, I am sympathetic to their views. After all, a property is one of the most expensive assets which a resident will buy in their lifetime. These residents bought the property with the expectation that there will not be increased density in the area and that their views of the sea will not be obstructed. May I ask MND or URA to clarify how will they take into account the public feedback received when drafting or finalising the public feedback? When I filed a Parliamentary Question in January this year, I was told that measures will be introduced to minimise traffic impact. What are these measures and how confident is URA or LTA that these measures to manage will actually work out? Sir, the construction industry is seen to be an industry which is dirty and non-appealing. However, Singapore depends on skilled workers and professionals to build their HDB flats, condominiums, factories, office space, bus depots and Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations. Without such skilled and competent workers, then the industry suffers as we will see the lowering of standards in the building and construction industry. The feedback which I received from many members of the public is that there is lack of transparency in the works being carried out by contractors. Sir, take for example, in my constituency, there is a sidewalk along Cassia Link and it has been cordoned off for many years for road widening works. Yet, for a period of time, no work has been done and the place remains cordoned off. There is no update as to the timeline for completion of the works. For my Mountbatten CC which is being rebuilt, the deadline for the issue of the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) keeps being moved to a later date without any explanation as to the reason for the delay. Surely, it makes more sense that once you start construction work on a site, the contractor should move quickly to carry out the work, complete the works expeditiously and then, the contractor can reinstate the site and move on to the next project. However, this does not seem to be the current situation. After a site is cordoned off, many a times, no work is carried out for a period of time. And the frequent reason given is that the contractor needs to get some permit or approval. Sir, this seems very inefficient to me. The Government launched the refreshed Built Environment Industry Transformation Map in September 2022, three years ago. Can the Government provide an update on the progress of industry transformation and some of its upcoming efforts to further accelerate this transformation? Will there be more support for construction firms so that we can have a pipeline of capable people in the industry? What about our efforts to attract engineers, architects and surveyors into the industry? Miss Rachel Ong (West Coast): Chairman, Singapore has long engaged both international and local architects for major projects. Some key examples: Jewel at Changi Airport, Marina Bay Sands and South Beach Development. Countries, like China and Korea, initially collaborated with international firms but have since transitioned to having local architects spearhead significant developments. Given Singapore's strong global reputation in urban planning, taking a similar approach could further strengthen the local architectural and design sectors. Does the Government plan to entrust future major public projects solely to local firms, providing them greater opportunities to showcase their capabilities? Additionally, are there initiatives to uplift Singapore's architectural and building design industry? If so, what do these plans entail? Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member): Mr Chairman, the Minister recently announced the establishment of a task force to help sustain and grow heritage businesses. While some heritage businesses continue to flourish, many have decided to exit permanently owing to economic pressures, rising costs, lower consumer demand and also succession issues. Could the Ministry and URA elaborate on the plans to support heritage businesses in the short and longer term? In particular, how can we help those where the next generation is committed to carry on but may need support in some areas? Heritage businesses are a part of our shared history. As a community, we can all play our part by patronising heritage businesses. Ms See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member): At its COS debate last year, the Minister spoke about the setting up of a tripartite workgroup for last-mile deliveries. The workgroup had showcased developments at the URA Urban Lab Exhibition last November. Could the Ministry provide an update on the workgroup's progress and upcoming plans? The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng, please take your three cuts together. Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): Sir, I once said in this House that I am a housefly when it comes to asking for more. Even as Minister Indranee swats and shoos me away, I keep coming back for more. I should clarify that the Minister actually does not always swat and shoo me away. On the issue of breastfeeding, I am grateful for her and her team for consulting and working together with the Breastfeeding Mother's Support Group to effect changes that will help so many breastfeeding mothers. I am glad we will amend the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment to lower GFA requirements for lactation rooms which will benefit many breastfeeding mothers. I am glad our voices have been heard, and many current and future breastfeeding mothers will benefit from this change in policy. So, for once, I shall not ask anymore. Thank you to the most sympathetic Minister, Minister Indranee. And now, I will ask for more. It is 2025 and we should finally ensure that all our housing policies are inclusive and do not discriminate against single unwed parents. Why do single unwed parents still not qualify for the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS)? Why is their application on a case-by-case basis? Single parents who are divorced or widowed qualify for PPHS, so why not single unwed parents? I can imagine how stressful it is to be a single unwed parent and our policies should help rather than discriminate against them. We ought to remember also that when we turn away a single unwed parent, are they really able to just rent in the open market, especially considering that many landlords do not want to rent to people with young children? Single unwed parents should be treated the same as others when applying for PPHS. We should end the discrimination and allow them to qualify for the PPHS. I have spent a good part of my life calling for HDB to allow the keeping of cats in HDB flats. Many have called for this and I am glad the Government has finally changed our policies and allow the keeping of cats in HDB flats. There is still an outstanding issue of people breeding cats and abandoning them, and this puts our new policy in jeopardy. Cats reproduce very quickly and unsterilised cats caterwaul. These are two important issues we need to resolve and we can do this through mandating the sterilisation of pet cats as a prerequisite for the keeping of cats in HDB flats. If this still cannot be done, then the Government should at least be given the power to mandate that someone has to sterilise their pet cats if the cats are found to cause disamenties in the community. The Chairman: Ms Joan Pereira, take your two cuts together, please. Ms Joan Pereira: Chairman, three years ago, I filed an Adjournment Motion on building harmonious communities through responsible use of common spaces in public housing estates. I shared about how residents of Skyville@Dawson had to put up with the disturbances and nuisance caused by inconsiderate visitors to the sky gardens at their HDB blocks. Unfortunately, these problems have not gone away. The troubles my residents face continue to be year-round but are worse during the weekends, eve of festive seasons and public holidays. Here are the top five complaints from my residents. First, noise disturbances at the sky garden. Groups of people regularly gather at the sky garden, making excessive noise late into the night, smoking and drinking. They show no regard for the people residing right next to the gardens. Second, public urination at staircase landings. Visitors have been urinating next to the staircase landing doors, with the pungent stench pervading all the surrounding homes. This is highly unhygienic and unacceptable. Third, smoking in stairwells. Individuals frequently smoke in the stairwells. Fourth, littering. There is an increasing amount of litter and rubbish at the sky gardens and staircase landings. Fifth, obscene activities. Evidence of obscene activities are littered around. Residents and I are aware that the gardens are public spaces. As I had highlighted before, public access is not a licence to abuse the usage of public spaces or behave inconsiderately and irresponsibly. Over the last few years, we have worked with HDB, Town Council, Residents' Committees, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Police to solve these problems. But disamenities still persist. Hence, I appeal to MND to reconsider some of our previous suggestions. First, install gantries for registration, limit the number of visitors and require payment of fees to support the operations and cleaning of the sky gardens. Registration will help to make visitors more conscious of how they behave. This method has been working well at another popular HDB rooftop terrace at the Pinnacle@Duxton. Non-residents need to register and pay a $6 fee to access the 50th storey rooftop via a turnstile gantry. Visitor numbers are limited to 200 per day. Second, install more CCTVs to monitor visitors and their activities. Together with the registration, the video evidence will aid the relevant Government agencies for enforcement of illegal activities, whether it is for littering, vaping or public indecency. The increasing number of hoarders in our residential estates are posing greater safety and health risks to our community. The hazards and deadly consequences of hoarding were brought to the fore by the Hougang flat fire, which killed a family of three hoarders in January. The authorities are concerned that the problem of hoarding will worsen with our ageing population and had set up the New Environment Action Team (NEAT). While I am heartened by this initiative, I urge MND to consider additional stricter measures concurrently. Timely resolution of hoarding issues is important because: first, of the ever-present risks; and second, the lack of progress sends a signal that hoarders can do what they please without consequences. This leads to many helpless neighbours suffering for years. Frustrated neighbours may lose faith in their community and the Government, and this is not at all helpful to building unity and neighbourly relations. The broken windows theory states that visible signs of disorder will lead to more disorder as it gives the appearance that no one cares and no one is in charge, which can lead a neighbourhood to deteriorate very quickly. For those who suffer from mental health problems, sympathy for them does not mean that we disregard their or their neighbours' safety, health and well-being indefinitely. Hence, hoarders with mental health issues should be required to accept professional assessment and treatment. For recalcitrant hoarders, MND may wish to consider introducing legislation to empower the authorities to relocate them. This may serve as a strong deterrent and warning to some hoarders. Mr Lim Biow Chuan: Sir, last year, during MND's COS I spoke on the need to take further action against pigeon feeders. It is a known fact that pigeons carry various bacteria and parasites which can be transmitted to humans through their droppings. Given that the pigeons are a potential health risk to residents, I urge NParks to do more to protect our residents from the possible health risks associated with pigeons. As Chairman of a Town Council, I keep receiving countless feedback about the mess left behind by pigeons. The pigeon faeces make a mess of the residents' clothes; make a mess on the windows, on the void deck; and pigeons would fly or walk into the food centre and attack the food while residents are having their meals. Sir, why should the majority of residents be put at risk and held hostage by a few irresponsible pigeon feeders? Sir, I repeat my call last year: the Government needs to better manage the pest bird situation and take action against pigeon feeders. Why are we so slow to do so even after the Town Council provides video evidence to NParks for enforcement? We can make the living environment better for all our residents if we take action against pigeon feeders promptly. The Chairman: Mr Xie Yao Quan, please take your two cuts together. Mr Xie Yao Quan: Chairman, perhaps only in Singapore are birds a major issue for the country's Members of Parliament. But pest birds are a huge pain point for many of our residents, in many of our estates. Pest birds steal food, they leave droppings on clothes and all over the place, create noise very early in the morning and, in extreme cases, cause injury to residents. And while the most effective way to manage the problem is to go upstream and control the pest bird population at source, by denying pest birds of their food sources in markets, hawker centres, coffeeshops and refuse collection centres; and by catching errant individuals who feed birds, including those who throw food out from out of their windows. We also need effective measures downstream, to quickly bring down a local pest bird population when it flares up from time to time, despite our upstream measures. So how does MND plan to strengthen our capabilities across the sector to manage this \"birds problem\" in our estates? Chairman, it was announced in the 2024 Committee of Supply that MSO has expanded the integrated municipal operations pilot to cover Pasir Ris-Punggol; and if the pilot continues to produce good results, MSO will scale this to more estates. How is the pilot going and is MSO planning to expand the pilot further? Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry: Chairman, recent high-profile animal cruelty cases highlighted a concerning trend in Singapore. In fact, in one of the worst cases of animal cruelty recently, a Singaporean was found guilty of throwing community cats off HDB blocks, resulting in their deaths. This case underscores the pressing need for stronger animal welfare protection. In 2024, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) reported 961 confirmed cases of animal cruelty and welfare concerns – the highest in 12 years. These include 283 cases of cruelty with abandonment being the most common, followed by physical abuse. And notably, there is a troubling increase in cases involving youths, rising from six in 2023 to 15 in 2024. In response to these developments, the NParks has initiated a review of the Animals and Birds Act to strengthen protections for animal welfare and health. Can NParks provide more details on the specific areas under review and the implementation timeline? Singapore's transformation into a City in Nature has been widely embraced by both Singaporeans and the global community. Beyond enhancing greenery and biodiversity, this vision has strengthened our urban environment, public well-being and climate resilience. To sustain and deepen this impact, greater community involvement will be key. One way is to leverage on larger neighbourhood parks, such as the Hillock Linear Park within Kebun Bahru, to anchor Active Ageing Centers or introduce signature activities like monthly Sunday Markets for private estates, fostering social interaction and community engagement. Another approach is for NParks to collaborate with the community to fund heritage displays in relevant parks. For example, working with the Hainan Clan Association to create mock-ups of the old village in the Thomson Nature Park. So, can NParks share its plans to involve more Singaporeans in the effort, empowering individuals, businesses and grassroots to get involved in NPark's City in Nature initiative? Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio): Mr Chairman, in July 2024, URA announced an exciting proposal that it will form an inter-agency Government team, with NParks and JTC, to build a new park around Sengkang West Industrial Estate, which is in Jalan Kayu and next to Cheng San-Seletar constituencies as well as Fernvale constituency, all of which are part of the Ang Mo Kio GRC. I would like to ask: one, how can interested Ang Mo Kio GRC residents living around the vicinity participate in giving ideas on what they hope to have in this new park? Two, can there be sheltered playgrounds, exercise and fitness gyms with equipment suitable for young people and seniors to use, so that residents can keep fit with these facilities, whether it rains or shines? Three, can there be a pets' corner, like a dog run, for pet-loving residents to bring their pets to enjoy the park too? Four, can there be a walk-and-jog track separate from a cycling track, for the safety of both pedestrians and cyclists? Five, can provision of space be made for a potential future MRT station at the corner this area, as it is strategically located opposite Fernvale, Cheng San-Seletar Hill and Jalan Kayu estates and which my fellow Ang Mo Kio GRC Members, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Ms Nadia Samdin and I have previously collectively hoped for and appealed to MOT for a feasibility study, to consider whether it can be done, so as to benefit Ang Mo Kio GRC residents living in all three constituencies in the future? And lastly, when can all these discussions of the ideas above be started, with me as an advisor and Member of Parliament of Jalan Kayu and where the Sengkang West Industrial Estate is sited. The Chairman: Ms Nadia Samdin, please take your three cuts together. Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio): Singapore is known around the world for integrating nature into our urban cityscape. We take pride in our green efforts to keep us cool and our natural spaces are an essential part of our cultural identity as an island city-state. I am grateful to NParks and the wider MND family for these efforts. MND announced the vision to transform Singapore into a city in nature back in 2020. Can we have an update on the progress made on this front? How will NParks continue to ramp up efforts, including maintaining and upgrading parks in private and public housing estates in a timely manner, to ensure equitable access to nature? In the past year, what has NParks done to involve more members of the community in our efforts to transform Singapore into a city in nature? What are the key initiatives planned for 2025? What is NParks doing to make green and blue spaces more accessible and inclusive for all Singaporeans? Being a city in nature also means learning to co-exist with Singapore's diverse wildlife and understanding that we share this island that we all call home. Yet, in the past years, we have had several encounters, from tapirs to crocodiles, otters to crows, chickens to koels. Our vision for every household to be within 10 minutes from a park, also means that inhabitants of the park are also 10 minutes from our households. I would also like to ask how MND organises itself and community groups, to tackle these very real human-wildlife concerns, including disamenities caused by urban birds, while staying true to our desire to be a city in nature. For example, in Ang Mo Kio, we have faced hygiene and noise challenges by pigeons, crows, chickens, mynahs and loss of fish from ponds, such as koi by otters, just to name a few. What are some best-in-class practices which MND has adopted in maintaining the balance between intensifying and preserving greenery as well as ecosystems, while developing housing estates around green, blue and brown spaces. Sir, safeguarding Singapore's blue and green spaces has long been a priority for MND. In December last year, NParks launched its most ambitious coral restoration project yet, the 100k Corals Initiative, which aims to plant 100,000 corals in degraded reefs and new sites. I applaud NParks for this programme, especially given that corals form the backbone of many of our marine ecosystems. Can MND provide more details on the 100k Corals Initiative, were there any target species we are trying to revive during this programme? And how will these efforts contribute to the diversity and vibrancy of our marine environment? How can we better involve the public and interested volunteers, for example, through citizen science activities? Has MND also considered whether mangrove trees, for example, can be part of our planted tree or coral programmes? A key component of protecting our Blue Spaces is educating the public about the rich biodiversity surrounding our shores and empowering them to take a personal interest in conserving our waters. To this end, groups, such as Friends of the Marine Park, play a critical role. The proposed designation of our Second Marine Park at Lazarus South Kusu Reef was a significant one, amidst the crowded competition for the use of our sea space and climate change. What are the updates that MND can share? And how can we continue to interest Singaporeans to care for our Blue Spaces, as part of our island city-state identity? Finally, Sir, Singapore's demographic has been evolving as our country matures, and two trends have grown increasingly clear. Our population is ageing and more people are choosing to remain single. These groups have distinct housing needs. First, seniors prefer to age in place. As this happens, the infrastructure in our housing estates must change to serve seniors' needs. To this end, HDB has taken several decisive steps to support seniors with both their external and internal living environments. Could MND provide a progress update on the take-up rate of the EASE 2.0 programme since its introduction, including the uptake and demographic of seniors who have benefited? I welcome the announcement, like many of my colleagues, to expand elements of EASE 2.0 to seniors not living in HDB flats. Could MND please provide more details? How will MND assess households who may require the support? In terms of their external living environment, what meaningful upgrades have been identified from community walks to be part of the Silver Upgrading Programme to transform our neighbourhood common spaces and encourage healthy living spans? How can MND work with other agencies, for example, Town Council, LTA and NParks, to ensure that the features are done in a way that is not duplicative. On behalf of my residents affected by SERS at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, Blocks 562 to 565, I would also like to ask what else can be done to help these residents in their relocation, especially the elderly who envisioned being able to age in place? Finally, what are some learnings from the single-room shared facilities typology, and is the Government looking to expand this? How is the Government continuing to improve the public rental scheme to support the evolving needs of Singaporeans, including reviewing the qualifying criteria? Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang): Sir, the Fresh Start Housing Scheme was implemented in 2016 to help second-timer families in public rental with young children to buy an HDB flat. It has been enhanced along the way. Some rental families in Woodlands have highlighted to me the challenges they face with the scheme. Some are not eligible, for example, single parents and first-timers, who form a not insignificant and growing share of new public rental households today. Others are eligible but continue to struggle with financial stability or continuous employment and find the upfront of regular payments difficult. They are looking for higher grants or extended loan tenures. ComLink+-style support in terms of financial counselling and employment support would also help. Sir, we are committed to an inclusive and supportive housing system that ensures that every family has a fair shot at home ownership and a brighter future. To that end, can the Minister provide an update on the take-up and success rate of the scheme to-date? Budget 2025 announces new enhancements. How else can the Government support more low-income families that are currently renting to buy their home? Further, would the Government consider extending the Fresh Start Housing Scheme to families that are really struggling but not staying in public rental, as is being considered for the ComLink+ plans? Committee of Supply Reporting Progress The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah): Mr Chairman, may I seek your consent to move that progress be reported and leave be asked to sit again? The Chairman: I give my consent. [(proc text) Resolved, \"That progress be reported and leave be asked to sit again.\" – [Ms Indranee Rajah]. (proc text)] Mr Speaker: Minister Indranee. Ms Indranee Rajah: Mr Speaker, I report that the Committee of Supply has made progress on the Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 2025/2026 and ask leave to sit again tomorrow. Mr Speaker: So be it. Leader. Adjournment [(proc text) Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" – [Ms Indranee Rajah]. (proc text)] Adjourned accordingly at 6.49 pm. Direct Subsidies for Patients Participating in Pilot for Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening 9 Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry will consider providing direct subsidies to patients participating in the pilot for Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening (PGS) instead of only providing funding to support the manpower and operations of the PGS laboratory, and half of the PGS consumables costs. Mr Ong Ye Kung: Pre-implantation Genetic Screening (PGS) is still a pilot and it is premature to consider subsidies until we have properly evaluated the programme for both clinical and cost effectiveness. In the meantime, we have provided pilot funding to the programme so that PGS is more affordable for eligible patients. Accessibility of Shingles Vaccination to Those Who May Not Qualify for Subsidies and Alternative Preventive Treatments 10 Mr Yip Hon Weng asked the Minister for Health following the introduction of subsidies for shingles vaccination from September 2025 (a) how does the Ministry plan to ensure accessibility and affordability for those who may not qualify for subsidies; and (b) whether there are alternative preventive measures or treatments beyond vaccination to reduce the risk or severity of shingles among seniors. Mr Ong Ye Kung: Subsidies will be available to all Singaporeans and Permanent Residents who meet the eligibility criteria for shingles vaccination under the National Adult Immunisation Schedule. These criteria are based on an individual's susceptibility to shingles infection or increased risk of complications. Individuals who are not eligible for subsidies are less susceptible to shingles infection. Nevertheless, they can still benefit from the reduced price that the Ministry of Health has negotiated with the vaccine manufacturer, if they receive the vaccine at CHAS general practitioner clinics or public healthcare institutions. Utility of Holding Cryptocurrency Investments in Singapore Sovereign Wealth Funds' Portfolios 11 Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim asked the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Ministry considers there is utility in holding cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, in Singapore sovereign wealth funds' holdings. Mr Chee Hong Tat: Our investment entities make professional investment decisions with a long-term orientation. They invest in assets anchored to underlying economic fundamentals and with the potential for longer-term value increase. Cryptocurrencies do not fit this profile. They are highly speculative instruments, prone to extreme price volatility and lack intrinsic value derived from cash flows, earnings or tangible assets. Factors Affecting Percentage of Rental Units in Each Plus and Prime HDB BTO Development 12 Mr Pritam Singh asked the Minister for National Development (a) what percentage of Plus and Prime BTO developments comprise rental units, on average; and (b) how does HDB determine the number of rental units for each Plus or Prime development. Mr Desmond Lee: Since the new flat classification framework was implemented in October 2024, four in 10 of the Plus and Prime Build-to-Order (BTO) projects launched included public rental flats. These rental flats comprise 5% of all flats across the 10 projects. The Housing and Development Board (HDB) builds rental flats in these projects to ensure that our neighbourhoods continue to have a good social mix and remain inclusive. In determining whether and how many rental flats to build in a given project, HDB looks at several factors, including the projected demand and supply of rental flats and the geographical spread of rental flats across the island. Investigation into Meeting of Premium Cab Drivers at Changi Airport on 13 February 2025 13 Mr Xie Yao Quan asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there is any police investigation into the meeting of drivers of premium cabs at Changi Airport on 13 February 2025. Mr K Shanmugam: The Police made enquiries shortly after the incident and established that the meeting was a pre-planned dialogue to discuss the drivers' concerns over the introduction of minibus services at Changi Airport. There was no strike or protest involved and no law-and-order issues arose during the meeting. Police have assessed that there is no offence disclosed and will not be investigating further. Sequence of Events Leading To Recent Meeting of Premium Cab Drivers at Changi Airport and Regulation of Ground Transport Concierge Operations at Changi Airport 14 Mr Leong Mun Wai asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether LTA plays a role in regulating the Ground Transport Concierge (GTC) operations at the Changi Airport, in particular, in ensuring that there is a level playing field for taxi drivers in the provision of transportation services at Changi Airport; and (b) if so, what is being done by LTA to investigate the allegations made by the taxi drivers and promote fair practices in the provision of transportation services at Changi Airport. 15 Mr Xie Yao Quan asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the detailed sequence of events leading up to the meeting of drivers of premium cabs at Changi Airport on 13 February 2025; and (b) what lessons can be drawn to prevent a similar situation from arising in future. Mr Chee Hong Tat: The Changi Airport Group (CAG) has engaged Woodlands Transport Service (WTS) since 2008 to manage Changi Airport's Ground Transport Concierge (GTC). The GTC provides passenger booking and driver coordination services for a range of transport options, including six- to seven-seater large-taxis and limousine taxis. This is a commercial arrangement between CAG and WTS. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and Land Transport Authority are not involved in the GTC operations. On 1 February 2025, CAG and WTS introduced an eight-seater minibus service, operated by WTS, in response to growing demand by passengers for more transport options using larger vehicles. Unfortunately, a WTS ground manager had allowed WTS minibuses to park in front of the GTC counter, which was meant to be the staging area for the large-taxis. This led to perceptions among some of the drivers of large-taxis that WTS was according preferential treatment to its own minibus service. The arrangement was not approved by CAG. On 13 February 2025, about 50 drivers of large-taxis at GTC met with WTS to express their unhappiness with the minibus service. The National Taxi Association (NTA) alerted CAG to the meeting and both NTA and CAG representatives were present on the ground to engage the drivers. After hearing the drivers' concerns, CAG immediately suspended the minibus service. Thanks to the support from the NTA and driver association leaders, who had stepped in to manage the situation, there was no disruption to the taxi services at Changi Airport. Going forward, CAG has strengthened its oversight of WTS operations at GTC. WTS has also removed the ground manager from his role. CAG will work closely with tripartite partners, including the NTA and taxi drivers, to engage them directly and regularly on any changes at GTC, to secure their support prior to implementation. This incident shows the importance of tripartism. While there may be disagreements and disputes between stakeholders from time to time, our close tripartite relationship allows these to be resolved via mediation and reconciliation, rather than through conflict and confrontation. Decisions around Sterilisation, Trapping and Euthanisation of Monkeys in Punggol 16 Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim asked the Minister for National Development in respect of the sterilisation programme for monkey population in the vicinity of Punggol (a) whether the sterilisation is performed only at specific sites with confirmed overpopulation of monkeys as supported by a population study and a projected estimated increase in population; (b) how many macaques have been trapped by NParks in 2024; and (c) how many of the trapped macaques have been sterilised and euthanised, respectively. Mr Desmond Lee: As highlighted in past replies to several Members' queries about the National Parks Board's (NParks') wildlife management approach, NParks takes a science- and community-based approach to manage the monkey population and encounters in Singapore. As part of these efforts, NParks studies the population ecology of monkeys and the findings inform its measures. NParks also partners stakeholders to minimise human sources of food by ensuring proper refuse management, enforcing against feeding and putting in place measures to guard monkeys away from urban areas. In areas with higher reported human-monkey conflict, NParks intervenes to protect public safety. This includes the implementation of long-term population control measures, such as sterilisation and removal of monkeys that display more aggressive or intrusive behaviour. At Punggol, NParks has received several reports of human-monkey conflict. To manage the monkey population, NParks conducted extensive research and assessment on the population before implementing sterilisation in Punggol. In 2024, NParks trapped 50 monkeys in the Punggol vicinity, of which the majority were then sterilised. To safeguard public safety, some monkeys that display more aggressive or intrusive behaviour were removed. NParks has also been working closely with stakeholders, such as the Grassroots Advisers and Town Council, to engage the Punggol community on the mitigation measures and what to do during monkey encounters. We can all play our part to minimise wildlife intrusions by refraining from feeding wildlife, keeping our residential areas clean and appreciating wildlife from a safe distance. Disposable Carrier Bags Saved Since Introduction of Mandatory Charge and Plans to Include All Retailers 1 Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the estimated number of disposable carrier bags that have been saved since the mandatory disposable carrier bag charge was introduced in larger supermarkets on 3 July 2023; and (b) whether there are any plans to expand the scheme to all retailers. Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: Since 3 July 2023, supermarket operators with an annual turnover of more than $100 million are required to charge a minimum of five cents per disposable carrier bag provided at their supermarket outlets. In the first year of implementation, supermarket operators who started charging for disposable carrier bags reported a 70% to 80% reduction in the number of bags issued at their supermarket outlets. Some non-obligated retailers have voluntarily implemented a bag charge or have stopped providing disposable carrier bags. There are currently no plans to expand the mandatory bag charge to all retailers. Restoring Public Confidence in Safety of Ready-to-eat Meals in Resilience Programmes 2 Mr Yip Hon Weng asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what steps are being taken to restore public confidence in the safety of ready-to-eat meals used in resilience programmes; and (b) whether there are plans to conduct public demonstrations or education initiatives on the rigorous food safety measures in place. Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien: The question has been addressed in the combined reply on the food safety of Ready-to-Eat meals at the 4 March 2025 Parliament Sitting. [Please refer to \"Causes for Recent SOTA Students Food Poisoning Incident and Details of Shelf-life Product Testing under Food Resilience Preparedness Programme\", Official Report, 4 March 2025, Vol 95, Issue 157, Oral Answers to Questions section.] The question has been addressed in the combined reply on the food safety of Ready-to-Eat meals at the 4 March 2025 Parliament Sitting. Proportion of Work Hours Teachers Spent Teaching and Preparing for Lessons in 2022 and 2023 3 Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang asked the Minister for Education for 2022 and 2023 respectively, whether the time that teachers spend teaching and preparing to teach is more than or less than 50% of their work hours. Mr Chan Chun Sing: More. Proven and Withdrawn Child Abuse Allegations in Divorce and Child Custody Cases 4 Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in each year of the last three years, how many cases where one spouse makes an allegation of child abuse against the other spouse in attempting to prevent the other spouse from having access to their children in divorce and child custody cases have been (i) proven true or (ii) subsequently withdrawn, respectively. Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M: Over the last three years, an annual average of 13 cases involving allegations of child abuse made by one spouse against the other, purportedly to limit access to their children in divorce and custody disputes, were investigated. Of these cases, roughly seven were confirmed as true, while about six were subsequently found to be unsubstantiated. Attrition Rates of Specialists at Public Hospitals and Steps to Ensure Healthy Ratio of Specialists to Patients 5 Ms Hazel Poa asked the Minister for Health (a) since 2020, which medical specialties have seen the highest attrition rates of specialists at public hospitals; and (b) what steps are being taken to reduce attrition rates and ensure a healthy ratio of specialists to patients. Mr Ong Ye Kung: The average attrition rates of various specialists ranged from 1% to 7% over the past few years. However, for specialties that have fewer doctors, each resignation can translate to a significant percentage and are, hence, subject to higher year to year variability in attrition rates. We continue to plan long term and maintain a healthy training pipeline of new specialists across all fields to meet healthcare needs. Moving forward, as Singapore ages, the more critical need in clinical manpower is less likely to be for specialists, but doctors with broader skills that can coordinate and integrate care across specialists. Hence, we have been training more Family Physicians to anchor primary and community care, and Hospital Clinicians to anchor hospital-based care. Impact on Well-being of Children from Prolonged Exposure to Delayed Removal of Harmful Online Content 6 Mr Yip Hon Weng asked the Minister for Digital Development and Information (a) whether the Ministry can provide insights into the impact of prolonged exposure caused by delayed removal of harmful contents by social media platforms on the well-being of children; and (b) what targeted measures are being considered to ensure social media platforms prioritise the timely removal of contents that pose significant risks to vulnerable users. Mrs Josephine Teo: The Government seeks to protect vulnerable users, especially children, from harmful and age-inappropriate content on social media services. The Infocomm Media Development Authority's (IMDA's) Code of Practice for Online Safety requires social media services with significant reach or impact to put in place online safety measures, including differentiated measures for young users. Six Designated Social Media Services (DSMSs) were assessed recently for the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of these measures. X and HardwareZone were found to have shortcomings in user safety measures for children. For example, the services' own community guidelines for children were frequently breached, resulting in children being more exposed to age-inappropriate content than was desirable. Even for DSMSs that did better in this area, such as Facebook and YouTube, children could still access some age-inappropriate content. Other than user safety features, DSMSs should improve on the effectiveness and timeliness of their response to user reports. More often than not, content that violated the services' community guidelines were not removed even after users reported their presence. Most DSMSs also took an average of five days or more to act on these user reports. These findings show that DSMSs need to step up efforts to protect users on their platforms. IMDA has engaged DSMSs to do so and will review their responses when their next annual online safety reports are due in June 2025. In addition, IMDA is studying how social media services should use age assurance technology to better protect children and youth from age-inappropriate content. As to the impact of prolonged exposure, the Ministry of Digital Development and Information does not have authoritative findings to share. Nonetheless, we will continue to monitor DSMSs' efforts to enhance online safety. Ensuring Consistent Connectivity in Areas Served by Broadband Service Providers 7 Ms Mariam Jaafar asked the Minister for Digital Development and Information what steps are taken to ensure that broadband service providers do not leave pockets of poor broadband connectivity in fully connected areas. Mrs Josephine Teo: Our Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) that provide mobile broadband services have achieved over 99% nationwide outdoor mobile coverage for their 4G networks; and over 95% nationwide outdoor mobile coverage for their 5G networks. MNOs are also required to meet the Quality of Service standard for 4G coverage of over 85% per building, as well as over 99% coverage for nationwide outdoor areas and all roads or mass rapid transit tunnels. The Infocomm Media Development Authority regularly monitors the performance of these services and will require the service providers to improve their performance to meet the requirements if there are gaps. PHCs Registered for Ride-hailing Services Sold to Individuals or Converted Out of Chauffeured PHC Scheme 8 Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong asked the Minister for Transport in each year of the past five years, how many private hire cars registered by businesses for ride hailing services were sold to individuals or otherwise converted out of the chauffeured Private Hire Car scheme, less than three years after they were first acquired by such businesses. Mr Chee Hong Tat: The Ministry of Transport will be sharing more details regarding the review of the point-to-point transport sector at the upcoming Committee of Supply debate and this question will be addressed then. Clarification by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment [(proc text) The following statement was made in the reply given by the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien) during Question Time for Question Nos 1 to 3 at the Sitting of 4 March 2025: (proc text)] The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien): I think that we are working as quickly as we can. In the meantime, we have suspended this programme. The RTE meals are actually isolated and controlled, so we do not see that going into the public. So, there is no urgency from a food safety point of view. The packages are all collected, so we are not continuing with this programme for the time being. [Please refer to \"Causes for Recent SOTA Students Food Poisoning Incident and Details of Shelf-life Product Testing under Food Resilience Preparedness Programme\", Official Report, 4 March 2025, Vol 95, Issue 157, Oral Answers to Questions section.] [(proc text) Written statement by Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien circulated with leave of the Speaker in accordance with Standing Order No 29(5): (proc text)] I wish to make the following factual correction to my reply during the Sitting of 4 March 2025. My reply should read as follows: The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien): I think that we are working as quickly as we can. In the meantime, we have suspended this programme. The RTE meals are actually isolated and controlled, so we do not see that going into the public. So, there is no urgency from a food safety point of view. The packages are being collected, so we are not continuing with this programme for the time being."}
