The hon. Members wishing to take the Oath of Allegiance will please come forward when their names are called.\n\nThe following Members made Affirmation of Allegiance in the order below:\n\nMr S. Rajaratnam (Kampong Glam)\n\nMr Phua Bah Lee (Tampines). ELECTION OF DEPUTY SPEAKER: 2.32 p.m.\n\nThe Leader of the House (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose that Mr Tang See Chim, Member for Chua Chu Kang, be elected as Deputy Speaker of this House.\n\nSir, Mr Tang's professional background, coupled with his experience both in this House and in Government, make him eminently suitable to assist you in discharging the responsibility of your high office.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have great pleasure in seconding the proposal.\n\nMr Speaker: There being only one proposal, I declare Mr Tang See Chim to have been duly elected as Deputy Speaker of this Parliament.\n\nPUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE ESTIMATES COMMITTEE (Appointment of Chairmen) Announcement by Mr Speaker\n\nMr Speaker: I have to inform hon. Members that, under the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) respectively of Standing Order No. 95, I have appointed Mr J. F. Conceicao to be Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and Mr Hwang Soo Jin to be Chairman of the Estimates Committee.\n\nORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ROV ENFORCEMENT SQUAD (Particulars)\n\n1. Mr J. F. Conceicao asked the Minister for Communications what the actual strength is, in terms of personnel and machines, of the Enforcement Squad of the Registry of Vehicles, and whether it is sufficient for current traffic conditions.\n\nThe Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng) (for the Minister for Communications): Mr Speaker, Sir, a total strength of 80 men is provided for the Enforcement Squad for this financial year (1972-73). At the moment, the Enforcement Squad is functioning with 32 men. Details of the number of authorised posts available for this year and the number of posts filled so far are as follows:\n Post Number of Posts filled\n\nof Authorised Posts to-date\n\n(1972/1973)\n\nAsst.Superintendent\n\nof Police 1 1\n\nInspector 1 1\n\nStaff Sergeants 2 -\n\nSergeants 4 2\n\nCorporals 12 -\n\nConstables 60 28\n\n-- --\n\n80 32\n\n== ==\n\nMany of the posts are vacant due to difficulty in recruitment faced by the Police Force. The posts of Staff Sergeants and Corporals are to be regarded in line with the recommendations of the Lee Soo Ann Report on the Police Force.\n\nThe ROV Enforcement Squad has a fleet of 40 motor-cycles, which is the number authorised for this financial year.\n\nThe ROV Enforcement Squad is a supplementary force to the Mobile Squad of the Traffic Police. It was established primarily to deal with offences relating to the duties and responsibilities of the ROV. These include monitoring the conduct and behaviour\n\nof operators of public service vehicles, dealing with road tax offences and other enforcement action as well as assisting in the implementation of certain policies recommended in the White Paper on \"Reorganisation of the Motor Transport Service of Singapore\" (Command Paper 21 of 1970).\n\nIf all the vacant posts could be filled, the force of 80 men and 40 motor-cycles would be sufficient. However, in spite of the shortage of manpower, every effort is being made to see that the Squad functions as efficiently as possible. In the month of September, for instance, a total of 765 vehicles were interdicted by the ROV for the following offences: Type of Offences Number of\n\nVehicles\n\nInterdicted\n\nNon-Payment of Road Tax 247\n\nSmoky Exhaust 190\n\nNoisy Exhaust 8\n\nGeneral Condition 113\n\nOverloading 202\n\nOthers 5\n\n---\n\n765\n\n===\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy (Anson): Sir, will the Minister of State for Communications consider the staggering of office hours to ease traffic congestion in the city area?\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng: Sir, to some extent, office hours in the city area have already been staggered. Perhaps a greater measure of it would help to ease the traffic.\n\nMr J. F. Conceicao (Katong): Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister of State not agree that, in respect of monitoring the conduct and behaviour of operators of public service vehicles, an expeditious increase in the present corps of ROV personnel would serve to act as a disciplinary measure against the behaviour of bus operators, especially along public roads?\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng: Since the Member for Katong has mentioned the behaviour of public bus operators, which leaves much to be desired, let me say that we have been trying our best to solve this problem, and a certain amount of measure has been taken. Recently we have introduced a nation-wide campaign to encourage road courtesy, with greater emphasis on road safety.\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu): Sir, I would like to ask the Minister of State if he would inform this House as to the criterion adopted by the Ministry in judging the efficiency of the personnel attached to the ROV. I hope it is not based just on the number of summonses issued!\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng: As I have pointed out in my answer, we are actually operating with 32 men out of an authorised strength of 80, from the efforts put in by these 32 men in keeping order on our roads, one could grant that there is efficiency in this Force.\n\nMr Conceicao: In view of the sterling efforts that have been shown by the 32 men, would it not be better if we have the full complement of this Enforcement Squad as early as possible, and will the Ministry make all efforts to see that this complement is reached?\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng: The difficulty of recruitment into this Enforcement Squad is something that is beyond our control. This problem is also faced by the Police Force as a whole. It is, of course, desirable that we get our full complement of officers as soon as possible.\n\nTRAFFIC POLICE MOBILE SQUAD (Particulars)\n\n2. Mr J. F. Conceicao asked the Minister for Health and Home Affairs what the actual strength is, in terms of personnel and machines, of the Mobile Squad of the Traffic Police, and whether it is sufficient for current traffic conditions.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Mobile Squad of the Traffic Police has a total strength of 155 officers and 89 motor-cycles. Action is being taken to increase the number of personnel and machines to the authorised strength of 184 officers and 164 motor-cycles. The Mobile Squad at full strength should be able to cope with current traffic conditions.\n\nMr Conceicao: May I ask a rather hoary question as to when the full strength will be achieved?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Vacancies with regard to personnel are mainly due to retirement or resignation of officers. Recruitment exercises are now being carried out to fill them.\n\nMr Conceicao: Sir, can the Mobile Squad motor-cycles be equipped at least with radio communications, so that this would improve the control of traffic on the roads?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Of course, the Traffic Police welcomes more up-to-date equipment, so that they can be more efficient and more effective. We will discuss the matter with the other ministries with a view to getting more up-to-date equipment.\n\nIMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT (Public relations)\n\n3. Dr Tan Eng Liang asked the Minister for Health and Home Affairs if he will look into the cultivation of proper attitudes of the staff of the Immigration Department in their dealings with the public.\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, all Immigration staff on recruitment undergo training for a period ranging from one to four weeks before they are deployed at the various offices and check-points. During the training they are instructed among other things to be courteous and helpful to members of the public, as they are working in a department which has constant dealings with the public.\n\nServing members of the Immigration staff are regularly reminded to be courteous and polite in dealing with the public. Departmental circulars on courtesy and correct attitude towards the public have been issued from time to time. Since June last year, seven such circulars were issued and the latest one was issued on the 18th October, 1972. Further, senior officers of the Department from time to time give lectures and briefings to the staff that their rudeness to the public will not be tolerated. There were occasions when disciplinary action was taken against members of the staff for being discourteous to the public. A Deputy Assistant Controller of Immigration, a Division II officer, was dismissed in 1969 for being rude to a member of the public.\n\nMembers of the public who know of specific instances of discourtesy or rudeness by any of the Immigration staff are invited to write to my Ministry, giving details. Immediate investigations will be instituted and appropriate action taken, including dismissal wherever necessary. However, general allegations of discourtesy without giving specific details will not be helpful.\n\nREGISTRY OF COMPANIES (Improvement measures)\n\n4. Dr Tan Eng Liang asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider taking measures to improve the workings and efficiency of the Registry of Companies as the watch-dog and supervisory body under the Companies Act.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Sir, I am always ready to consider measures to improve the working and efficiency of the Registry of Companies as I am with any other Department in my Ministry. Perhaps the hon. Member would indicate or write to me indicating the deficiencies that he considers should be remedied.\n\nDr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley): Sir, I shall be happy to supply the Minister with the necessary information.\n\n2.46 p.m. BILLS INTRODUCED CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT) (PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL FOR MINORITY RIGHTS) BILL\n\n\"to amend the Constitution of Singapore\",\n\npresented by the Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker); read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. TRADE UNIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Trade Unions Act (Chapter 129 of the Revised Edition)\",\n\npresented for the Minister for Labour by the Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui); read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Road Traffic Act (Chapter 92 of the Revised Edition)\",\n\npresented by the Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin); read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Arms and Explosives Act (Chapter 238 of the Revised Edition)\",\n\npresented by the Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin); read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. MISUSE OF DRUGS BILL: \"to provide for the control of dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs and for purposes connected therewith and to repeal the Dangerous Drugs Act (Chapter 151) and the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act (Chapter 154)\",\n\npresented by Mr Chua Sian Chin; read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n2.50 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, there is a need to increase the membership of the Public Service Commission because of the increased workload placed on the Members of the Commission. The Commission meets weekly. The Members also have to act as chairmen of Selection Boards which deal with the recruitment and promotion of civil servants and, sometimes, employees of statutory boards. A Member may have to attend at least three meetings in a week in his capacity as chairman of a Selection Board. In addition to these duties, each Member may be delegated certain powers to decide on matters relating to the recruitment, confirmation, promotion and disciplinary control of civil servants. These matters take up a lot of time.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr E. W. Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\n\nPARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) BILL\n\nOrder for Second Reading read.\n\n2.52 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, section 15 of the Parliamentary Elections Act requires the electoral registers for each electoral division to be revised annually before the 31st of\n\nDecember in each year, or such later date as the Minister may appoint. The revision of the electoral registers for the year 1971 was completed in May 1972, and we went to the polls on the 2nd September last. It is unlikely that any by-election will be held before the end of this year and, for reasons of economy, it is proposed to dispense with the revision of the electoral registers for the year 1972.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n2.54 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nHonourable Members will recall that a 13th month salary was paid to civil servants in March this year. In fact, for reasons which I have already stated in this House, a second 13th month salary, which will otherwise be paid in March next year, will be paid in December of this year instead. This payment is intended to be an annual non-pensionable allowance, an allowance which would attract a Central Provident Fund contribution at the revised rate of 12 per cent. At the same time, because of the increase in the CPF rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, all pensionable employees in the Government service were required to make a two per cent CPF contribution with effect from April 1972 on their monthly emoluments, with a matching contribution from the Government. These contributions to the CPF are intended as additional benefits `over and above the pension benefits.\n\nAs the Pensions Act stands, any period of service during which a Government employee was a member of the Central Provident Fund cannot be reckoned for benefits under the Pensions Act, unless he first pays back to the Government any CPF contributions made by the Government on his behalf. This is a requirement under section 60 (I) of the Act. In view of the changed circumstances since April 1972, when pensionable employees were required to contribute two per cent of their emoluments to the Central Provident Fund in respect of their pensionable service, it is necessary to amend section 6 of the Pensions Act. This amendment will allow a pensionable employee to retain the two per cent CPF contribution paid by Government on his account when he eventually retires from the service.\n\nSection 16 of the Act is also similarly affected, and a consequential amendment is required. This section provides for the payment of a death gratuity when an officer dies in service, or within one year of his retirement. The amending Bill, when passed, is to be made retroactive from 1st April, 1972, which is the date on which contributions to the Central Provident Fund were made for pensionable Government employees.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING BOARD BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.00 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, in 1959 when the Government embarked on transferring Singapore's economy on to an industrial base, we determined that the large proportion of the workforce would in due course be industrially employed. This meant that the development of a skilled industrial workforce would assume growing importance, as Singapore's national income became increasingly dependent on the output and productivity of industry. Industrial training has therefore been recognised as a major instrument of economic policy.\n\nThus, as a matter of national urgency, the National Industrial Training Council was established in April 1968 to deal with the immediate problem of developing and co-ordinating technical education and industrial training to meet this need. Two months later the Technical Education Department was specially formed within the Ministry of Education to execute the targets established by the Council. In the short space of four years, the Technical Education Department has substantially achieved the initial targets set out and laid a firm foundation for the development of a skilled industrial workforce.\n\nSir, I should like, at this juncture, to correct certain mis-impressions about our vocational institute graduates and the value of the training they have received, which would otherwise undermine what has so far been accomplished.\n\nBefore the new vocational institutes were established, the main supply of workers with any vocational training at all came from the vocational schools. Because of the similar name, vocational institutes have often been confused with vocational schools, which now no longer exist. This confusion is most unfortunate. Admittedly, many former vocational school students were drop-outs from the school system. The vocational institutes, on the other hand, cater for those with a reasonably high level of education who wish to learn a practical skill. Industries show a distinct preference for these graduates. The value of their\n\ntraining has also been recognised by the Public Service Commission.\n\nThe vocational institute graduates have been trained at heavy public subsidy specially to undertake industrial employment and I am, therefore, naturally perturbed lest doubts about their value should take hold. No effort has been spared to explain to the public, through the mass media and other means, the many developments which have taken place in industrial training since 1968. Any misconceptions and prejudices which still persist, even among a small sector of the population, could be very damaging.\n\nThe best way to stamp out these unfavourable attitudes and to ensure that training programmes receive the fullest acceptance and recognition is to develop close co-operation between the Government, industry and labour. The growth of such co-operation will become increasingly necessary in the next stage of industrial training, as it is envisaged that the further skill-development of the basic-trained worker can most effectively be undertaken by and within industry. It is for these reasons that an Industrial Training Board is being proposed to centralise, co-ordinate and intensify industrial training. A statutory board will enable industry and labour to participate more fully towards common goals. It will have more flexibility in an area where slowness to respond to changing conditions can result in high training wastage on the one hand and critical skill shortages on the other. A board will also be better able to deal with the problems of disseminating the right kind of conceptions about industrial training.\n\nWhen the responsibility for industrial training becomes vested in the Board, technical education in schools will remain the responsibility of the Ministry. The Technical Education Department, with all its functions taken over, will then be dissolved.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is essentially a straightforward Bill. Its main purpose has already been outlined in the Explanatory\n\nStatement, and I do not wish to go into the details again.\n\nWhile industrial training is primarily the responsibility of industry, it is imperative to ensure that national interests are served. A major function of the Board will be to encourage industry to play its proper role in the national industrial training effort.\n\nIt is envisaged that the future pattern of industrial training to be promoted by the Industrial Training Board will be as follows: -\n\n(1) The training of operatives and artisans will gradually be transferred back to industry.\n\n(2) On the other hand, the further development of the necessary training capacity for the required output of skilled manpower, both institutionally and within industry, will be a major preoccupation of the Board.\n\n(3) The Board will increase the supply of persons institutionally trained up to Trade Certificate and Industrial Technician Certificate levels.\n\n(4) The further skill-development of the basic-trained worker will be accomplished by the employer with the help of the Board through on-the-job training and, wherever possible, within the framework of an apprenticeship training scheme.\n\n(5) The emphasis in industrial training will be placed on the attainment of recognised standards. The Government envisages that the Industrial Training Board will develop a national system of trade testing. This will not only improve the quality of training but also establish uniformity of standards within the work-force.\n\n(6) The upgrading of adult skilled workers will be progressively achieved through programmes of off-the-job Industrial Training (OJIT), based on the module system already introduced.\n\n(7) To cater for the smaller industries, group training schemes, encompassing both apprenticeship training and OJIT, will be developed for the upgrading of key personnel, and finally,\n\n(8) The promotion of apprenticeship training itself will be a primary concern of the Board.\n\nIt will be apparent, from what I have just outlined, that apprenticeship schemes will feature increasingly in industrial training. The Government is giving consideration to introducing legislation to promote and regulate apprenticeship training at some future date. The Government will look forward to the views and recommendations of the Industrial Training Board, when formed, on the detailed provisions that will be necessary. It is anticipated that the legislation will cover the definition of apprenticeable trades, the forms and conduct of the training to be undertaken, and the responsibilities of both employer and apprentice, including the period of indenture. The Industrial Training Board will then become the chief agency for the implementation of apprenticeship training.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n3.08 p.m.\n\nMr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to inquire from the Minister for Education as to when will the Industrial Training Board be actually set up, now that the Bill is being read a Second and Third time. What are the present educational institutions that will be taken over by the Industrial Training Board? Will they be only the vocational institutes? Will they include the technical schools, the centralised workshops, and so on? What categories of teachers will be given the opportunity to exercise their option to he employed by the Industrial Training Board, and whether the terms and conditions of service will be as favourable, if not, more favourable than what they are at present?\n\nIn respect of clause 19 (h) of the Bill which states that the Industrial Training Board can carry on any trade or business, I would like to request the Minister for Education to elaborate on what trade or business that he envisages the Industrial Training Board will carry\n\nout. Will this affect the training programme of the educational institutions? There is also a provision in clause 39 which makes it compulsory for apprentices who undergo training to be insured. I would like to know whether consideration is also given to teachers to be insured also.\n\nThere is provision for teachers to exercise the option as to whether or not they want to remain in the Government service or to be opted in to the Industrial Training Board. In this respect can the Minister for Education ensure that a reasonable period will be given to the teachers to exercise the option, so that they can have a clearer picture of what their future will be when they opt? As at present, they are still vague about their working conditions.\n\n3.12 p.m.\n\nMr J. F. Conceicao (Katong): Mr Speaker, Sir, may I heartily commend the Government on the introduction of this Bill. I have no doubts that the effect of the establishment of a properly administered Industrial Training Board will be a vastly improved co-ordination of all industrial training which at present seems to be in a relatively fragmented state. It can also be expected that industrial training facilities will be improved and extended. It is significant that research and assistance in research will feature as a function of the Industrial Training Board. Thus, Sir, we can expect a more systematic and rational relationship between training and the industrial training needs that can result from a better understanding of training problems.\n\nWe have been told that there will be a determination of common standards to be attained in different industrial skills and a common method of ascertaining whether these standards have indeed been attained. The problem that arises is how to encourage industries, especially the small ones to which the Minister has already made reference, to organise training for their own apprentices up to the standard set by the Industrial\n\nTraining Board, or to see to the building of the skills of employees in small industries. Obviously, incentives will have to be provided. It is only realistic to conclude that many enterprises will have to be induced to take advantage of the apprenticeship training provisions, although the better the skills of the workers, the better the chances of an enterprise succeeding. Of course, the beneficiary will be the industry itself.\n\nThis reminds me of the problem that we are having over quality control. It is no use pointing out that quality control makes for profitability. There has to be a demonstration effect. Incentives have to be offered. In the case of the Industrial Training Board, in as much as there has been talk of payroll tax being used to support apprenticeship and industrial training, I would support such a measure. Indeed, perhaps an additional eventual measure will have to be provided, as what the Minister has already referred to, namely, the passage of an apprenticeship training act which will make it compulsory for industries to provide training according to schedules, schemes and conditions laid down by the Industrial Training Board.\n\nApparently, the Industrial Training Board will have to work out the manner in which those industries which already have general training may be able to contribute to industrial training. A careful judicious blend of a joint effort between the Government and industry will result both in the industries themselves benefiting, as well as our industrial growth receiving the good effects of such co-operation.\n\nThere are one or two other matters in the Bill which I would like to refer to, Mr Speaker, Sir. One of them is the composition of the members of the Board. I wonder what sort of people will be appointed to the Board. I would like to recommend that there should be one adult educator on the Board. The Ministry of Education is well acquainted with the people within its own ranks.\n\nThe other point which I am rather curious about is the hint in clause 5, which says that:\n\n`There shall be paid to the Chairman, Deputy Chairman and other members of the Board out of the funds of the Board such salaries, fees and allowances as the Minister may, from time to time, determine.'\n\nThere seems to be a precedent already where this is concerned where a member of a Board is given a full salary. I would imagine that one has to determine that the job he does will be commensurate with the full salary that he receives. After all, there is already a Director on this Board, and it is stated that he is the Chief Executive Officer, so we would like to ensure that there is no duplication of authority and, of course, of salary.\n\nAnother point which I would like to refer to relates to clause 19 which, I think the Member for Moulmein has already referred to, concerns the carrying on of trade or business by the Industrial Training Board. Presumably it is something like what is being done in the Catering School, in which case there is, at the same time, business as well as training. I find it difficult to imagine that this can be applied in any other instance. But I would like some clarification from the Minister.\n\nWith regard to clause 34 (1), Sir, it reads:\n\n`The Minister shall nominate in each year the Auditor-General or a company auditorto audit the accounts of the Board.'\n\nI would strongly urge that if the Auditor-General is not nominated, a company auditor should be nominated on the advice of the Auditor-General, who should also give the terms and conditions on the basis of which the audit should be carried out.\n\nFinally, I would like to ask a question in relation to a point which has already been brought up, which is that the Board will require persons who attend courses to be insured against personal injury and loss of life. Who is going to pay for this insurance, Mr Speaker, Sir?\n\n3.20 p.m.\n\nDr Lee Chiaw Meng: Mr Speaker, Sir, to answer the first question raised by the Member for Moulmein, we\n\nwould like to establish the Industrial Training Board as soon as possible after the Bill becomes an Act. Much depends on the various processes we have to go through. The Member also asked which institutions will come under the jurisdiction of the Board. The institutions which will be transferred to the Board will include mainly those which are involved with industrial training. These are all the vocational institutes, the Singapore Technical Institute, the Hotel and Catering Training School. The Centralised Workshop and the technical schools, as I said earlier, will remain the responsibility of the Ministry.\n\nWith regard to the staff of the institutions, they will be given the option whether to remain in Government service or to join the Board, and a reasonable period will be given to them to make their options.\n\nOn the rather interesting query about carrying on of trade or business, I think the Member for Katong has already answered the question partly. In carrying out training, there are certain products which are marketable and certain services which are also marketable. It is therefore necessary for the Board to engage in trade or business so as to dispose of these marketable products and services to bring in revenue. At the same time it serves as a sales promotion of the skills of our graduates.\n\nSir, it is not the practice of a statutory board to have their staff insured. I guess the best way is for the staff - I believe the Member for Moulmein will expect this from me -to take up INCOME policies themselves.\n\nThe Member for Katong touched on the question of encouraging small industries to participate in group training schemes. We have some measure of success with the SASAR group, i.e, the Singapore Association of Shipbuilders and Repairers. For these industries, we provide further education. We organise the courses to provide a uniform training syllabus and curriculum\n\nfor the workers. We provide the facilities and teaching staff for the further education component and the industries provide on-the-job training. We also provide expert advice on what training should be done in their industries. We also give certain incentives to encourage people to take on apprenticeship training. There are certain financial allowances to be given to any industry which takes on demobbed national servicemen for training in certain critical trades, especially the precision trade.\n\nThe Member for Katong also raised a very interesting point about appointing an adult educator on the Board. Let me assure him that only the best people who can make a contribution will be appointed to the Board. It is with this purpose in mind that we have made a provision in the Bill to pay an allowance to the Chairman and the other members of the Board.\n\nI agree with him entirely that if the Auditor-General is not nominated to audit the accounts of the Board, then we will take the advice of the Auditor-General on who should be the best to carry out that function.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Dr Lee Chiaw Meng].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. NATIONAL CADET CORPS BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.28 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, the Cadet Corps movement in Singapore was founded in 1902 when the first Army Cadet Corps units were formed in Raffles Institution. It was\n\nonly after the Second World War that the movement gained momentum. In 1947, Army Cadet Corps units were resuscitated; in 1948 the Sea Cadet Corps was formed, followed in 1949 by the formation of the Air Training Corps. Each of these organisations functioned independently of the other. With independence in 1965, the need to inculcate the youth of the Republic with a sense of patriotism and to develop in them ruggedness of mind and body and leadership qualities became imperative. It was considered that an effective way of bringing this about lay in the training provided by the uniformed movement in the schools. An expansion programme of the Cadet Corps movement was therefore embarked upon in 1965. The combined membership of the three Cadet Corps then stood at just over 1,500 with 24 schools participating. Today, the strength of the Cadet Corps has risen to over 14,000 members (9,000 boys and 5,000 girls) with 102 out of 113 secondary schools participating. Next year, the Cadet Corps membership is expected to reach 18,000.\n\nMembership in the Cadet Corps extends from Secondary I to Pre-University I students. It is no exaggeration to say that many of our top Singapore Armed Forces personnel once served as cadets when they were in school. I am informed that cadets, on becoming national servicemen, have acquitted themselves well, setting high standards in discipline, bearing, turnout and performances. That the Cadet Corps provides sound pre-national service training is no modest claim.\n\nWith increasing numbers of students wishing to join the Cadet Corps, at one time the movement was faced with the difficulty of training sufficient numbers of officers to meet new demands and to replace those leaving the Corps on promotion, transfers, secondment, study leave and resignations. However, the problem is gradually being overcome with the introduction of cadet training at the Teachers Training College. Last June, 36 TTC trainees graduated as qualified teachers as well as trained\n\ncadet officers. Currently, there are 99 final year TTC students undergoing cadet training. Steps are being taken to relieve the shortage of officers in the Cadet Corps through the appointments of SAF reservists who are teachers. Attention is paid to Pre-U I students who are given advanced training for appointment as Cadet Lieutenants.\n\nThe expansion of the Cadet Corps movement necessitated a complete review of the Cadet Corps organisation as a whole. Hence on 1st January, 1969, the National Cadet Corps was formed by the integration of the Army, Sea and Air Cadet Corps to strengthen the administration of the Cadet Corps movement and to raise the level of training of all cadets in schools. This move ensures that the best use is made of manpower, buildings, training areas and facilities and of other logistical requirements, resulting in maximum utilisation of available resources. With this integration, new legislation has to be promulgated to replace the existing Acts and Regulations which govern the Army, Sea and Air Cadet Corps separately. Hence the introduction of the National Cadet Corps Bill. In passing, I would like to mention that the Police Cadet Corps does not form part of the National Cadet Corps. It remains under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs. However, steps are being taken to update the Police Cadet Corps Act and the Police Cadet Corps Regulations to bring them in line with the main provisions of the National Cadet Corps Act and Regulations.\n\nWith the enactment of the National Cadet Corps Bill, the Cadet Corps will be accorded the status befitting the role it is playing in training our youth to become loyal and responsible citizens as part of our effort to build an organised and disciplined society.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Lee Chiaw Meng].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\n\nORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION (Exemption of Notice) FIRE AT ROBINSON DEPARTMENTAL STORE\n\n3.35 p.m.\n\nMr Speaker: The hon. Member for Serangoon Gardens wishes to ask a question without notice, as provided for under Standing Order No. 19. I have considered it and am of the opinion that it is of an urgent character. I have therefore given him permission to ask the question.\n\nMr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens): Mr Speaker, Sir, today we all know of the tragic fire which broke out at the Robinson departmental store at Raffles Place. In view of the magnitude of the fire and the number of lives it has claimed, I regard this as a matter of public importance and sufficiently urgent to merit a voice in this House, for which I am grateful to you, Sir.\n\nMy question is simply to ask the Minister for Social Affairs if he would inform this House of (i) the tragic outcome of the fire which broke out yesterday in the Robinson departmental store, and (ii) any other details which he may now have in his possession.\n\nThe Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok): Mr Speaker, Sir, at 1006 hours yesterday, the Fire Brigade Control Room received a telephone call that an electrical short circuit had occurred in the Robinson departmental store at Raffles Place. This was followed by a series of calls from members of the public. The Fire Brigade immediately responded to the fire call. The officer, on arrival at 1013 hours, immediately radioed the Fire Control Room that Robinson's was smoke-lodged and requested for an\n\nadditional pump. The fire, fanned by a steady breeze, rapidly worsened due to the highly combustible stocks and structures of the building. Reinforcements of men and fire engines were sent to the scene immediately. The fire at this stage had already obtained a very strong hold and spread rapidly throughout the entire building. At the height of the fire, 14 fire engines and some 90 officers and men were engaged in fire operations. A total of nine hand-controlled branches and three twin branches were brought to bear on the fire. The Brigade is still engaged in damping-down operations at this very moment.\n\nAs a result of the fire the building and contents of Robinson's were completely destroyed, and the upper floor of adjoining and adjacent premises was affected by the heat and flames. The Assistant Director, Building Control Division, was contacted and was requested to inspect the beams and columns and to advise the Brigade of their stability. Following a preliminary inspection and assessment, the Brigade was advised that the structures were not stable, and it was therefore inadvisable to begin digging operations.\n\nThe lift-car nearest Messrs Bengold was forced open last night, but no one was found inside. The passenger lift-cars located at the rear of the premises had collapsed during the fire. However, Sir, I have just been informed that at 2.00 p.m. this afternoon four skeletons were found at the fire site. There was another lift-car in the basement, which is still unopened because the basement is flooded with water. We do not as yet know whether it is empty or not.\n\nThe PSA Fire Brigade assisted the Singapore Fire Brigade with manpower and pumping units at the height of this blaze. I would like to inform the House, Sir, that members of the Singapore Fire Brigade and members of the PSA Fire Brigade did a splendid job in not only controlling the fire but also in preventing it from spreading to the adjacent buildings.\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin: Mr Speaker, Sir, without making any attempt to prejudge the cause of the fire, at this juncture there are two suggestions I would like to put forward to the Minister. (1) Will the Minister consider requiring all owners of old buildings, frequented by members of the public, to be regularly inspected by competent electrical engineers with particular attention to the electrical wiring? (2) At present there does not seem to be much control over the manner in which old buildings can be renovated. In many instances, the interior has been renovated to an extent that no adequate fire exits are provided. Therefore, I do not know whether the Fire Brigade can make rules requiring owners of old buildings wishing to renovate to apply for their permission, so that the Fire Brigade could ensure that adequate fire exits are provided. This is one aspect worth looking into.\n\nEncik Othman Bin Wok: Sir, in fact, this matter was immediately discussed by my officers yesterday. The outcome of the discussion will be made known soon.\n\nDr Tan Eng Liang: Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister for Social Affairs consider establishing some co-ordination between the Fire Brigade and the PUB, for example, to ensure that sufficient water pressure is given in all outbreaks of fire?\n\nEncik Othman Bin Wok: Sir, there is always co-ordination between the Fire Brigade and the PUB. Yesterday, at the height of the blaze, the PUB directed water pressure in full to the affected areas.ADJOURNMENT: Resolved,\n\n\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\"-[Mr Barker].\n\nAdjourned accordingly at Sixteen minutes to Four o'clock p.m. to a date to be fixed.", "url": "https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/#/report?sittingdate=22-11-1972"}
