PETITION\n\nMr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have the privilege to present a petition to this House. The petition asks the House to declare its privileges and, particularly, the question whether any proceeding before the House or a Committee can be questioned outside the House.\n\nThe petition is from one Mr Sivadas s/o Sankaran who resides at No. 7, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh #02-245. The petition, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, relates to an action brought by nine persons against Mr Sivadas s/o Sankaran in respect of a memorandum that Mr Sivadas submitted to a Committee of this House. That Committee was the Select Committee appointed to consider the Companies (Amendment) Bill. Arising out of his representation to that Committee, he was subsequently sued in the High Court in respect of his representation made to the Select Committee. Mr Sivadas now asks this House to declare its privileges in respect of proceedings in the House and, particularly, whether his proceeding, and submission of a memorandum is a proceeding in the\n\nHouse, can be questioned elsewhere outside this House. Those, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, are briefly the material allegations in the petition.\n\nI will now, as required by Standing Order 17, read the prayer of the petition. It is signed by Mr Sivadas, and perhaps I should have said that the Clerk has certified that it is in accordance with paragraph (5) of Standing Order 17 which deals with petitions. The prayer of the petition is this, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir:\n\n'By this petition I humbly pray that:\n\n(1) The legal proceedings commenced against me in Suit No. 5888 of 1984 in the form of a defamation action arising from my taking part in a Parliamentary proceeding be declared a breach of the privileges of Parliament.\n\n(2) Times Publishing Berhad and the Straits Times Press (1975) Limited, and their Board of Directors and their Solicitors Godwin and Co. be punished under SeCtion 20 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act Cap. 49.'\n\nThe directors of the companies mentioned are Mr Sellappan Ramanathan of 122 Ceylon Road, Mr Tan Chye Cheng of 7C Balmoral Road, Mr Lyndley John Holloway of 42 Nassim Road, Mr Michael Y. 0. Fam of 36 Fifth Avenue, Mr Tang I-Fang of 20 Jalan Merbok, Mr Benoy Kumar Sen of 23 Cluny Hill and, finally, Mr Peter Lim Heng Loong of 81 Tiong Poh Road #03-53.\n\nMay I now hand the petition to the Clerk.\n\nTo lie upon the Table. ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS: Mr Deputy Speaker: Questions 1 and 2, addressed to the Prime Minister, will be taken at 2.30 pm, pursuant to the resolution of the House of 4th March, 1985. Mr Ng Kah Ting. FIRST OPEN MOBILIZATION EXERCISE (Report)\n\n3. Mr Ng Kah Ting asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (a) whether the first Open Mobilization exercise was a success; (b) what were the shortcomings encountered and how does his Ministry propose to overcome them; (c) whether reservists will be allowed to keep a set of uniforms with them all the time; and (d) what steps his Ministry plans to take to improve on such exercises in regard to reducing the time taken to report to camp.\n\nThe Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, assessed against the objectives, the Open Mobilization exercise was a success.\n\nIts first objective was to test the use of codewords. The second was to evaluate the system of activating units through radio, television, Rediffusion and cinema announcements. The third was to assess how well the mobilization centres could receive and manage reservists reporting at a fast pace, and how accurately and speedily they could report the progress to higher levels. The last objective was to have reservists and members of the public understand the Open Mobilization system, and know the part each has to play.\n\nAll systems functioned smoothly. The reservists were highly motivated and supportive. Many reported early, even though they were working the night shift or attending night classes. More than 90% had reported within four hours, and 97% responded by the six-hour deadline. It testifies to the fine spirit of the reservists, their families, their employers and the public.\n\nNo significant shortcomings were encountered, but some details have to be\n\nimproved. For example, the announcements of the Open Mobilization over television and radio should be made more frequently. Also some mobilization centres, such as schools, did not have enough telephone lines and other facilities. Mindef will remedy these problems before the next exercise.\n\nThe main drawback of the exercise on the 8th July was that, with the pre-warning and the publicity, some realism had to be sacrificed. This was recognized even at the planning stage. But for the first exercise, it could not be helped. Some future exercises will be conducted without advance notice to test this aspect of the system.\n\nAs for allowing reservists to keep a set of uniforms with them all the time, it has been the SAF's practice for many years to issue each reservist two sets of combat uniforms.\n\nConcerning the time allowed for the reservists to report to camp, Mindef does not presently intend to change the six-hour limit. Within this limit, it is up to each reservist to report back to his unit as quickly as possible. However, the exercises will progressively become more demanding, Besides being conducted without advance notice, some exercises will go beyond reservists simply reporting back to camp. The reservists will also have to load up their stores and equipment and deploy their units in the field, as if for real operations. The aim, of course, is to field a fully ready fighting force in the shortest possible time.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, while it is very heartening to receive the report from the Hon. Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry on the success of the first Open Mobilization scheme, will future exercises be conducted in such a way as to test the full preparedness of our reservists?\n\nBG Lee Hsien Loong: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answer is yes. For the first exercise, it was necessary for us to give pre-warning and publicity because the public had to be made aware of the nature of the exercise and what was expected of them. Otherwise, there would have been alarm and confusion which would have been highly undesirable. However, it is\n\nimportant that reservists should know that mobilization, whether open or silent, can take place at any time, on any day or weekend. Therefore, for future exercises, we do intend to activate the system without giving advance notice, so that the reservists will not know beforehand that this is the evening when they must watch their television sets for the mobilization symbol.\n\nAlso, beyond coming back without notice, we will expect them to go not only to report but to equip themselves, to shake-out, to fall into battle order and to move out, and perhaps conduct a realistic exercise to verify that the whole system works. We will not do this with our entire order of battle, but we will do it with components, and we will do it regularly.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, will this be continually done so that it becomes a pan of the way of life of Singapore?\n\nBG Lee Hsien Loong: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, yes, it will be done regularly so that it becomes a part of our way of life. Silent mobilization has become a part of our way of life - we do it regularly and nobody takes any notice. In time, Open Mobilization will attain the same status.\n\nHDB FLAT OWNERS UPGRADING TO BIGGER FLATS (Levy on resale of flats)\n\n4. Mr S. Vasoo asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many existing 3-, 4- and 5-room Housing and Development Board flat owners have applied to upgrade to bigger flats; and (b) what is the rationale for not reducing the respective levy on resale of flats by owners upgrading to bigger HDB flats.\n\nThe Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as at 31 March 1985, 17,573 existing 3-, 4- and 5-room HDB flat owners have applied to upgrade to bigger flats.\n\nTo answer question (b), Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me first remind the House of the objective of the Government's\n\npublic housing programme. It is to provide decent homes for Singaporeans. The Government never intended HDB flats to be bought and sold purely for business gains. Thus, when resale of flats was first permitted, those who upgraded to bigger flats had to sell their first flats back to the HDB at the original selling prices. Nobody was allowed to profit from the resale of HDB flats. This policy was in force for 15 years from 1964 to 1979.\n\nWhen the policy was relaxed in August 1979 to allow HDB owners to re-sell their flats to buyers of their own choice, a cream-off rate of 5% was levied to prevent excessive profits. This rate, however, proved to be inadequate, resulting in excessive profiteering in some cases. A graded levy based on flat type was consequently imposed from September 1982. While the graded levy has been successful in curbing excessive profits, it has had the undesirable side-effect of preventing owners of bigger flats from upgrading to Executive and HUDC flats or moving into private housing. To correct this anomaly, the resale policy was recently revised by the HDB.\n\nThe revised policy is fair to all HDB and HUDC lessees. Owners of bigger flats will benefit from the revision as they can now pay 10% more for their second flats instead of paying a 20-30% levy on the resale price of their first flat. At the same time, owners of smaller flats who could previously pay a small levy of 10-15% of the resale price can continue to pay the same levy when they upgrade to bigger flats. This benefit is not taken away from them. In absolute terms, owners of smaller flats pay a smaller sum when upgrading to bigger flats as compared with owners of bigger flats. For example, a 3-room flat owner pays a levy of $3,000-$4,000 as against the $12,000-$15,000 premium a 5-room flat owner has to pay when both are upgrading to Executive flats. Owners of smaller flats therefore have not lost out after the revision.\n\nIn all policy revisions since 1979, there has been one underlying principle, that is, people are allowed to enjoy the full subsidy only once. This explains why flat owners who move into private housing are\n\npermitted to retain their profits, while those who buy a subsequent flat must pay either a levy on the first flat or a premium for the subsequent flat.\n\nIn reviewing the resale policy, the HDB had considered the possibility of reducing the rates of levy as suggested by the Member for Bo Wen. However, the revised policy just implemented was found to be the better one, in that lessees are allowed to choose the option that is more advantageous to them. Had the HDB decided to reduce rates, it is likely that only the rates for bigger flats would be decreased. No adjustment would have been made to the rates for smaller flats since the present levy for these flats is already small.\n\nDr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the Hon. Minister inform this House whether there have been cases of evasion of the levy by under-declaring the actual transaction price?\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Sir, I think the possibility is there but the HDB would not know.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Sir, would the Hon. Minister agree with me that this resale levy is really a capital gains tax? And since we have no capital gains tax in any other sector in the economy, this is an anomaly.\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Sir, I do not think so. This resale levy is not a capital gains tax. In fact, I have stated in my answer quite clearly that anybody who moves into private housing is allowed to retain all the profits. So there is no tax imposed on him. It is only when a flat owner asks for a second flat, which means that he is asking the Government to provide a second subsidy, then a levy or a premium is imposed.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Sir, would the Hon. Minister agree with me that when the resale levy was first imposed, it was really a response to what may be described as the \"politics of envy\"?\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Sir, not exactly because, as I have stated earlier, anybody who is not asking the HDB to provide a second flat will be allowed to retain all the profits.\n\nHDB HOUSING ESTATES (Rusty water problem)\n\n5. Mr Chew Heng Ching asked the Minister for National Development what progress the Housing and Development Board has made in drawing up the programme to combat the rusty water problem in existing HDB housing estates and when this programme will be made known to the public.\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Sir, the HDB has finalized the programme to replace all external galvanized iron distribution pipes in residential blocks built before 1982. Non-corrodible pipes have been used in apartment blocks built since 1982. The replacement programme, which affects 3,200 blocks and is estimated to cost $51.7 million, will be completed by December 1988. So far, nine contracts covering 829 blocks have been called and replacement works in 240 blocks have been completed.\n\nDetails of the replacement programme for the remaining 2,371 blocks will be announced by the HDB before the end of August 1985.\n\nHDB'S POLICY ON SEASON CAR PARK TICKETS (Review)\n\n6. Mr Chew Heng Ching asked the Minister for National Development whether the Housing and Development Board will review its policy on the allocation of seasonal car park tickets so as to accord a company registered car the same priority as the first owner registered car so long as it can be proven that the company car is the only or first car in the household.\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Sir, presently, season parking tickets are sold to residents according to the following priority:\n\n(a) First private vehicle registered in personal name of resident;\n\n(b) First company vehicle used by resident;\n\n(c) Second or third vehicles used by resident;\n\n(d) Others (eg, vehicles belonging to employees of shop tenants, etc).\n\nThe present system is a fair way of allocating the limited car parking space in HDB estates, ensuring that the first vehicle owned by an HDB household gets a season parking lot before others.\n\nHowever, the HDB will review the present allocation policy as part of its continuing efforts to improve car park operations and management in housing estates.\n\nSEMBAWANG ROAD/YISHUN AVENUE 5 (Pedestrian overhead bridge)\n\n7. Dr Koh Lip Lin asked the Minister for National Development whether there is any plan to construct a pedestrian overhead bridge across Sembawang Road near Yishun Avenue 5, Blocks 101 and 106, in view of the increasing number of residents crossing the road daily.\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Sir, there is no plan to construct a pedestrian overhead bridge across Sembawang Road near Yishun Avenue 5, Blocks 101 and 106, due to the narrowness of this stretch of road. Instead, the PWD will be installing a pedestrian signal crossing there. The work is expected to be completed by October 1985.\n\nHAWKER STALLS FOR RESETTLEMENT CASES (Filling of vacancies)\n\n8. Dr Koh Lam Son asked the Minister for National Development how many existing vacant stalls in Housing and Development Board hawker centres are reserved for resettlement cases; and what is the average time taken before a vacant stall is occupied.\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Sir, under the current Hawkers Policy formulated by the Hawkers Co-ordinating and Licensing Committee of the Ministry of the Environment, all vacant cooked food stalls are reserved for the resiting of licensed street hawkers and resettlement cases affected by public development schemes. There are at present 420 vacant cooked food stalls in HDB hawker centres.\n\nThe time taken for vacant stalls to be occupied varies considerably, depending on the pace of specific clearance programmes. On average, a vacant stall is occupied within six months.\n\nDr Koh Lam Son (Telok Blangah): Sir, for those stalls which have been repeatedly rejected by licensed street hawkers or resettlement cases, would the Hon. Minister consider releasing these stalls to other qualified applicants on the waiting list?\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Sir, the allocation of hawker stalls is under the Hawkers Co-ordinating and Licensing Committee of the Ministry of the Environment. So the hon. Member's request should be submitted to the Ministry of the Environment.\n\nTOA PAYOH NORTH/LORONG 1 (Alternative car parking facilities)\n\n9. Dr Ho Tat Kin asked the Minister for National Development what alternative car parking facilities are being planned for residents at Toa Payoh North and Lorong 1 where Mass Rapid Transit work has taken up much of the existing car park areas.\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Sir, two car parks at Toa Payoh North and Lorong 1 are affected by the MRT work, Of the 1,109 lots in these two car parks, only 92 lots are taken up by the MRT work. According to the HDB, there are sufficient car parking lots to meet the needs of residents. Nevertheless, the HDB is monitoring the sale of season tickets closely. If the existing parking lots prove to be insufficient, the Board will provide temporary parking facilities. The MRT work is expected to be completed by mid-1987 when the 92 affected lots will be restored for parking use.\n\nAPARTMENTS NEAR BEATTY SECONDARY SCHOOL (Car parking facilities)\n\n10. Dr Ho Tat Kin asked the Minister for National Development what parking facilities are being planned for the five new blocks of apartments which are being built next to Beatty Secondary School.\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Sir, the HDB is building 327 car parking lots and 44 motor-\n\ncycle lots for the five new blocks of apartments currently under construction at Lorong 6 Toa Payoh next to Beatty Secondary School. These parking facilities will be completed by the end of this year.\n\nDr Ho Tat Kin (Boon Teck): Sir, would the Minister please confirm that the parking facilities will be ready when the occupants move in?\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Sir, it is the usual practice of the HDB to get the facilities ready, including car park facilities, when the residents move in.\n\nPRIME MINISTER'S REMARKS ABOUT LEADERS OF THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES (Reactions)\n\n11. Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Community Development if any protest was received by the Government from any Third World country over the remarks of the Prime Minister about the leaders of Third World countries when speaking in this House on the 22nd of March 1985 in the debate on Ministers' salaries.\n\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Community Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan): Sir, during the debate referred to, the Prime Minister mentioned that Indian members of Parliament could nominate students to medical colleges. An official of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs called our High Commissioner in New Delhi and informed him that members of Parliament in India are not entitled to nominate students to medical colleges. We have taken note of this.\n\nMr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson): Sir, apart from this clarification from the Indian government, would the Minister say whether any protest was received from any other country?\n\nMr Dhanabalan: Sir, no other protest was received.\n\nFEEDBACK UNIT (Processing of complaints and suggestions)\n\n12. Mr Abdullah Tarmugi asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister\n\nfor Community Development (a) how many complaints and suggestions the Feedback Unit has received so far; (b) what are the nature of these complaints and suggestions; (c) how many suggestions have been accepted or considered; and (d) how many complaints have been resolved.\n\nThe Minister of State for Community Development and Communications and Information (Mr Wong Kan Seng) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Community Development): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as at 30th June 1985, the Feedback Unit received from members of the public a total of 229 letters. As many letters contained more than one point, it is more meaningful to talk in terms of the number of times a particular subject is raised. A total of 294 items were raised by the writers during the period. The distribution of the items by subject is as follows:\n\nSocial and Community Matters, eg, welfare services, Medisave, constitute 56 times, or 19% of the 294.\n\nLand Transport, eg, car ownership, public transport, 54 times or 18%.\n\nEconomic and Labour Matters, eg, the business climate, CPF, 54 times, or 18%.\n\nHousing, eg, HDB regulations, estate maintenance, 29 times or 10%.\n\nPolitical and Legislative Matters, eg, Parliamentary debates, 22 times or 8%.\n\nSecurity and Crime Matters, eg, Total Defence, unlawful activities, 16 times or 5%.\n\nOther Policy Matters, eg, developing patriotism, 23 times or 8%.\n\nAppeals, eg, hawker licences, 22 times or 8%.\n\nComplaints, eg, traffic summonses, poor service by Government departments, 18 times or 6%.\n\nThe subjects raised can be classified into three types. The first type consists of feedback on national policies, issues and problems. These form 86% of the total input that we received. This shows that people are fully aware of the objectives and the reasons why the Feedback Unit\n\nwas set up, ie, to process feedback on national issues, policies and problems with a view to resolving them.\n\nAll the suggestions have been or will be considered. They have to be carefully evaluated against the overall perspective and long-term implications. For example, feedback on the current state of the economy and suggestions on how to improve it are referred to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. But the analysis of all the suggestions take time. Both the Feedback Unit and the Ministries concerned will bear them in mind in their future policy deliberations. I hope that members of the public will continue to write to the Feedback Unit giving their suggestions.\n\nThe second type consists of appeals. These are from people whose applications for various things, such as hawker licences and work permits, have been turned down. The writers would like their cases to be reconsidered or be given special consideration. As I mentioned earlier, these cases only form 8% of the total input. All appeals are considered by the appropriate Ministries. Of the 22 appeals received so far, one was granted, three were given alternatives, seven were given explanations and the remaining 11 are still pending.\n\nThe third type consists of complaints. These are expressions of dissatisfaction against various Ministries and they form only 6% of the total. Of the 18 complaints received, five were resolved, eight were given explanations and the remaining five are still pending.\n\nAs hon. Members will see from the figures, our people are fully aware of the role of the Feedback Unit. They did not treat it as a complaints bureau and, in fact, they know exactly what the Unit is for and have responded accordingly.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question for the Minister of State. May I know about the comments on Government policies that are received by the Feedback Unit? I understood the Minister of State to say that they are evaluated by officials. The\n\nquestion is, what happens after the evaluation? Is there a discussion initiated with the persons who have submitted the proposals? Or does the Ministry merely write back and say, \"Well, we accept your proposals\" or \"We reject your proposals\"?\n\nMr Wong Kan Seng: All suggestions received by the Feedback Unit are discussed by a Supervisory Panel chaired by the hon. Member for Ayer Rajah. If they require further discussion with the individual writer, then steps are taken where the individual will be asked to discuss further on the subject. If the matter deserves further consideration, it will also be referred to the Ministry concerned where further discussions and deliberations take place.\n\nDr Augustine Tan (Whampoa): Sir, would the hon. Minister of State inform this House about the rate of flow of the suggestions or complaints to the Feedback Unit? In other words, I would expect that there was a great influx at the beginning and, maybe, tailing off. Is there such a phenomenon?\n\nMr Wong Kan Seng: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no such phenomenon. We have received a constant stream of suggestions from members of the public. For example, when we first announced the Feedback Unit in April, we received 57 letters, in May we received 88, in June we received 62. And before the formation of the Feedback Unit, we received 22 letters. So I think there has not been any significant change in the flow of suggestions to the Feedback Unit.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Sir, does the Ministry propose or have in mind any public discussion, not only just from the persons who sent in their comments, but public discussion on the comments or proposals submitted by any member of the public to the Feedback Unit?\n\nMr Wong Kan Seng: All suggestions received are classified in the order of frequency. And when we see that there is a significant issue to be discussed openly in public, we will definitely arrange for it.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Sir, would the hon. Minister of State consider a proposal to enable people who are illiterate to express\n\ntheir views in some way? Because these people cannot write letters and therefore they have no means of putting forward their suggestions. I am concerned particularly, Sir, about the bottom 15-20% of the population.\n\nMr Wong Kan Seng: I think there are many avenues for members of the public who could not write to the Feedback Unit to express or give their suggestions. These avenues are the respective RCs, CCCs or MCs or even the Members of Parliament. They can also phone in to the Feedback Unit, and we have received phone calls from members of the public regarding some of the suggestions.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Sir, I think my question was not answered. Would the Minister of State consider opening an avenue, that means, having letter writers made available to people who would like to write letters?\n\nMr Wong Kan Seng: There is no need for us to set up one desk, especially in Anson, to do the job of the Member of Parliament.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: That joke is lost on me, but it does not matter. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the Minister enlighten this House about the complaints? I asked about the comments on policies. What happens to these complaints? Are they investigated or are they merely given curt replies?\n\nMr Wong Kan Seng: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not sure if the hon. Member for Anson was listening when I was describing the process. I said that all suggestions received by the Feedback Unit from the members of the public are evaluated, considered by the Feedback Supervisory Panel and discussed with the Ministries concerned, and every point which they raised will be checked and counter-checked.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State perhaps does not understand my question. Where a member of the public makes a complaint about not being fairly treated by a Ministry official, or has been left out of something which he says he should receive, what does the Feedback Unit do? Does it investigate the man's case, the merits, and then order a review of the whole decision?\n\nMr Wong Kan Seng: That is precisely what the Feedback Unit was set up to do.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Does it?\n\nPUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD (Downward revision of tariffs)\n\n13. Dr Wang Kai Yuen asked the Minister for Trade and Industry and Minister for Education whether the utility rates of the Public Utilities Board will be revised downwards in view of the significant increases in the various PUB reserves and funds as given in the Balance Sheet in the Board's 1984 Annual Report.\n\nThe Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry and Minister for Education): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question assumes that because PUB's reserves have increased, PUB can reduce its utility rates. This assumption is incorrect. The increased reserves do not represent accumulated profits. PUB has two main reserve funds, the \"General Reserve\" and the \"Other Reserve\". These reserves are generated for specific purposes, The General Reserve, which stood at $88 million as at the end of 1984, was used as working capital for PUB. The Other Reserve of $120 million is used to finance the fuel stocks held by PUB.\n\nPUB has to collect enough revenue to break even. It must not only meet its operating expenses, but must also finance part of its development expenditure. In the last decade, PUB has been able to finance only 55% of its development expenditure. It had to borrow the balance from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, among other sources. On these loans, it had to pay market interest rates. To remain creditworthy, PUB must stay solvent.\n\nTo understand PUB's financial position more clearly, we should look at its Revenue Account rather than its Balance Sheet. In 1984, PUB collected $1.7 billion in revenue and paid $1.5 billion in operating expenses, leaving a gross operating surplus of $215 million. Out of this operating surplus, it had to pay non-operating expenses of $44 million, loan repayments\n\nof $141 million, and development expenditures of $21 million, leaving a balance of net income of only $8 million. The figures do not quite add up because of rounding. This $8 million represents a margin of less than 0.5% of the total revenue of $1.7 billion. With this negligible margin, it is clear that, unless there is a further drop in the price of fuel oil, there is no basis for the PUB to reduce its tariffs.\n\nTAXIS AND TAXI-DRIVERS (Situation report)\n\n14. Mr Abdullah Tarmugi asked the Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Defence what is the latest situation on taxis and taxi-drivers with regard to (i) taxi-drivers' earnings; (ii) commuters' complaints; and (iii) the number of taxis on the road.\n\nThe Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Defence (Dr Yeo Ning Hong): Sir, surveys by ROV, NTUC Comfort and taxi companies of some 600 single-shift and 1,400 two-shift taxis for the month of June 1985 showed that taxi drivers were earning more than before the fare adjustments in April. Taxis driven for one shift showed an average increase in fare collection of more than $180 a month; while taxis driven for two shifts showed an average increase of more than $360 a month.\n\nROV received a total of 76 complaints in June 1985. This is 32% less than the monthly average of 112 complaints over the last year.\n\nThere are about 11,200 taxis on the road. The total number of taxi licences issued by ROV remains the same as at last year, at about 11,600. The Ministry has no intention of reducing this number.\n\nMr Abdullah Tarmugi (Siglap): Can the hon. Minister tell us the nature of these complaints, please?\n\nDr Yeo Ning Hong: Sir, the complaints varied from misconduct to over-charging, to refusal to let out taxis, to failure on the part of taxi drivers to use meters, and so forth. There is not any one fixed category.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Is the Hon. Minister aware of the continuing anxiety on the part of taxi drivers about the impending increase in diesel tax?\n\nDr Yeo Ning Hong: Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the Minister tell us how many hours does a shift comprise in the calculation of the Registry of Vehicles?\n\nDr Yeo Ning Hong: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no fixed number of hours per shift. When taxi drivers bring their taxis in to have their meters read, they will indicate whether they are driving on one shift or two shifts.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Is the Minister aware that taxi drivers have to drive far longer hours to earn what they were earning before the 1st April?\n\nDr Yeo Ning Hong: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the data available to the ROV and the taxi companies do not support that hypothesis.\n\nMr Tang See Chim (Chua Chu Kang): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Minister is aware of the anxiety of the taxi drivers over the diesel tax, what is he going to do about it?\n\nDr Yeo Ning Hong: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have mentioned in the House previously that we will monitor the situation and closer to October we will have an overall picture, and then make a final decision.\n\nMr Tang See Chim: Sir, is he not aware that with this anxiety hanging over the heads of taxi drivers it is really not fair for him to take his own sweet time?\n\nDr Yeo Ning Hong: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since April the collection of taxi drivers has been improving. The situation has not stabilized. New fares were introduced in June, and that was only about a month ago. Therefore, we would like to be in a position where more data are available before a final decision is taken.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: The question, Sir, is whether the Hon. Minister is prepared to be flexible, should the situation turn out to\n\nbe such as not to enable the taxi drivers to pay all the tax that he wants to receive.\n\nDr Yeo Ning Hong: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance who is responsible for this has indicated that he will be flexible.\n\nROBBERY AND HOMICIDE (Figures)\n\n15. Dr Toh Chin Chye asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law what is the number of (i) robberies, and (ii) homicide cases for the periods January-June and July-December 1984 and January-June 1985.\n\nThe Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a total of 1,620 robberies were reported to the Police in 1984 - 797 in the first half of 1984 and 823 in the second half of 1984. In the first half of 1985, 770 robberies were reported, a decrease of 27 cases as compared to the first half of 1984 and a decrease of 53 cases as compared to the second half of 1984.\n\nAs for homicide cases, Sir, a total of 64 murders were reported in 1984 - 31 in the first half of 1984 and 33 in the second half of 1984. In the first half of this year, Sir, there were 31 murder cases.\n\nSINGAPORE POOLS (PTE) LTD (Agency licences for 4-digit puntings)\n\n16. Mr S. Vasoo asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health (a) what are the pressing reasons for the move by Singapore Pools (Pte) Ltd to offer licences for agents to operate 4-digit puntings; (b) whether the social ramifications of such a decision had been considered; and (c) whether such a move contradicts the overall Government policy of promoting better moral values of our citizens.\n\nThe Minister for Finance and Minister for Health (Dr Hu Tsu Tau): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Singapore Pools plans to introduce an on-line computerized electronic terminal system which will eventually replace its current manual system.\n\nThe on-line computerized system will be used initially for Toto only. At a later date,\n\nits use will be extended to include the 4-digit numbers game. This will take into account the need to prevent proliferation of betting systems.\n\nOperation of the computerized system is simple but requires the use of telephone lines. Singapore Pools therefore intends to locate the electronic terminals within the premises of shops located in the vicinity of its current sales booths and to have the terminals operated by agents on a part-time basis. This will allow the phasing out of the manual sales booths, Present plans are to install 150 terminals which will displace the existing 169 sales points.\n\nThe decision to computerize the Toto and 4-digit games implies no significant change in Government's policy towards gambling. Government recognizes that the urge to have a flutter, whether it be Toto, 4-digit, or horse-racing, cannot be totally eliminated from human nature. Far better that some controlled legal outlets be provided than to allow the urge to be satisfied by illegal operators. The proposed 150 electronic terminals will allow adequate access for those who wish to play the games. Care will be exercised to ensure that the terminals are not located in areas frequented by children and the gaming facilities will not be actively promoted.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Sir, would the Hon. Minister agree with me that this introduction of what may be called \"electronic vice\" will lead, among other things, to (a) financial ruin of many families; (b) erosion of work ethics in Singapore; and (c) the encouragement of speculative as opposed to productive investments?\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not believe that the introduction of an electronic terminal system adds to the vices, as the Member has said, to what it is now. It is merely a replacement of the existing system.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what moral right does the Government have to profit from gambling when it denies private individuals the right to profit from gambling?\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: It only denies illegal profits.\n\nMr Chng Hee Kok (Radin Mas): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a question for the Hon. Minister. If the majority of residents in a general survey indicate that they are not in favour of betting agents being located in their constituencies, will the wishes of these residents be respected?\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Pools would certainly take into account the wishes of the residents in any area. But it all depends on what the Member means by \"the majority of residents\". The intention is, in fact, to locate the terminals in the vicinity of booths which currently exist and which have been in place for some time and therefore should be near areas which are not socially disruptive and have, in fact, been accepted by the residents.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the Hon. Minister consider the views of Members of Parliament? And if any Member of Parliament were to object, would these devices be introduced?\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Sir, we would naturally accept the advice of Members of Parliament. However, I think it would have to be on the basis of the majority of Parliament.\n\nDr Aline K. Wong (Changkat): Two supplementary questions, Sir. Arising from the Member for Whampoa's inquiry about acceptance of the views of Members of Parliament, would the Minister not think that it is time also to review the exemption given to Singapore Pools from having to ask permission from the Government to embark on games of this nature?\n\nSecondly, would the Minister not also think that if the Government earmarks revenue that it would gather from Singapore Pools from this operation for specific social welfare projects, then the public at least should see some direct benefits to be derived from having a Government-owned company run this operation?\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the present law allows Singapore Pools a wide discretion to introduce various forms of gambling devices. But naturally I do not believe that they would proceed without consulting the Government on this. As far as the law is concerned, we intend to take a look at the implications for the future. REVISION OF PENSIONS: 17. Mr Ng Kah Ting asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health whether he is ready to announce the revision of the pensions of Government pensioners.\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a review of the Singapore Allowance is being finalized and an announcement will be made thereafter.\n\nI would like to reiterate that it is the Singapore Allowance which is being reviewed and not the pension terms. Pensions are payments for past services and are not subject to periodic review. The Singapore Allowance was introduced in 1974 as an ex-gratia payment to help pensioners adjust to the abnormally high inflation which followed the first oil shock in 1973. It was last revised in April 1982.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the Hon. Minister for Finance and Minister for Health kindly consider disclosing to this House the review of pensions, whether it is a right or as a form of Singapore Allowance, as soon as possible?\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: The suggestion is accepted. TAX CREDIT ON OVERESTIMATED PUB BILLS: 18. Dr Toh Chin Chye asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health whether Government tax on overestimated Public Utilities Board bills will be credited to consumer accounts.\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, tax is payable on monthly PUB bills above $80. For domestic consumers, the sanitary appliance fee and refuse charges are excluded from the tax.\n\nWhen the meters are not read, the PUB bills are estimated. The tax is subsequently adjusted when meter readings are obtained, and the Government tax on overestimated PUB bills credited to consumers' accounts.\n\nGovernment tax is not payable on all fixed charges, either for domestic or non-domestic accounts. Examples, besides appliance fee and sanitary charges, are\n\nfees charged for pink notices for late payments, re-connection of supply, second test of meter and special meter readings. Prior to November 1977, tax adjustments were calculated manually. As from November 1977, the computer automatically adjusts the tax on accounts which do not involve more than eight months of stored information. For other cases, manual adjustments are necessary.\n\nDr Toh Chin Chye (Rochore): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not sure whether the Minister for Finance has been reading his own PUB bills. But I have been studying my bills and I can assure the Minister that, whereas the PUB would credit over-estimates to actual readings, on the other hand, Government tax has never been credited at all. It remains on the estimated bill.\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Rochore would let me have his bill, we will look into this.\n\nDr Toh Chin Chye: Sir, it is wrong for me to raise this question solely on my own interest. I am asking this question on behalf of the consumers in Singapore.\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Sir, the response really is to find a natural case we can investigate.\n\nDr Toh Chin Chye: I accept the suggestion given by the Minister. LEVY ON SINGAPORE VEHICLES ENTERING SINGAPORE: 19. Dr Toh Chin Chye asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health whether it is the intention of the Government to impose a levy on motorists or vehicles that enter Singapore at Woodlands.\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I assume that the Member for Rochore is referring to press reports on measures which might be introduced to discourage Singapore motorists from buying petrol in Johore Bahru. These reports remain pure speculation.\n\nJudging from the rise in causeway traffic, there has undoubtedly been an increase in motorists visiting Johore Bahru just to buy petrol. Government is monitoring the situation in order to assess\n\nthe size of the increase and whether it is a temporary or a permanent trend.\n\nDr Toh Chin Chye: Sir, I am glad that-the Minister for Finance has laid put to rumours that have been published in the newspapers. If the Minister had earlier come out with a statement, I think great unease -\n\nMr Deputy Speaker: Dr Toh, could you frame your supplementary question?\n\nDr Toh Chin Chye: May I ask the Minister, as a corollary, whether he will impose an exit tax?\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Sir, the present intention is not to impose anything because we are still studying the situation.\n\nCASHLESS SOCIETY (Savings on printing and handling of currency notes)\n\n20. Dr Wang Kai Yuen asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health what is the amount of annual expenditure on printing and handling of currency notes that the Board of Commissioners of Currency expects to save if the nation goes cashless and whether such potential savings can be used to promote the cashless society.\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the cost of printing the new currency notes issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency in 1984 was about $5.5 million.\n\nCash, in the form of currency notes and coins, will always be required for some transactions. The progressive conversion to cashless transactions will probably have only a marginal impact on the current operations of the Board, although it will undoubtedly lower the growth in demand for currency notes in the future. Most of the immediate advantages of cashless transactions will accrue directly to those organizations, firms, etc. which are paying salaries in cash, collecting cash and accounting for cash.\n\nThe Government is already promoting cashless transactions as part of the productivity movement. A committee chaired by the Head of the Civil Service was established in January 1984 to find measures to minimize cash transactions in both the public and private sectors.\n\nANG MO KIO POLYCLINIC (Dental and psychiatric treatment)\n\n21. Mr S. Vasoo asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health (a) whether out-patient dental treatment will be provided in the Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic to meet the growing demand for dental needs of the residents living in Ang Mo Kio New Town; and (b) whether outpatient psychiatric treatment will also be available in the Polyclinic in the near future.\n\nThe Minister of State for Health and Foreign Affairs (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong) (for the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has no plan to set up an outpatient dental clinic within the Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic. This is because the dental clinic at Toa Payoh Hospital and the outpatient dental clinic at Jalan Kayu Polyclinic can also cater to residents of Ang Mo Kio. Also, those who want and can afford a more personalized service can have a choice of treatment from at least 10 private dental clinics presently operating in Ang Mo Kio New Town.\n\nThe Ministry does not intend to extend outpatient psychiatric treatment to the Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic in the near future. There is no need for this since the Specialist Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic at Woodbridge Hospital and the two Psychiatric Outpatient Clinics at the Lim Ah Pin Polyclinic and Pegu Road Outpatient Dispensary are within reasonable reach of Ang Mo Kio residents.\n\nREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO THE SENTOSA CABLE CAR ACCIDENT (Statement by the Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Defence)\n\n12.00 noon\n\nDr Yeo Ning Hong: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Members will recall that on the fateful day of 29 January 1983, a drillship named \"Eniwetok\" collided with the cableway carrying cable cars between Sentosa and the main island of Singapore. Seven cable car passengers lost their lives in the\n\naccident. Fourteen other passengers were rescued.\n\nImmediately after the accident, the President appointed a Commission of Inquiry to inquire into the circumstances leading to and determine the cause of the accident. The Commission was also asked:\n\n(a) to examine the current regulations on the use of waters and facilities along the channel between Sentosa Island and the main island of Singapore and to make recommendations for any amendments; and\n\n(b) to make recommendations for such appropriate safety measures which can be taken in order to prevent a similar occurrence.\n\nSir, the Commission submitted a report of its findings and recommendations to the President on 30 December 1983.\n\nMINISTRY'S COMMITTEE\n\nFollowing the Commission's Report, the Ministry of Communications set up a committee in January 1984 to study the recommendations of the Commission and to submit an implementation plan. This Committee was headed by the Director of Marine and had, as its members, representatives from the Ministry of Communications, the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA), the Attorney-General's Chambers, Keppel Shipyard and Singapore Cable Car Pte Ltd.\n\nThe Committee completed its work early this year. I would like to circulate this Report to Members of the House for their information.\n\n[Copies of Report circulated to Members.]\n\nSir, I would also like now to highlight the key features of the measures that have been taken to prevent a recurrence of a similar accident.SAFETY MEASURES: Sir, the Committee agreed to all the safety measures recommended by the Commission. In one particular instance, the Committee has decided for added safety to have additional constraints. This\n\nconcerns the movement of vessels in the Height Restricted Area.\n\nHeight Restricted Area\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry recommended the establishment of a Height Restricted Area within Keppel Harbour, and that only vessels up to 48 metres in height be allowed freely into the Height Restricted Area. For vessels above 48 metres, the Commission recommended that they must obtain the prior written approval of the Port Master before they can enter or manoeuvre within the Area. In addition, the Commission recommended that movements of such vessels should only be permitted when the tide is not flowing towards the cableway and provided there are sufficient tugs for use during an emergency.\n\nMaximum Height Restriction\n\nSir, the Committee agreed with the Commission on the extent of the Height Restricted Area and that vessels up to 48 metres in height be allowed freely into the Area. For added safety, the Committee further recommended the following additional restrictions for the Height Restricted Area:\n\n(a) No vessel above 52 metres in height be permitted in the Area;\n\n(b) Vessels above 52 metres in height should not be constructed in the Area;\n\n(c) Only vessels of heights between 48 metres and 52 metres be permitted in the Area provided: (i) prior written approval is given by the Port Master; (ii) the height of the vessel has been verified by one of the Classification Societies; (iii) the height has been counter-checked by the PSA using a measuring instrument; and (iv) the master of the vessel has given an undertaking that the height of the vessel will not exceed 52 metres throughout the period of the vessel's stay within the Height Restricted Area.\n\nWith the promulgated height of the cableway at 56.5 metres, the Committee's recommendation will ensure that the cableway will be protected from tall vessels.\n\nProhibited Area\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry also recommended the imposition of a Prohibited Area within the Height Restricted Area stretching 200 metres on either side of the cableway and in which no vessel above 48 metres will be permitted to encroach into.\n\nThe Committee's more stringent recommendation regarding the Height Restricted Area, in effect means that the whole Height Restricted Area has become a Prohibited Area for vessels above 52 metres. It is no longer necessary to have the Prohibited Area as recommended by the Commission.\n\nOther Safety Measures\n\nThe PSA has also upgraded its Marine Emergency Action Procedure to include emergencies threatening the cableway. This Action Procedure now includes rescue operations and evacuation of cable car passengers in case of emergencies threatening the cableway.\n\nOther safety measures recommended by the Commission have been implemented by the PSA.\n\nThe PSA has also installed a system of visual checks using survey instruments at PSA Towers and Tanjong Pagar Complex. This check will confirm that vessels are below the specified height of 52 metres. PSA will upgrade this system into an independent and automatic laser detector system next year.LEGISLATION: As recommended by the Commission, the appropriate legislation will be amended to ensure scrupulous implementation of the height restriction system and the requirement for accurate information on the principal dimensions of vessels in documents submitted to the PSA. HEIGHT OF VESSELS AS A PRINCIPAL DIMENSION\n\nMy Ministry has also submitted a paper to the 51st session of the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime Organization. The paper brings to the attention of the international body, the\n\ndesirability of including the height of a vessel as a principal dimension in the vessel's plans and documents. This will highlight the need for all, who are responsible for the safe navigation of a vessel, to be aware of its height, and bring about greater safety for international shipping.\n\nThank you, Sir.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to ask some points of clarification?\n\nFirstly, the assumption of this Report is that having the cablecar system is desirable and that the costs of diverting the vessels which are too high are minimal; now how true is this? Secondly, are there any suits in the courts outstanding against the PSA or relevant Government authorities for the loss of life and limb? And thirdly, is any insurance scheme being proposed for the cablecar network?\n\nDr Yeo Ning Hong: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is possible by judicious allocation of berths to ensure that vessels above 52 metres do not come into the Height Restricted Area. So there will not be any significant inconvenience at all. Secondly, claims have been made against the three parties - the owners and insurers of the Eniwetok, Keppel Shipyard and the Port of Singapore Authority. Some of these claims have been settled, others are at different stages of settlement. Insurance had been taken by the appropriate authorities and companies.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the members of the Committee that was appointed to study the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry had accepted that there should be appropriate amendments to the Port of Singapore Authority Act, may I inquire of the Hon. Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Defence as to when such amendments could be drafted and introduced in this House.\n\nDr Yeo Ning Hong: Sir, the amendments are currently in the process of drafting and will be submitted to the House as soon as possible.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister if the Committee considered whether the PSA had contributed in any way to this accident by failure to maintain proper standards of safety or whether there had been any omission by any of its officers?\n\nDr Yeo Ning Hong: Sir, that matter was considered by the Commission of Inquiry which had made its Report. BILLS INTRODUCED: 12.11 pmCONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL\n\n\"to amend the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore\", presented by the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Road Traffic Act (Chapter 92 of the Revised Edition)\", presented by Prof. S. Jayakumar; read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed.\n\nDEVELOPMENT LOAN (AMENDMENT) BILL\n\n\"to amend the Development Loan Ordinances (No. 50 of 1959 and No. 7 of 1961) and the Development Loan Acts (Chapter 66 of the Revised Edition, No. 6 of 1972, No. 18 of 1974, No. 1 of 1978 and No. 1 of 1983)\", recommendation of President signified; presented by the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health (Dr Hu Tsu Tau); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Income Tax Act (Chapter 141 of the Revised Edition)\", recommendation of President signified; presented by Dr Hu Tsu Tau; read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. PRISONS (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read. 12.13 pm\n\nThe Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, the purpose of the Bill is to enable a Day Release Scheme to be introduced for convicted prisoners. Under this Scheme, elected long-term prisoners can opt to serve the last 12 months prior to release in a pre-release camp. They will be released in the day to work for an outside employer and return to the camp in the evening. Where possible, they will be given training to equip them with necessary skills. Plans are therefore under way to provide prisoners with VITB-type of training courses, such as tiling, paving, plastering, to prepare them for jobs outside the prison.\n\nThe Bill therefore will empower the Minister for Home Affairs to introduce such a Scheme for prisoners who are considered suitable to take up gainful employment while serving their sentences. The Bill provides for prisoners under the Scheme to be released daily to work outside the limits of any prison. The Minister is also empowered to make regulations for the purposes of the Scheme.\n\nDuring this period when the convicted prisoners will work alongside ordinary workers, they will have the opportunity to prepare for normal life after release. It is hoped that it will also inculcate in them a sense of self-worthiness and social responsibility.\n\nSir, the Day Release Scheme for convicted prisoners will also be made available to short-term prisoners serving a sentence of less than six months, such as fine defaulters. Owing to their short imprisonment, they are not able to fully participate in educational and training programmes in the prison. Neither can they be employed in SCORE's workshops in the prison because of the high turnover which disrupts production. The opportunity for fine defaulters to work and earn market wages will also provide them with\n\nfinancial relief upon their release from prisons.\n\nParticipation in the Day Release Scheme for those eligible will be voluntary. They will be paid wages at market rates and also paid CPF allowances. They will also be covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act. They will be allowed to retain only sufficient money for fares and lunches and the balance of their wages will become compulsory savings, and with the prisoner's consent, their family members can draw from it.\n\nEligible prisoners will be considered for the Day Release Scheme by a Selection Committee chaired by a Justice of Peace. Prisoners with serious and violent criminal antecedents will not be considered for emplacement on the Scheme. Only those who are assessed to be capable of staying out of trouble and who do not pose a criminal or security threat will be selected. Prison officers furthermore will carry out spot checks on prisoners' conduct and behaviour at the worksites. Those who breach the conditions of the Work Order or involve themselves in crime will be immediately taken off the Scheme and sent back to the prison to serve out their term.\n\nIn introducing this Scheme, we are relying on our experience gained from the existing Day Release Schemes which were introduced for drug addicts in 1979, Criminal Law detainees in 1981 and Reformative trainees in 1982. The releasees under those Schemes commute daily to work in participating employers' factories outside the prisons and return to the prisons at the end of the day. They are paid wages at market rate as well as CPF allowances. More than 4,000 persons have successfully completed the Scheme since its inception. They were engaged either in construction work or in the manufacturing and service sectors.\n\nThe records show that the recidivism rate of drug addicts who had gone through a stint on the Day Release Scheme is much -lower at 48.7%, as compared to 58.5% for those who did not. Similarly, for the categories of Criminal Law detainees and Reformative trainees, there is a lower recidivisim rate. As at 31st March 1985, 403 Criminal Law detainees and 77 Reformative trainees had successfully completed the Day Release Scheme. The relapse rates of Criminal Law detainees\n\nand the Reformative trainees are 8.8% and 23.3% respectively. Comparing these rates with those of convicted prisoners, which is 32.3%, we can conclude that such Day Release Schemes do help to facilitate the prisoners' reintegration into society.\n\nThis Scheme will be implemented by the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE), whose experience in providing jobs for prisoners, its existing administrative set-up, and its contacts with employers in the private sector will ensure the smooth and efficient implementation of this Scheme.\n\nSir, our penal system in Singapore is aimed at striking a balance between the deterrent factor and the rehabilitation factor. The mainstay of our rehabilitation strategy is the work programme. A statutory board, as I have said, has successfully been running vocational workshops within our penal institutions since 1976. The prisoners are paid market wages for the work done in the Day Release Scheme. Within the prison workshops, they are paid wages based on the level of skill pegged on graded performance. They can remit their savings home. Work as an ethos, discipline, self-image and responsibility towards the family are built up.\n\nBesides work therapy, the rehabilitation programme also includes education, recreation and religious activities. A comprehensive in-prison educational programme is manned by a Principal Education Officer and 14 officers from the Ministry of Education. Academic classes for the qualifying test of 'O' and 'A' levels are conducted to help those with potential. From 1981 to 1984, a total of 239 prisoners sat for the GCE 'O' level examinations in the three language streams. 122 of them passed the examination. For the same period, 19 prisoners sat for the GCE 'A' level examinations, of which one obtained a full certificate whilst the rest had one to three passes in subjects at principal level.\n\nFinally, Sir, the introduction of Day Release Scheme for prisoners will, as with the other Day Release Schemes, bridge the gap between institutional life and their\n\nrelease into free society. It will facilitate their reintegration into society to function as socially responsible and law-abiding citizens.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think hon. Members would surely welcome this Bill as part of the effort to rehabilitate our prisoners. And as the Minister puts it very well, we seek to have a balance between the deterrent or punitive aspect of prison and the need for rehabilitation of prisoners. I also welcome the information he provided to this House in respect of the education, training and counselling that prisoners receive.\n\nSir, l need a few points of clarification on this Bill. As the Minister said in his speech, the scope for the day release scheme seems to be much more restricted than the Bill allows for. In other words, as I read the amendment Bill, it seems to allow any category of prisoners to be released, subject to the discretion of the Minister. I wonder whether that is his intention. As long as the Bill allows this, would the Minister consider allowing long-term prisoners to be put on this scheme to work outside, other than the last 12 months of their prison sentence? The fact that they are serving a long prison sentence means that there is considerable disorientation. And if these prisoners have shown that they are capable of good conduct over the years in prison, then surely they would be deserving of an earlier involvement in such a scheme.\n\nI would also like to seek assurance from him in regard to those prisoners who are denied access to this day release scheme. What avenues of appeal are available to the prisoners?\n\nLastly, Sir, there is the question of employment of ex-prisoners. What measures has the Government taken to help these ex-prisoners reintegrate into society? For example, are Government jobs open to ex-prisoners who have shown good conduct, who have managed to get further education and training while they were in prison?\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I welcome the Bill and give it the support from my Party as well. May I ask the Minister a few questions, particularly regarding the terms and conditions of the engagement of prisoners? I see under the Bill that the Minister will prescribe, by regulations, the terms and conditions of engagement of these prisoners at their places of work. May I ask whether it is the intention that the Prison authorities should find the work for them? Or is it proposed that the prisoners themselves may apply for work at factories or at places of employment of their own choice? Is it the intention that the prisoners will be allowed to contract with the employers directly and secure the best bargain for themselves? Or will all this be regulated by the Prison authorities?\n\nSecondly, Sir, about the wages paid to the prisoners who partake in this scheme, I understood the Minister to say that they will be paid market rates. Again, are these market rates to be fixed beforehand by the Prison authorities, or would they be a matter of negotiation in each particular case, ie, with each particular employer? Because if they are fixed beforehand, then they cease to be market rates.\n\nMr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I ask about the retention of part of the wages by the prisoners? The Minister has said that they would be allowed to retain part of it for the payment of food and travelling expenses. May I ask for what food consumed are they expected to make payment? Is it for the food consumed in the prison, or is it at the work place only?\n\nFinally, about the availability of the wages for the families of the prisoners. I understood the Minister to say that the rest of the wages, after paying for their food and travelling expenses, will be put into a compulsory savings account from which members of the family may be able to withdraw. I would ask that consideration be given to letting the family have the whole of the balance of the wages. I know of cases where the families have been very badly hit financially and embarrassed by finding the breadwinner in prison, suddenly. What is the objection to letting the family have the rest of the earnings without them having to make an applica-\n\ntion for every specific need? Would the Minister consider that?\n\nMaj Fong Sip Chee (Kampong Chai Chee)( In Mandarin): Sir, the Bill has just been briefly explained by the Minister. This scheme will enable our prisoners to be trained to make a living when they are released from the prison and return to society. So it merits our support. But there are a few points to raise. In the past, the Minister has been a Minister for Labour and, therefore, he is quite familiar with this type of Bill. Since the Bill will allow the Minister to stipulate regulations to enable prisoners to go out to work, it is really too good. But the question is, if he goes out as a worker, what kind of worker do we regard him? I am not joking. Maybe some people will say that he is a captive labour. If he is getting the same rate of wages as other workers, that means we are recognizing the labour and effort that he is putting in.\n\nWhat the Minister has neglected is the welfare benefit that such kind of workers should get. If there is any industrial accident, I would like to ask whether this kind of workers could get any benefit or compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act. They are actually workers because they are working outside the prison and not inside the prison. If they could get benefits of workmen's compensation when working outside, then by the same rationale those working inside the prison should also receive similar benefits. I would like to ask the Minister whether there is such a legislation. If not, whether he can provide such a legislation so that they may also benefit. Moreover, employers will also be required to insure them against any industrial accident. This is the first point.\n\nThen since they are recognized as ordinary workers, if any accident should take place, or if there is any matter involving a worker's benefit, could any trade union have the right to represent them in a claim for any compensation or benefit? This is a fundamental question. What problems they face outside the prison may not be the same as those obtaining inside. Maybe the food in the factory is not too good, or such like problems. Can the unions do something on\n\ntheir behalf? I would like to ask whether such prisoners will have the right to claim equal treatment as ordinary workers outside. We should not neglect them just because of their prisoners' status. So I would like to ask the Minister whether in the proposed legislation there is any provision enabling trade unions within certain degrees to represent them and claim benefits for them. If they are union members, then it is a different matter. Further, if the employers would support the unions in their recruitment of membership drive, whether the unions can accept such workers as members?\n\nProf. Jayakumar: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken.\n\nLet me deal with the points raised by the Member for Whampoa first. His first question was whether long-term prisoners would be allowed to be released for periods longer than the last 12 months. We do not exclude this. But our approach is to first try this limited scheme and see how it works. Based on the experience after some time, l am prepared to consider expanding and improving the scheme.\n\nThe second point on which the Member wanted clarification was whether, in the process of determining who can be selected for the day release scheme, there will be some method of giving persons who are not selected a method of lodging an appeal. This is a good point and I will ask my officials to look into providing such an avenue.\n\nThirdly, the Member wanted to know whether there are any efforts or steps taken to look into the welfare of prisoners after their release. I wish to assure him that this is being done, not only by the Singapore Aftercare Association but also through the Department in the Ministry of Community Development which is involved with the rehabilitation and counselling of prisoners.\n\nWith regard to the first point raised by the Member for Anson concerning the terms and conditions which would be the subject of regulations to be done subse-\n\nquently, he wanted to know whether it will be the individual prisoner who negotiates with the employers or whether it will be done by the relevant administering authority or the Prisons. The answer is that it will be done by the relevant authority which, in this case, will be SCORE. The reason is that it is the most practical solution to our problem because we must be confident of certain conditions, the place of work, the kind of employment, who he comes into contact with, the possibilities of contamination, escape and so on. Also, it has to be done on a fairly large bulk basis, and it will be very difficult to administer the scheme if every individual is a free agent to seek his own employment. Supervision will be very difficult.\n\nThe Member's second point is the question as to wages and market rates and whether this will be negotiated, again, by the individual or by the administering authority. Here again, for practical purposes, it must be done by the administering authority in order to get employers, manufacturers or the service sector to participate in the scheme.\n\nThe third point is with regard to the retention of wages. He wanted to know the method in which the wages are retained. What actually happens is that the prisoner on the scheme opens an account with the POSB and the monies are credited to the POSB account. It gathers interest. He withdraws whatever money he needs that is allowed for his purposes, and the family is also allowed to withdraw the money.\n\nHis question, I believe, was also whether in certain cases where the family is in dire straits, whether we would allow the family to use the entire amount. My understanding is that we are not very rigid on this and in deserving cases we have, in fact, allowed the family to withdraw a considerable amount. I am not against the family withdrawing the entire amount if the prisoner consents to it.\n\nThe Member for Kampong Chai Chee has asked certain interesting questions. First of all, his question was whether workmen's compensation would be applicable. The answer, as I have said in my Speech is,\n\nyes, workmen's compensation will apply to those released on the Day Release Scheme because they are working outside the prison.\n\nAs to whether some sort of insurance or workmen's compensation scheme should apply within prisons, this is a separate matter which I am prepared to look into.\n\nHis question as to whether trade unions can organize and recruit, the answer to that is, of course, no. Because prisoners are convicted persons and are unlike any other law-abiding ordinary persons who have not been convicted. It makes a mockery of the whole system of arrest, punishment and incarceration if we remove all distinctions between prisoners and law-abiding citizens.\n\nMaj Fong Sip Chee: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir -\n\nMr Deputy Speaker: Maj Fong, you have already spoken once in the debate.\n\nMaj Fong Sip Chee: Just a clarification.\n\nMr Deputy Speaker: All right.\n\nMaj Fong Sip Chee: When I asked the question, I had in mind, just in case, some over-zealous employer taking too seriously the NTUC campaign on recruitment. So I want the Minister to make a statement that they are not eligible.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. Jayakumarl.\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPH FILM HIRE DUTY (AMENDMENT) BILL\n\nOrder for Second Reading read. 12.40 pm\n\nThe Minister for Finance and Minister for Health (Dr Hu Tsu Tau): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nIn the Budget Statement this year, it was announced the legislative control on cinema admission prices would be removed with effect from 1st April 1985, to allow market forces to determine prices. This is in line with our policy of reducing Government regulations on business. It will also remove the anomaly whereby cinemas are the only form of entertainment which is subject to price control. The Cinematograph Film Hire Duty (Amendment) Bill (1985) seeks to effect the removal of control on cinema admission prices by repealing Section 13 of the Cinematograph Film Hire Duty Act.\n\nMr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Hu Tsu Tau].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. DEPARTMENTAL TITLES: 12.44 pm\n The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion*\n\n*The Motion reads as follows:\n\nThat this Parliament, pursuant to section 3 of the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Act (Chapter 53), resolves that the Schedule to the said Act be amended by the addition under the headings of \"Old Title or Name of Office\" and \"New Title or Name of Office\" respectively of the following: Old Title or Name of Office New Title or Name of Office\n\nAssistant Director of ) Deputy Director of\n\nPrimary Production ) Primary Production\n\n(Veterinary) )\n\nSenior Primary Production )\n\nOfficer )\n\n(Veterinary) ) Senior Primary\n\n) Production Officer\n\nSenior Primary Production )\n\nOfficer )\n\n(Agriculture) )\n\nstanding in my name as it appears on the Order Paper.\n\nCurrently, in the Animals and Birds Act, reference is made to the Assistant Director of Primary Production (Veterinary) and Senior Primary Production Officer (Veterinary). Similarly, in the Agricultural Pests Act and the Controlled Plants Act, reference is made to the Senior Primary Production Officer (Agriculture). These posts are now redesignated as Deputy Director of Primary Production and Senior Primary Production Officer respectively. The change in the titles is necessary to reflect the correct designations of these appointments.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed. 12.45 pm\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: May I just ask the Minister a clarification? I see from his motion that there are two posts - Senior Primary Production Officer (Veterinary) and Senior Primary Production Officer (Agriculture). The new title for both those posts is Senior Primary Production Officer. How are you going to show their distinct functions? I take it that they have got separate functions - one is veterinary and the other is agriculture.\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: These are officers appointed on the same grade and they perform their respective functions. The change is to comply with the present designation of these posts.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: My question is: how is the public to know which is the Senior Primary Production Officer in charge of veterinary matters, ie, who he should go and see or who he should address? And who is the Senior Primary Production Officer (Agriculture)?\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are departmental functions. For example, in the Public Works\n\nDepartment, we have senior architects. But some of the senior architects are in charge of building schools, some are in charge of building hospitals, and some are in charge of building libraries. But we do not call them Senior Architect (Hospitals), Senior Architect (Libraries) and Senior Architect (School Buildings). So those people who have dealings with the Senior Architect know who to approach. It is just like the legal officers. The legal officers are in charge of various functions. But we do not attach a title to every legal officer on the function that he is performing.\n\nDr Augustine Tan: The relevant question, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is whether someone trained in agriculture, who bears one of these new titles, can now treat a dog or a cat which is sick?\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, he will not.\n\nOuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat this Parliament, pursuant to section 3 of the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Act (Chapter 53), resolves that the Schedule to the said Act be amended by the addition under the headings of \"Old Title or Name of Office\" and \"New Title or Name of Office\" respectively of the following:\n Old Title or New Title or\n\nName of Office Name of Office\n\nAssistant Director of ) Deputy Director of\n\nPrimary Production ) Primary Production\n\n(Veterinary) )\n\nSenior Primary )\n\nProduction Officer )\n\n(Veterinary) ) Senior Primary\n\n) Production Officer\n\nSenior Primary )\n\nProduction Officer )\n\n(Agriculture) )\n\nREMARKS ON THE ADOPTION OF CHILDREN (Motion)\n\nMr Deputy Speaker: This motion* is subject to signification of support by at least one Member present in this Chamber. Does the motion have the support of any hon. Member?\n\n*The Motion, standing in the name of Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, reads as follows:\n\nThat this House regrets that the Minister for Home Affairs should have attempted to mislead the House when speaking at question time on the 18th March 1985 and again on the 29th March 1985 when moving the Adoption of Children (Amendment) Bill.\n\nThere being no support -\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: May I make a statement on that, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir?\n\nMr Deputy Speaker: No. I am asking for support. It is not possible for you to make a statement at this stage.\n\nThere being no support for the motion, the motion cannot be proceeded with.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam rose -\n\nMr Deputy Speaker: On what point are you rising, Mr Jeyaretnam?\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: To ask for leave to withdraw the motion now so that I can bring it up at a later stage. I can still bring it up, but I want to explain why I wish to withdraw the motion this morning.\n\nMr Deputy Speaker: Mr Jeyaretnam, there is nothing to stop you from submitting a motion for another sitting.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: All right.\n\nMr Deputy Speaker: I suspend the Sitting now and will resume the Chair again at 2.30 pm.\n\nSitting accordingly suspended at 12.50 pm until 2.30 pm\n\nSitting resumed at 2.30 pm [MR DEPUTY SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR] ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE (Executive powers)\n\n1. Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked the Prime Minister whether a decision has been reached on his proposal announced in the House to give the President certain executive powers.\n\nThe Prime Minister: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Cabinet has decided to proceed with an amendment of the Constitution to require the President's consent before any government is able to use up reserves accumulated by previous governments.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Would the Prime Minister say whether he has considered referring this matter to the electorate on a\n\nreferendum which he said he might consider, when speaking on this in the last Parliament?\n\nThe Prime Minister: In the last Parliament, I made my position clear: we proceed step by step. The first step is to have proposals for such a two-key safeguard drafted, commented upon, clarified, refined. Draft proposals for such a two-key safeguard have been sent by the Attorney-General to the Accountant-General, the Auditor-General, Permanent Secretaries and other senior officers concerned with the management of reserves. Their views will be considered in refining the arrangements. This will take two years before it is refined and published in a White Paper, which will then be a subject of debate.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: My question to the Prime Minister is this: will he consider referring this to the electorate, not just the Accountant-General, the Attorney-General, and the other ministries, for their views? The question is: does the Prime Minister contemplate referring this to the electorate on a referendum?\n\nThe Prime Minister: The constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority of this House. If the Member for Anson and the other Opposition Member are both convinced that the White Paper is an outrage and that it merits a reference to a referendum, the matter will be considered. But let me remind the Member for Anson that it costs, as in the case of a general election, something around $70 to $loo million each time to mount such an exercise.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Would the Prime Minister not think that on an important issue like this, where we are now going to take a departure from the style of government we have pursued since 1959, the Cabinet style of government, that this change requires consultation of the electorate, particularly, Mr Prime Minister, considering that the Government does not have a two-thirds majority of the electorate?\n\nThe Prime Minister: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Opposition Member is anxious for another bruising trial of influence, strength, and oratory.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Why not?\n\nThe Prime Minister: Let's have the White Paper, let's hear him, let's see whether the electorate wants to hear him. If so, despite the costs, there may well be a bruising experience for some of us.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam : I ask the Prime Minister for his views. Would he try and answer that question? Does he not think that, in view of the fact that the percentage of voters at the last election was below 66%, it is necessary and an act of wise statesmanship to refer a matter like this to the electorate?\n\nThe Prime Minister: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, it does not require a 66% mandate of votes cast before any constitutional amendments are made. The Member contested the last elections on the platform that the Government should not be given a two-thirds majority of Members of this House or else it could carry out constitutional amendments. But the electorate chose to give this Government that authority.\n\nComing to percentages of the House, I would ask the Member to be extremely careful about making wide-sweeping statements. Over 30% of the seats were not contested and they were the safer ones. Had they been contested, the percentages, even of the electorate, might have been different.\n\nHon. Members: Hear, hear.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Does not the Prime Minister think that is pure speculation at the moment?\n\nMr Deputy Speaker: Mr Jeyaretnam, are you not proceeding with the next question?\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Question No. 2, Sir.\n\nMERGER OF NEWSPAPER COMPANIES (Prime Minister's meeting with directors)\n\n2. Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked the Prime Minister if he met all the Directors of Times Publishing Berhad, The Straits Times Press and the Singapore News and Publications Ltd on the afternoon of the llth July 1984 before their merger into a holding company - Singapore Press\n\nHoldings - was announced in the press on the 12th July 1984.\n\nThe Prime Minister: Sir, I met the directors of the Times Publishing Berhad, the Straits Times Press and the Singapore News and Publications Ltd (SNPL) on the afternoon of 11 July 1984. When I met them, the two parties had already agreed on their merger in Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. They released the announcement of the merger terms that same afternoon.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Would the Prime Minister be good enough to say whether he saw them at their request, or whether they saw him at his request?\n\nThe Prime Minister: I saw them at the request of the two principal negotiators on both sides, the Times Publishing Berhad and the Singapore News and Publications Ltd, namely, Mr Lyndley Holloway and Mr Lee Hee Seng. They had negotiated the merger terms.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Would the Prime Minister say or confirm whether this agreement, drafted or initialled, as he says, by these two chief executives in these companies, was presented to the other directors for the first time at the meeting in his office on 11 July? And were they then asked to initial or sign the agreement then and there?\n\nThe Prime Minister: How the directors had kept the other members of the Board informed was not my business. I was asked to meet them because the two negotiators had earlier known of Government policy which I had made clear to them, namely, that there was going to be free and open competition between the two publishing houses. Let me explain.\n\nThe Straits Times Group, in anticipation of competition, had pre-empted the market. It had monopolized or bought up all the syndicated rights to all the major publications in the English-speaking world - British, American, Australian, and so on. It had also bought up the best cartoons. It had also hired the best or the better journalists. There were, therefore, considerable obstacles to the Monitor breaking into the market. I made clear to both directors that the rules would allow for fair competition, that there could be no\n\npre-emption by over-booking of syndicated articles or cartoons, and that there would be free bidding for the services of journalists, and that it was our intention to gradually allow a temporary inflow of foreign journalists to make up for the shortage of local ones.\n\nThe two chief negotiators knew what perhaps some members of the Straits Times Group did not know - that, with free rules of competition, it was unlikely that the Monitor could ever be crushed as so many other newspapers had been crushed in the past. Of course, it would have been a long and costly business, but there were three banks on the side of the Monitor - the Overseas Union Bank, the United Overseas Bank, and the Development Bank of Singapore. There were also the resources of the daily revenues of the Chinese newspapers to back it. It would have gone on five, seven more years, but there was no crushing it like The Standard, The Tribune, The Herald. The Herald did not last. It was owned by a former Chief Minister of Sabah and I knew it, and he knew it.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: It was owned by his friend.\n\nThe Prime Minister: Because he owned it, I had no intention of allowing a Chief Minister of a friendly state to help his friends in Singapore. But some members of the Straits Times Group were under the impression that they could go for broke, and therefore, I was asked to confirm that that was the Government's position. I did so and, as far as I know, I needed no other words of persuasion to let them come to the obvious conclusion that they could either take up the cudgels and slog it out for five, seven or more years, and then share the market, or come to terms as best they can. It was not the Government's intention to back one side or the other. It was our intention that because of the change in the education policies, or rather, because of the options parents had exercised to send their children to English Language schools, two major Chinese newspaper groups, whose shareholders were primarily Chinese-educated, were going to lose their future readership. I, therefore, felt that we had an obligation to give them a look-in, into the future reader-\n\nship, and that the rules must allow them an entree into the English-speaking world. They chose to settle. It would have made no difference to the Government whether they slogged it out or they settled. We have enough powers to make sure that both play according to the rules of the game. I make no apologies for these powers. They are necessary. And Singapore has prospered and thrived because we have exercised these powers wisely and judiciously.\n\nMr Jeyaretnam: Do I understand the Prime Minister to be saying that he saw these two principal directors before the meeting on the llth of July and explained to them what his thinking was? And then they came up with this draft?\n\nThe Prime Minister: A spectacular Dr Watson question! Yes, I did not see them together. I saw them separately. I made clear to each of them that there would be fair competition. I held up the entry of the SNPL group into the morning papers because they just did not have the journalists. And the arrangement was that they would be given three years in the afternoon press, build up their staff and then they could go into the morning press and the rules would be changed.\n\nMr Deputy Speaker: End of Question Time.\n\nADJOURNMENT TO A DATE TO BE FIXED (Motion)\n\nResolved,\n\nThat at its rising today Parliament do stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. - [Mr S. Dhanabalan].\n\nADJOURNMENT MOTION: Mr Dhanabalan: Sir, I beg to move,\n\nThat Parliament do now adjourn.\n\nQuestion proposed. ASIAN VALUES IN OUR SOCIETY\n\n2.48 pm\n\nMr Tang Guan Seng (Khe Bong)( In Mandarin): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a speech on the motion\n\nfor the adjournment. It is about Asian values in our society. Regrettably, the Member for Potong Pasir is not present now. On the llth July, in a speech to NUS students the Member for Potong Pasir said that we must definitely not keep the Asian feudalistic type of society as it would hold us back. Upon hearing that, one might think that there is one more champion in the anti-feudalism force and would applaud for it. This is because feudalism used to bring too much disaster in its trail, especially terminal feudalism in its dying throes, as it represents conservatism, retrogression and darkness.\n\nPerhaps the Member for Potong Pasir had exactly realized this psychology of the people to have dared to hoodwink the people by equating \"Asian feudalistic type of society\" with \"Asian values\" so as to confuse their thinking and then to advocate \"discarding Asian values\".\n\nAccording to his arguments, the Government is promoting Asian cultures and values for the sake of preserving its dictatorial role, and destroying the Opposition Party. This kind of argument is no different from his topsy-turvy type of logic about \"Asian values\" equalling \"Asian feudalistic society\". Does it mean that facts that are discernible by a million of our electorate could not be perceived by the Member for Potong Pasir?\n\nIn our 26 years of nationhood, the political institution that we have been practising is parliamentary democracy. After every four or five years, the Government will have to face the electorate who have the absolute right to choose the government they like. The two Opposition Members for Potong Pasir and Anson have come into being precisely under this parliamentary polity. There is no gain-saying that parliamentary polity has been our political institution in practice. If the Member for Potong Pasir would choose to deny this fact, he would, in fact, be denying his own qualification as an MP,\n\nHe has lumped \"feudalism\" and \"dictatorship\" together with Asian values, probably for two reasons. One reason is that he is naive and ignorant about Asian\n\nvalues and the other is that he has an ulterior motive in trying to scoop in some political capital.\n\nThere are at least two examples to show his ignorance of Asian values. Addressing some NUS students, he mentioned about the violent revolutions in Russia and China, and said that the way to prevent the overthrow of a government by force is not to advocate Asian values. I believe all those who have some knowledge of modern history would know that the revolutions in Russia and China were Communist-led and were carried out according to the Marxist,Leninist ideology of capturing political power by force of arms. This ideology originated from the West and has nothing whatsoever to do with Asian values at all.\n\nThe other example is this. In May this year, the Member for Potong Pasir in a speech used the story in a kungfu film where a selfish master would not teach his students all his kungfu movements to be-little Asian cultures and values. People have already made a laughing stock out of this shallow talk.Is this ignorant and flashy attitude not running against the \"humble and non-arrogant\" image that he has portrayed?\n\nWere it merely due to naivety and ignorance, the aberration might be corrected through learning. What is most abhorrent is ignorance topped up with ulterior motive which must need thorough uncovering and disclosure. Because if the erroneous concept were held by an ordinary person the harmful effect might not be too great. However, as it comes from a Member of Parliament, especially an Opposition leader who harangues about \"alternative government\", it becomes a serious matter. His thinking, his aberration and his ignorance, should they be put into effect one day, all our people will be affected adversely,\n\nGeographically, Singapore is situated in Asia. Our people are made up of Asian immigrants. Our forefathers came from China, India and the Malay archipelago with long cultural traditions. We treasure our cultural heritage. We have our unique customs and practices and we have our own precepts of socialization and human\n\nrelationship. The Asian values have enabled us to strike roots in Asian soil. Once the roots are extracted, we will be dispersed, floating around the four seas and become lost and confused.\n\nEven the colonialists in colonial times dared not openly call out slogans for root destruction. We want to ask: on whose behalf is the Member for Potong Pasir making such calls? And why is he so brazenly audacious? Who has given him the right to demand that we sever our roots and forget our origin?\n\nSince the Member for Potong Pasir is somewhat befuddled with what Asian values are, let me touch upon it a little. The Asian value concept that we want to preserve and cultivate has nothing to do with any political institution. The concept is one of ethics; it is a social norm, the principle of human relationship and the foundation of family relationship. In one phrase, it pertains to the attitude of human behaviour.\n\nIn our society, there is the propriety of order among members of the same family with mutual affection. It is the natural duty of the parents to bring up the children. Similarly, it is also the bounden duty of the children to look after their aged parents. Marriage is a life-long major event, not child's play. To give reins to unbridled carnal desires and free unethical sexual relationships is immoral. This sense of duty to one's family is in turn reflected in one's loyalty to the society and the nation. This is a body of time-honoured and tested valued precepts.\n\nIn the course of social development, certain retrogressive elements in Asian values, such as blind loyalty and blind filial piety and discrimination of the sexes favouring the male, have long since been discarded into the garbage dump of history. Furthermore, in preserving Asian values, we have been critical and selective in our judgment, adopting only the fine essence that is suitable to our national conditions and conducive to our national progress.\n\nExamples of Asian values that not only do not hinder but help in social and national development are not hard to find. The economic achievements of Japan\n\nare admired even by developed Euro-American countries alike. Similar examples of economic achievements can also be found in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore which are acclaimed as the \"four little dragons\" of Asia.\n\nOn the other hand, we are clear headed. We do not blindly condemn things of the West in toto, as it has just been mentioned that our polity is that of parliamentary democracy, Besides, we are also vigorously imbibing advanced Western science and technology, including management methods. Also, the untiring spirit of quest and advancement of the West too merits our emulation.\n\nHowever, in respect of the attitude of human behaviour, there are fundamental differences between the Asians and the Western people. For instance, among the Western practices that we cannot accept are: the habit of children calling parents directly by their names; the pitiful settlement of aged parents in the Home for the Aged, etc.\n\nThere is another practical significance for advocating Asian values at this time. We are witnessing a current of ill-wind of faddish trends pervading in the Western countries where the youth like to put on outlandish dresses and romp and dance in the streets. They even take to drugs and unbridled carnal excesses. In their minds, there is only individual freedom but not social or national interest. Even the Western countries are worried about this queer and decadent trend.\n\nUnfortunately, in this world of mutual dependence and an age of fast developing communication and transportation, these social ills of the West have spread speedily to Asia. Towards the end of last month, the Asia Magazine weekly published some articles centering on the discussion of this problem. The articles pointed out that in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Asean countries, including Singapore, these roaming youths can be found in the shopping centres and the fast food centres. Thus, it can be seen that the appearance here in Singapore of the \"MacDonald kids\", \"Centrepoint kids\" and \"punks\" is not a problem that only\n\ntroubles us. But there are special characteristics in our situation. Ours is an open society. The majority of our youths are English educated. After the implementation of a unified stream of education system in 1987, English will become the first language and it can be foreseen that the influence of Western decadent fads will be greatly enhanced.\n\nThus, it can be seen that the promotion of Asian values is a very timely move, as it is a correct measure to guide our younger generation towards the right path and is in keeping with the long term interest of our country.\n\nThe proposition of \"Discarding Asian Values\" by the Member for Potong Pasir other than meeting the liking of the lost youths and pleasing them, what other useful purpose can it achieve? To put forward this kind of proposition just to win over the support of a handful of people, it is really too selfish and too shallow in thinking.\n\nHere, I would like to invite the Government leadership to express the stand of the Government on the question of Asian values so that our people-will see clearly the direction of our nation building.\n\nEncik Yatiman Yusof (Kampong Kembangan)( In Malay): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to add to the speech made by the Member for Khe Bong on the subject of values that should be made principles which the people should uphold and practise, a topic which has been the subject of discussion inside and outside Parliament.\n\nHistory has confronted us with the reality of the existence of a multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-cultural Singapore because of Singapore's ethnic composition. Singapore has succeeded in achieving its present level of progress through the synthesis of the civilizations found in the Asian region. And what is more, Singapore is enjoying the fruits of its labour and progress as a result of the flux of western civilization. So it is imperative that we preserve this synthesis. From Eastern civilization which encompasses the civilizations of China, India and the\n\nMalay Archipelago, and our presence and the arrival of our ancestors in Singapore has taught us the ways of life which are founded on these diverse values. Certainly, these values, be they from the East or West, comprise positive and negative elements. Nevertheless, such values, like the value that has become the tenet stressing the importance of family-living, respect for the elders, harmonious community way of living, where public interests supersede self-interests, hard work, and the quest for knowledge to the niche of the grave constitute some of the values that we inherit from these two cultural sources.\n\nThese values did not originate from just one civilization, but from civilizations which had been intertwined resultant from the amalgam of history among the races in Asia, and Singapore is the seedbed where such values blossom and flourish. Therefore, it is to our advantage if we could synthesize the values from West and East such as the democratic parliamentary system, the urge to engage in intense thinking, to be open-minded and rational in the face of challenges in order that we can rise to even greater heights of achievements.\n\nMr Deputy Speaker, Sir, history has ordained that we possess a diversified social and economic infrastructure. A combination of political and economic social infrastructure founded on the free enterprise system has brought Singapore to a high level of advancement.\n\nThe Second Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Ong Teng Cheong)( In Mandarin): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of Asian values in our society that we are discussing about should actually be clarified by the Member for Potong Pasir. What a pity that he is not in the House. Now I would just like to state the Government's stand on this question.\n\nMr Deputy Speaker, Sir, those who are familiar with our history and understand our social and ethnic composition know that Singapore is a country strongly and deeply rooted in the Asian soil.\n\nWe were an immigrant society to begin with. Our ancestors came from India, China and the Malay Archipelago which\n\nhave long-standing cultural traditions behind them. Our ancestors have not only left for us a rich cultural heritage but have also passed on to us many precious, correct and useful values. These precious values have enabled us to transform a small barren island into a prosperous country.\n\nThis being the case, what reasons have we to discard our own precious values? What reasons have we to forget our roots?\n\nIf we should forget our roots, we shall become uprooted. Then, as the Member for Khe Bong has rightly pointed out, we shall be floating around the four seas and become lost and confused.\n\nSingapore is a plural Asian society. With the exception of a very small minority, we are Asians. Our hair is black and so are our eyes. So what we have chosen are the Asian values of our own.\n\nWe do not, however, deny that we should absorb from the Western society its advanced technology and modern management methods. We are walking on two legs, so to speak. We have the best of two worlds, the East and the West, and that is our way to success,\n\nThis does not, however, mean that we entirely negate all the Western values. Apart from parliamentary democracy, advanced technology and modern management methods, the West also has the positive spirit of striving and enterprise, worthy of our emulation. On the other hand, we do not blindly accept Asian values in toto. Asian values have been developing continuously over centuries. In the process, some of these values have become outdated and irrelevant to our society. These are the values that we must discard. What we want to promote are the values which are still applicable to the modern Asian society. These are the ethical and moral concepts of the Asians, the spirit of thriftiness and diligence. Thriftiness and diligence are the conditions for building up the national wealth. Moral and ethical values and proper human relations are the pillars of society. Asian values emphasize the personal moral character and a person's responsibility to society and the nation.\n\nIn the Confucian ethical thinking, \"The cultivation of the self leads to harmony in the family which, in turn, leads to a well-run country and peace under heaven.\" This is a good example to illustrate this point. Another example would be a saying of Mencius, \"The foundation of the nation lies in the family, and the foundation of the family lies in the individual self.\"\n\nFrom this, it can be seen that the concept of the family is very strong among Asians. It is a natural obligation in life for parents to love their children and for children to be filial to their parents. The cultivation of the individual self is the foundation for forming the family and building up the nation. The family is the basic unit of society. When the country is destroyed, the family perishes with it, and when the family has perished, its people will fall apart. This is the main difference between Eastern values and Western values which tend to emphasize individualism and individual rights and privileges.\n\nOur country is too small. For survival, we have to adopt an open-door policy and build an open society. We have no means of preventing the onslaught of external influences. If we are not careful, we shall be unwittingly and easily engulfed in and overwhelmed by the dangerous waves of undesirable external influences.\n\nAs a matter of fact, in recent years, problems have emerged in the form of youths taking drugs and hell riding. Familial and human relations also seem to be going down the drain with gradually rising divorce rates.\n\nThe Government has from time to time adopted administrative measures to counter the influence of undesirable culture coming from outside, but because we are an open society, it is not possible for such administrative measures alone to achieve the desired objective. The best way, therefore, lies in the cultivation of the individual self. The moral education - lessons on religion, Confucianism and ethics implemented in schools - is intended to bring up a better younger generation with proper values and correct outlook in life.\n\nIn the long run, the promotion of Asian values and Oriental cultures is the best\n\nway to counter the unhealthy foreign culture and protect the foundation of our society.\n\nAs a political party leader, the Opposition Member of Parliament has caused indignation among knowledgeable Singaporeans with his strong advocacy of throwing away Asian values. He has confused Asian values with the Asian feudalistic society. This shows his ignorance or superficial knowledge of Asian values. Otherwise, this would be a case of an attempt to fish in troubled waters with an ulterior motive. That he is prepared to sell out his own fine traditions and values for personal political objectives reflects clearly that he has been influenced by extreme individualism, thereby becoming a politician who is prepared to destroy his own roots and forget where he has come frorn, so long as the means justify the ends.\n\nThe Asian values that we are advocating strongly and the lessons on Confucian ethics we conduct in schools are not intended to preserve the \"Asian feudalistic society\", as he has alleged. It is neither intended to teach our children the trick of keeping 10% of the martial art from the disciples, as he has alleged. The whole\n\npurpose of moral education is to help our children understand the basic tenets of human behaviour, to build a good moral character and to improve human relations.\n\nThe bilingual education policy encourages the learning of the mother tongue. It is intended to enable us to balance Western culture with Eastern culture and to withstand the impact of Western culture, so that we can form a positive outlook in life. This has nothing to do with the political system. It is our long-term objective to build a society of excellence, an Asian society of a high degree of cultural cultivation.\n\nWe want to build a rugged and flourishing Asian people with lofty ideals and character. To build such a society and such a nation, we must strongly promote Asian values which are deeply rooted in our soil. We must ensure that such values will continue to flourish. This is our choice, and this is the right choice.\n\nThe Question having been proposed at Twelve minutes to Three o'clock pm and the Debate having continued for half an hour, Mr Deputy Speaker adjourned the House without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.\n\nAdjourned accordingly at Eighteen minutes past Three o'clock pm to a date to be fixed.\n\nWRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION SYSTEM (Decision on Revision)\n\n1. Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked the Prime Minister whether a decision has been reached on his suggestion made at a Press Conference after the results of the poll on the 22nd December 1984 that the one-man-one-vote election of representatives to Parliament needed to be revised.\n\nMr Lee Kuan Yew: There has been no Cabinet decision on my comment at the press conference on 23 December 1984 that the one vote system may need modifications.\n\nRE-DEVELOPMENT PLANS \"LITTLE INDIA\"\n\n2. Mr S. Chandra Das asked the Minister for National Development whether the Government has finalised plans for the re-development of \"Little India\" in Serangoon Road area; and, if so, what are the details.\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: The area bounded by Belilios Road, Belilios Lane, Buffalo Road, Sungei Road, Perak Road and Cuff Road, as marked on the attached plan (Cols. 249 - 250), is generally known as \"Little India\". The Government's plan is to preserve as much as possible the Indian character of the area. plan - LITTLE INDIA (Cols. 249 - 250)\n\nWithin the area, HDB owns most of the buildings west of Serangoon Road. These buildings can be grouped into 3 parcels (Parcels A, B and C in the attached plan) (Annex A) (Cols. 249 - 250). There are very few Indian related trades in Parcel A, where resettlement action is being carried out. After clearance, the buildings will be renovated to house the traditional Indian trades now operating in Parcel B. Parcel B will then be renovated to house the traditional trades now operating in Parcel C. Parcel C will in turn be redeveloped for commercial uses. Renovation of Parcel A should be completed by mid 1987 and Parcel B by end 1988. No date has been fixed for the redevelopment of Parcel C. Annex A - LITTLE INDIA (Cols. 249 - 250)\n\nThe buildings east of Serangoon Road are mainly in private ownership. The intention is to allow the private owners to redevelop while at the same time preserving the present day characteristics. URA is working on the redevelopment guidelines and a comprehensive plan for the area is expected to be ready before the end of the year.\n\nANGULLIA MOSQUE (Acquisition and Replacement)\n\n3. Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked the Minister for National Development if he will state (a) why the land on which the Angullia Mosque stands was compulsorily acquired for the \"comprehensive development of the Orchard Road area\", explaining in what way the Mosque interfered with the \"comprehensive development\"; (b) how is the land proposed to be developed; (c) why was it not possible to allow the Mosque to remain on the land, if necessary, re-built; and (d) whether the Minister is aware that there will be no Mosque for Muslims residing in a substantial area when the Mosque is demolished.\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: It is the Government's intention to maximise the use of land near MRT stations. Angullia Mosque stands on a piece of land near the Orchard Boulevard MRT Station. To allow the Mosque to continue will mean under-utilisation of valuable land. The site was therefore acquired to amalgamate with the adjoining parcels of land. The amalgamated site, bounded by Paterson Road, Orchard Boulevard, Anguilia Park and Liat Tower, will be developed into a commercial centre to take maximum advantage of the Orchard Boulevard MRT Station.\n\nURA has been working with MUIS to provide a prayer hall at the nearby URA Cairnhill Place project, to be completed by mid 1986. The 1100m prayer hall will serve the needs of Muslims in the Orchard Road area. The Angullia Mosque will not be demolished until the prayer hall is completed.\n\nCLEARANCE OF UNSIGHTLY STRUCTURES (Alternative Accommodation for Occupiers)\n\n4. Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked the Minister for National Development whether it is not an abuse of the Land Acquisition Act to threaten owners of land with proceedings under the Act in order to compel them to clear occupiers on their land of \"unsightly structures\" and whether his Ministry offers alternative accommodation to the occupiers whom the Ministry wants the owner to evict.\n\nMr Teh Cheang Wan: The letters issued by the Government to owners of properties with unsightly structures serve as an advice to them of Government's intention to clear unsightly temporary structures. They are not issued under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, neither are they an abuse of the Act.\n\nAs long as the occupiers stay on private land, the Government cannot offer alternative accommodation to them. However, it should not be difficult for the occupiers to find alternative accommodation, With the compensation given to them by the owners, they can easily buy resale HDB flats from the free market. Only when the owners and the occupiers cannot reach an agreement will the Government consider acquiring the land. Once the land is acquired by the Government, the occupiers will be entitled to resettlement benefits. ELECTRICAL SURGE IN ANG MO KIO: 5. Mr S. Vasoo asked the Minister for Trade and Industry and Minister for Education (a) what was the actual cause of the recent electrical surge at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, Apartment Block 222, where a number of households suffered damage to their household electrical equipment; and (b) whether the households affected will receive assistance for the damages.\n\nDr Tony Tan Keng Yam: Investigation by the Public Utilities Board revealed that the recent electrical surge at Block 222 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 was caused by failure of a cable joint.\n\nA contractor damaged the cable supplying electricity to Block 222, causing a short circuit. The short circuit was so severe that it caused the cable joint to fail, resulting in a high voltage surge.\n\nPUB has referred the matter of assistance for the damages suffered by the affected residents to the contractor and his insurance company. The insurance company has replied that they will consider the claims by the affected residents. PUB will be glad to assist in any way it can to help the affected residents to lodge their claims against the contractor. NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE: (intake and Part-time Courses)\n\n6. Mr S. Chandra Das asked the Minister for Trade and Industry and Minister for Education (a) how many Singapore students have been offered admission to the National University of Singapore for the current academic year 1985/86 by faculties; (b) whether there are any plans to increase the intake next year; and (c) whether the University will consider starting some part-time courses in view of the high demand for places.\n\nDr Tony Tan Keng Yam: (a) The number of Singapore students offered admission to the National University of Singapore for the current academic year 1985/86 by faculties is as follows:\n Number offered\n\nFaculty and accepted\n\nArts/Social Sciences 967\n\nScience 802\n\nMedicine 161\n\nDentistry 31\n\nLaw 176\n\nBusiness Administration 490\n\nAccountancy 434\n\nArchitecture 87\n\nBuilding/Estate Management 112\n\nEngineering 692\n\nChemical Engineering 50\n\nTOTAL 4002\n\n(b) The University's intake of students is dependent largely on the manpower needs of the nation. The University projects its intake of students in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee on Professional and Technical Education which take into consideration Singapore's manpower requirements and economic development. Any increase in intake can only be done after a careful study of these factors including the employment market for graduates.\n\n(c) The University's enrolment is still expanding and the targeted staff/student ratio has not as yet been reached in several faculties. As part-time courses will impose a heavy demand on staff members and require additional facilities, this can only be considered by the University when its enrolment has been stabilised. CORRESPONDENCE WITH MR CHIA THYE POH: 7. Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law (a) if he has received the letter of 20th May 1985 from Mr Chia Thye Poh; and (b) if he has replied to the letter and, if not, does he propose to.\n\nNote: The Member for Anson has stated: \"I have no personal pecuniary interest in this question but I should perhaps point out that I saw Mr Chia Thye Poh as his legal advisor after I was refused permission to see him as a Member of Parliament.\"\n\nProf. S. Jayakumar: The MP for Anson is fully aware that I have received the letter since a copy of that letter was sent to him by my Ministry at Chia's request. Chia in his letter merely denied the allegations against him and wanted to register his protest over the allegations. The letter did not call for a reply.\n\nFor reasons best known to himself, Chia has not bothered to challenge any of the allegations or grounds of his detention before the Advisory Board since his detention in November 1966. Chia knows that he is legally entitled to present his case to the Board which is an independent review board comprising a High Court judge and 2 prominent members of the public. He can engage his own counsel to represent him. PERMISSION TO DETAINEE TO SEE MP: 8. Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law why a prisoner may not be allowed to see a Member of Parliament if he wishes to.\n\nProf. S. Jayakumar: I believe the Member for Anson is referring to the case of Chia Thye Poh who is detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA). Chia was a member of the illegal Communist Party of Malaya (CPM). Chia was specifically instructed by the CPM to penetrate the Barisan Sosialis and engage in Communist United Front agitation to destabilise the Government. This he did by mounting a series of illegal demonstrations and industrial strikes. Chia was therefore placed under preventive detention in November 1966.\n\nUnder the Internal Security (Detained Persons) Rules 1960, only close relatives of the detainees, their legal counsel, and members of the Board of Inspection comprising prominent members of the public, are allowed to visit them. There is discretion to allow visits by other relatives or friends. Unfortunately, in the 1960's Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen visited ISA detainees and abused the privileges. They interfered with Government's efforts to rehabilitate them. They had encouraged the detainees to remain steadfast in their stand against the Government, so that their continued detention could be used to embarrass the Government. Since then the privilege of MPs to visit detainees has been withdrawn.\n\nWe have permitted the Member for Anson to see Chia as his legal counsel. PROFITS AND LOSSES OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED COMPANIES: 9. Dr Toh Chin Chye asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health if he will give the profits and losses of each of the companies in which the government has an interest for the years 1983 and 1984.\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Details of Government's share of the profits and losses of each of the companies in which it has an interest for the years 1983 and 1984 are enclosed (Annex B). (Cols. 251 - 260) Annex B - PROFITS/(LOSSES) OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED COMPANIES FOR 1983 AND 1984 (Cols. 251 - 260)\n\nEFFECTS OF HIGHER PETROL DUTY: 10. Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health (a) whether the Government is still of the view in the light of what has happened since that its objective in raising the duty on petrol will be achieved; (b) whether there has been any drop in the revenue collected from the petrol tax after the higher duty was announced; and (c) if the objective does not look like being achieved and revenue has suffered, what steps does the Government contemplate next.\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: Ad Valorem duty on petrol was raised on 8 March 1985 from 50 percent to 60 per cent of pump price to discourage excessive use of cars. Following the increase in duty, petrol sales in April, May and June this year averaged 42.8m litres per month. This represents a drop of 8 per cent when compared to the same three months of 1984. Compared to the first three months of this year, it is a 10 per cent drop. The reduction is significant even allowing for the fact that some motorists are buying petrol in Johore Bahru. Therefore the increase in duty has had its intended effect.\n\nAlthough petrol sales have dropped, revenue by way of petrol tax has increased. Duty from petrol sales in April, May and June this year averaged $38.2 million per month. This is about 33 per cent higher than the amount collected in the corresponding months of 1984 and 21 per cent higher than the amount collected in the first three months of this year.\n\nThere is no question that current measures to curb excessive use of cars are achieving the desired effect. My Ministry will continue to assess the impacts of these measures and modify or introduce new measures as and when necessary. FEES AT NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL: 11. Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam asked the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health whether the Ministry of Health has approved the fees to be charged to patients at the National University Hospital when it opens and, if the fees have been approved, to state them.\n\nDr Hu Tsu Tau: The National University Hospital (NUH) is owned and run by the National University Hospital (Singapore) Pte Ltd, a fully-owned subsidiary of Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd. As a private company, its management is responsible to the Board of Directors for the operation of the hospital, including the fixing of its various fees. These fees are not required to be approved by the Ministry of Health.\n\nA copy of the NUH schedule of fees is attached in the Annex (Annex C) (Cols. 261 - 262). The charges for the subsidised 6-bedded wards are very comparable to the charges applicable to the 10-bedded class B2 wards in the Singapore General Hospital. Annex C - NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL WARD, OPERATION, DIAGNOSTIC, OUTPATIENT AND OTHER CHARGES (Cols. 261 - 262)\n\n25 YEARS OF NATION BUILDING (Cost of celebrations)\n\nConsequent on the Question raised by Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam on\n\n14 May 1985, the Second Deputy Prime Minister supplied the following information on 22 July 1985 on the final cost of celebrations to the tax payer:\n\n\"The net expenditure, after taking into account donations and sponsorships by private organisations, revenue from sales of souvenirs, rentals, etc and other costs recovered, incurred by government for the \"25 Years of Nation Building\" celebration was $13.05 million.\"\n\nLITTLE INDIA (Cols. 249 - 250)\n\nAnnex B - PROFITS/(LOSSES) OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED COMPANIES FOR 1983 AND 1984 (Cols. 251 - 260)\n\nAnnex C - NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL WARD, OPERATION, DIAGNOSTIC, OUTPATIENT AND OTHER CHARGES (Cols. 261 - 262)\n\nColumn: 262", "url": "https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/#/report?sittingdate=23-07-1985"}
