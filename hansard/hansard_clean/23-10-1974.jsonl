ASSENTS TO BILLS PASSED: The following Bills were assented to by the President of the Republic of Singapore on the date stated:-\n\n10th September, 1974\n\n(i) Newspaper and Printing Presses Bill;\n\n(ii) Electrical Workers and Contractors Licensing Bill:\n\n(iii) Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill; and\n\n(iv) Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill.\n\nYEOH GHIM SENG Speaker, Parliament of Singapore\n\n[MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR] ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT (Payment of damages)\n\n1. Mr L. P. Rodrigo asked the Minister for Labour if he will consider introducing legislation to amend section 41 of the Workmen's Compensation Act or any other appropriate sections thereof or other legislation to provide that, in cases where the injured workman has instituted legal proceedings to recover damages or compensation independently of the Act, payment of such damages as are awarded by the Court or compensation secured which exceed $500 shall be made to the Public Trustee as trustee for the person entitled to the benefit.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee) (for the Minister for Labour): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by my Minister to reply.\n\nSection 41 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, besides giving an injured workman the choice of either claiming compensation under the Act or instituting action for damages in common law,\n\nalso at the same time reserves his right to revert to the Workmen's Compensation Act should he fail in common law. Any payment of compensation under the Act is made by the Commissioner directly to the claimants and, unless he directs otherwise, no insurer or employer may pay directly to the claimant. The Commissioner, however, cannot withhold any sum due to a claimant except minors in respect of whom he holds the amounts due in trust until they reach the age of 18.\n\nIt is agreed that neither under the present Workmen's Compensation Act nor in common law are safeguards provided to prevent a claimant from being exploited by unscrupulous persons or from squandering away the lump sum awarded to him. However, the present Act is being completely revamped. The new Bill not only provides for increased quantum of compensation but would also empower the Commissioner for Labour to withhold such sum in the interests of the claimant. He can, under the new Bill, make monthly payments instead of one lump sum, thereby ensuring that the claimant is assured of a steady monthly income.\n\nI do not think that section 41, as explained above, is the most appropriate section to amend in order to make provision that if any payment of compensation exceeding $500 is made to a workman by his employer in common law, then it should be made to the Public Trustee.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah): Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Parliamentary Secretary in a position to inform this House when this new Bill will be introduced?\n\nMr Fong Sip Chee: Sir, this Bill is in an advanced stage of drafting, and as soon as it is ready it will be tabled in this House for the consideration of Members.\n\nANSON COMMUNITY CENTRE (Alternative site)\n\n2. Mr P. Govindaswamy asked the Minister for Culture if the Anson Community Centre is affected by urban redevelopment and where the alternative site for the Centre will be.\n\nThe Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong): Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is yes, the Anson Community Centre will be affected by urban redevelopment. However, the plan has not yet been finalised and the Urban Redevelopment Authority is not able to tell when the community centre will be affected and where the alternative site will be. The Member for Anson will be informed when the site is known, and his views will be sought when the time comes.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy (Anson): Mr Speaker, Sir, when will the Minister for Culture ask the Minister for National Development to get a place? When will we get it? The Minister for Culture should insist on it.\n\nMr Jek Yeun Thong: Sir, when a site is available, the Member will be informed of it.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy: Sir, when will we get another site?\n\nAn hon. Member: As soon as possible.\n\nSUPREME COURT (Public address system)\n\n3. Mr L. P. Rodrigo asked the Minister for Law and National Development if the Government will consider the installation of public address systems in the courtrooms of the Supreme Court to ensure that justice is not only seen but also heard.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Sir, the Government does not consider that there is a need to provide for the installation of public address systems in the air-conditioned courtrooms in the Supreme Court.\n\nMr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens): Sir, with one experience behind us, can the Minister inform the House whether or not the Subordinate Court buildings that are nearing completion will be installed with sufficient public address systems to ensure that justice there will be heard?\n\nMr Barker: There will be a public address system in the Senior Magistrates' Courts in the new Subordinate Courts building to enable parties appearing thereto to hear their summonses being called. This Court will be the Court where the majority of criminal cases are first mentioned.\n\nREORGANISATION OF PRISONS DEPARTMENT (Progress made)\n\n4. Mr P. Govindaswamy asked the Minister for Health and Home Affairs (a) what progress has been made in the reorganisation of the Prisons Department since early 1973; (b) if his Ministry proposes to recommend revision of salaries of Prisons Officers; and (c) what steps have been taken to give Prisons Officers the four off-days per month.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government appointed a Committee to study the reorganisation of the Prisons Department in February 1973. The Committee made a comprehensive review of the Prisons Department and studied, inter alia, the sentences imposed on criminals, the systems of rehabilitation of prisoners and the pay and service conditions of the staff of the Prisons Department. The final Report was submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs in March 1974.\n\nThe Committee made various recommendations, including a salary revision for the Prisons staff. The Government has since accepted in principle the recommendations (other than those relating to the salary scales) and directed that the reorganisation of the Prisons Department as recommended should be proceeded with.\n\nAgreement has also been reached with the Finance Ministry to revise the salary scales of the custodial ranks in the Prisons Service and these have been implemented with effect from 1st August, 1974.\n\nBecause of the peculiar nature of prison work, it is not possible to give Prison officers regularly four off-days per month. They are given one off-day in a fortnight and, they do not, on the aggregate, work more than 44 hours per week.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy: Sir, the Prisons Department's recommendations have been accepted by the Government. Is it true that the salary scales for senior officers have also been accepted?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already answered that question just now. As I said, all the recommendations of the Committee have been accepted, except those relating to salaries. As far as salaries are concerned, an agreement has been reached between the Finance Ministry and the Home Affairs Ministry with regard to the revision of salaries, particularly those of the custodial staff, and that the improvement in the salaries of the custodial staff\n\nhas been implemented on 1st August this year.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy: Sir, has the Home Affairs Ministry recommended to the Ministry of Finance its support for the implementation of these salary scales?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: I have said that as far as the custodial staff are concerned, recommendations for a salary revision had been put to the Finance Ministry, and they have agreed to it.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy: Sir, are the senior officers included in the salary revision scheme?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Sir, the salary revision is for all the Prisons staff. But, as I have said, the improvements of salaries have been effected for the custodial staff.\n\nVIGILANTE CORPS (Particulars)\n\n5. Mr P. Govindaswamy asked the Minister for Health and Home Affairs (a) if he will give facts and figures of the progress and work of the Vigilante Corps; (b) what is the ratio of members of the Corps to instructors; (c) what measures have been taken to counsel members of the Corps who are frequently absent from parades; and (d) if he is aware that due to the poor quality of uniforms supplied to members of the Corps many of them prefer to stitch their own uniform, and what steps are being taken in this matter.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo) (for the Minister for Health and Home Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by my Minister to reply.\n\nThe Vigilante Corps (VC) was reorganised into a National Service organisation for part-time National Servicemen in 1967. Since then it has a constant inflow of about 5,000 National Servicemen annually. With the intake of more\n\nmembers, the Corps was able to extend its service in 1971 to include Civil Defence training for its part-time National Servicemen. Early this year its service was further extended with the establishment of the Community Security Force (CSF).\n\nToday, the Vigilante Corps has emerged as a large and expanding disciplined force. Out of a total of 31,089 National Servicemen in the Corps as at 30th September, 1974: -\n\n(i) 11,208 are in the Vigilante Service;\n\n(ii) 13,318 are in the Civil Defence Service;\n\n(iii) 5,892 are in the Community Security Service; and\n\n(iv) 671 are in the Auxiliary Fire Service.\n\nThe Vigilante Service is a mass youth organisation which seeks to inculcate in the men a sense of social consciousness, responsibility and discipline through civics and organised youth activities. Specific cultural groups have been formed to enrich the cultural life of our young citizens. In addition, a Lifeguard Unit was set up in February this year. Within a brief span of eight months since its inception, members of the Lifeguard Unit have saved the lives of 13 persons.\n\nIn the Civil Defence Service, the National Servicemen are trained in rescue operations, first-aid and fire-fighting, so as to meet any national emergency. Included in this field of service recently is the introduction of Lift Rescue Training. It is hoped that the availability of a group of well-trained VC National Servicemen for such rescue work will help to minimise the inconvenience that can be caused to HDB flat-dwellers in the event of power failure.\n\nSince the Community Security Force became operational in January this year, there has been a significant reduction in crime between 7 p.m, and 11 p.m, in the crime-prone areas selected for CSF\n\npolicing service. During the first six months of this year, there were on the average 21 days per month during which such areas were free of crime because of the presence of the CSF members.\n\nThe ratio of instructors to members of the Corps is 1 : 125. However, as there are some vacancies in the instructorate, the actual ratio is 1 : 172. Steps are being taken to fill the vacancies.\n\nThe Vigilante Corps has set up a counselling service for VC National Servicemen. It is part of the job of this counselling unit to go into individual cases of those who are habitually absent from duty or training. They also visit homes of habitual absentees to find out their problems and advise them to return for training or duty. Absentees working in shifts or at night are allowed to do their training during the day. Alternatively, they can attend make-up training subsequently, provided they are granted leave of absence from the usual training in advance. It should, however, be pointed out that the counselling service is not the decisive factor in reducing the absentee rate in the Vigilante Corps. With suitable punitive measures and an improved training programme, the Corps has now been able to cut down drastically the rate of absenteeism. As at 1st April, 1974, there were a total of 2,494 bad absentees and gazetted deserters in the Vigilante Corps. This number was reduced to 909 as at 30th September this year. Taking into account that the total strength of the Vigilante Corps today is 30,984 (excluding 105 deserters), the overall absentee rate has now dropped to an all-time low of 2.9 per cent.\n\nIn a mass uniformed organisation like the Vigilante Corps, it is not possible for all members of the Corps to be provided with made-to-measure uniforms. However, every effort has been made to improve upon the style and comfort of the uniforms provided for members of the Corps. Prior to 1967, the national servicemen in the Vigilante Corps were provided with uniforms made of drill. This has since been changed to cotton for the shirts and teteron for the trousers.\n\nJunior officers in the Corps are issued with uniforms made to standard sizes owing to the large numbers involved. Slight alterations to the uniforms may have to be made by individuals. The senior officers are provided with made-to-measure uniforms in view of their smaller numbers.\n\nDRUGS REGISTRATION BOARD (Setting up of)\n\n6. Dr Tan Eng Liang asked the Minister for Health and Home Affairs whether he is considering the setting up of a board for the registration of drugs, and what measures are contemplated to ensure that drugs are of clinical and therapeutic efficacy and are proven safe from dangerous side-effects.\n\nThe Minister of State for Health (Dr Ang Kok Peng) (for the Minister for Health): Mr Speaker, Sir, the setting up of a board for the registration of drugs is being considered as one of the ways in which the proposed Medicines Act may be administered. It will be necessary to draw on the experience in drug control and safety of other countries, such as the United Kingdom which has a similar Medicines Act. For instance, in U.K. there are several committees which undertake various and different aspects of drug control. There is a Medicines Committee which is charged with advising on the general policies concerning medicines, answering questions put to it, and volunteering information. There are also other expert committees such as that on Safety of Medicines, and the Pharmacopoeia Commission, as well as sub-committees such as on the prevention of microbial contamination of medicines. In our case, where necessary, committees along similar lines may be formed in due course.\n\nThe basic measure to ensure safety, efficacy and the quality of medicine will be by licensing. Licensing of the products (in other words, a registration of\n\nthe products) will be based on evidence of the following: -\n\n(a) The product does not contain any deleterious substance;\n\n(b) There is good quality control in manufacture;\n\n(c) There has been exhaustive and comprehensive testing chemically, by bio-assays and by clinical trials; and\n\n(d) They are marketed in approved forms.\n\nAs a corollary it will have to eliminate drugs which are of doubtful safety, efficacy and quality. Drugs will be screened on the basis of scientific evidence of safety, efficacy and compliance with the principles of internationally accepted standards of good manufacturing practice.\n\nThe Ministry has now five officers with overseas training in quality control of drugs and in procedures of drug registration. Inspectors will be appointed to see that the conditions imposed are observed by product licencees. They will visit the premises of manufacturers applying for licences and also do spot checks on licence holders. Drug wholesalers will have to maintain a specified standard of record-keeping and storage facilities. It will be an offence to make false or misleading statements in an advertisement.\n\nDr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley): Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Ministry of Health, in considering the setting up of a board for the registration of drugs, provide facilities for screening? What I mean is besides just checking on the claims of an importer of a particular new drug, will the Ministry of Health itself have the facilities to test the claims?\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng: We have not yet quite decided on the establishment of a board. At this stage of drafting the Bill, I am in no position to specify the details on how we would implement this measure of drug control.\n\nMEDICINES BILL (Introduction of)\n\n7. Dr Tan Eng Liang asked the Minister for Health and Home Affairs if the views of experts outside his Ministry and of interested organisations and associations are being sought in the drafting of the Medicines Bill, and when the Bill will be introduced.\n\nThe Minister of State for Health (Dr Ang Kok Peng) (for the Minister for Health and Home Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the usual practice to seek the views of interested organisations and associations at the stage when a law is being drafted. Nevertheless, a group of knowledgeable persons outside the Ministry of Health has been asked to study closely the final draft of the Medicines Bill with a view to advising on the principles and implications of the important provisions. This group of persons includes a senior lecturer in Pharmacy from the University of Singapore, a pharmacist in private practice and a general practitioner.\n\nThere are far too many organisations and associations with interest in medicinal products which makes seeking representative views at this stage impracticable. It is, however, proposed to send the Medicines Bill to a Select Committee after its Second Reading in Parliament. This will be the time when interested persons and organisations will be asked to submit their views and memoranda on the Bill.\n\nThe Medicines Bill will be presented to Parliament as soon as it is ready. This will be in about three months' time. It should, however, be noted that the Bill, being a complex piece of legislation, may have to be brought into effect in parts. The Medicines Act in the U.K., for example, has still not been completely enforced in all its sections, after it was passed by the British Parliament nearly six years ago. BILLS INTRODUCED: 2.56 p.m. ENLISTMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL\n\n\"to amend the Enlistment Act (Chapter 229 of the Revised Edition) and to make consequential amendments to the Vigilante Corps Act (chapter 80 of the Revised Edition) and the Finance Act (Chapter 139 of the Revised Edition)\",\n\nrecommendation of President signified; presented by the Minister of Defence (Dr Gob Keng Swee) read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed.

W. Barker); read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed.

POLICE FORCE (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Police Force Act (Chapter 78 of the Revised Edition)\",\n\npresented by Mr Chua Sian Chin; read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.00 p.m.\n\nThe Minister of State for Communications (Mr Chai Chong Yii): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nIn July, 1973, the Minister for Home Affairs appointed a Road Traffic Management and Enforcement Committee to formulate basic policies of Road Traffic Management as well as to co-ordinate the roles of the various departments involved in traffic enforcement and management and to supervise the activities carried out by these departments with a view to achieving greater efficiency and effectiveness in tackling the immediate, short-term and long-term traffic problems. This Committee, chaired by the Permanent Secretary (Home Affairs), comprised representatives from the Ministries of Communications, Finance, Environment, Public\n\nWorks Department, Registry of Vehicles, Attorney-General's Chambers, Public Utilities Board and the Police Force. This Committee has been superseded by the Road Transport Action Committee which was established in November, 1973, comprising five Permanent Secretaries from the Ministries of National Development, Communications, Home Affairs and the Budget and Development Divisions of Finance Ministry.\n\nAfter one year of close study and research, the Road Traffic Management and Enforcement Committee came to the conclusion that our present enforcement system is, amongst other things, noticeably lacking in the following:-\n\n(i) effective means of detecting persistent offenders;\n\n(ii) adequate penalties to deter persistent offenders;\n\n(iii) administrative procedures that allow expedient enforcement action.\n\nTo rectify this, the Committee recommended a number of amendments to the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 92). The recommendations of the Committee which have been accepted are incorporated in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill.\n\nClause 2 of the Amendment Bill will empower a Police Officer to require any person driving a motor vehicle on a road to produce his driving licence within 24 hours at such police office or station as may be specified by the officer where the person is unable to produce his licence on the spot.\n\nClause 4 of the Amendment Bill provides that if a person is convicted of an offence under the Act or is disqualified by a court from holding or obtaining a driving licence, the court shall send a notice of conviction or order of disqualification to the Registrar of Vehicles who will be required to record such particulars of conviction or disqualification and maintain such record for a period not exceeding three years from the date of the conviction or expiry of disqualification as the case may be.\n\nMuch publicity has already been given to clause 5 of the Amendment Bill. This concerns the Points Demerit System which aims at identifying and removing dangerous drivers from the roads. It also serves as a psychological deterrence against reckless driving. This system entails the giving of points by administrative means for traffic offences likely to cause accidents. A points penalty table under the Rules will specify the points for various traffic violations.\n\nWhen a driver has attained a total of 12 or more points within a year, the Registrar of Vehicles will have powers to suspend the driving licence of the driver for a period not exceeding six months. A warning notice, however, will first be sent by the Registrar of Vehicles to the motorist the moment he has accumulated or exceeded six points. On receipt of a notice of suspension, the driver has the right within 14 days to appeal to the Minister against the decision of the Registrar of Vehicles. The Minister's decision on the matter will be final. Any person whose driving licence is suspended will have to surrender it to the Registrar of Vehicles and will be prohibited from driving any motor vehicle on the roads during the period of suspension of his driving licence.\n\nClause 8 of the Amendment Bill will impose liability upon a motor vehicle owner for parking offences in cases where the particulars of the offending driver are not available. Unless the vehicle owner can furnish particulars of the driver to the police within seven days from the date of issue of the police notice or satisfy the police or the court that the vehicle was, at the relevant time, stolen or had been illegally taken or used, or establish that he did not know and could not, with reasonable diligence, have ascertained the name and address of the driver, the vehicle owner would be liable for the offence.\n\nClause 9 of the Amendment Bill will enable the Minister to make rules with respect to jaywalking. Over the last three\n\nyears, a total of 10,519 pedestrians were killed and injured by motor vehicles. In 1973, a total of 380 persons were killed in road traffic accidents, 185 of whom were pedestrians. While many of these accidents involving pedestrians could be attributed to reckless driving by motorists, a great number of these fatalities were caused by pedestrians crossing the road heedless of traffic conditions. The pedestrians, therefore, need to be disciplined as well.\n\nUnder the Amendment Bill, it will be an offence for pedestrians to cross the road other than at places where proper crossing facilities are provided. This would, however, apply to the area 50 metres from either side of any such crossing. Where the crossings are close to one another, the area of enforcement may be extended to cover the length between and a little beyond such crossings. Traffic signs will be erected to indicate the areas of enforcement. As it is not the intention to punish but to educate pedestrians in the proper use of the facilities provided for them, initially small composition fines would be imposed on jaywalkers. This may be increased later if there is no salutary effect. Jaywalking by school children will be referred to principals of their schools for appropriate action to be taken. Aged and disabled persons who are unable to make use of the pedestrian crossing facilities would be exempted.\n\nTo empower the courts to impose and enhance penalties in respect of traffic offences, clause 10 of the Amendment Bill provides for the imposition of a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months for the first offence. For a second and subsequent offence, the courts may impose a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months. For uniformity and consistency, these enhanced penalty provisions would apply to all offences under the various rules and regulations of the Road Traffic Act. The existing penal sections in the rules and regulations will be amended in subsidiary legislation.\n\nA new ticketing system in respect of traffic offences will be introduced under clause 12 of the Amendment Bill. The objective of this is to reduce the present cumbersome paper work which hinders the Traffic Police in its work and saps up extra manpower unnecessarily, thus reducing the effectiveness of enforcement action. Under the proposed ticketing system, a traffic ticket served by the policeman on the motorist, either personally or by registered mail, will be deemed to be both a report as well as a summons to appear in court. If the offence is compoundable, the ticket would also serve as an offer of composition.\n\nTo ensure that the Points Demerit System and the ticketing system function effectively and efficiently, the Traffic Police and the Registry of Vehicles have computerised their records and procedures, and the records and procedures of these two departments would be linked. Members of this House may be interested to know that these new enforcement procedures are based on systems successfully applied in countries like the United States, England, Australia and Japan. They have been recommended for adoption here after careful study and research by the Traffic Police, Registry of Vehicles, Attorney-General's Chambers and Computer Services Division of the Ministry of Finance.\n\nFinally, clause 15 of the Amendment Bill will enable the courts to accept certificates endorsed by a police officer not below the rank of inspector, as to the accuracy and reliability of radar speed traps and speedometers of police vehicles. This is required for more effective enforcement against speed hogs whose mania for speed without consideration for others often kill and maim innocent people.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, traffic law enforcement consists basically of five processes: (i) detection; (ii) apprehension; (iii) prosecution; (iv) adjudication; and (v) penalisation. For enforcement to be effective, there must be enough teeth in the traffic laws to enable enforcement\n\nofficers to carry out their task without let and hindrance. The underlying objective of the Amendment Bill is to speed up the enforcement process and, at the same time, enhance the efficacy of traffic law enforcement. It is also aimed at drastically reducing the road traffic accident rate.\n\nAll careful and law-abiding motorists and pedestrians should welcome the various provisions contained in the Amendment Bill, as they are intended to make our roads safer and to reduce the unnecessary heavy toll on lives we see today.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n3.14 p.m.\n\nMr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, the aim of this Bill is to introduce a Points Demerit System in order to deter motorists from driving dangerously or recklessly on the road. The number of road accidents is increasing every year and the number of fatalities is also increasing. The adoption of this System against reckless motorists is timely. In the Points Demerit System, because of the awarding of points - four, five or six points depending on the nature of the traffic offence - a motorist who is found guilty of offences for which 12 or more points are awarded, will be suspended from driving. So he must not commit more than three traffic offences. Otherwise his licence will be suspended for six months.\n\nI feel that such a penalty is too drastic, especially against bus drivers, taxi drivers and lorry drivers, who depend on driving as a means of earning a living. This system is a threat to their livelihood as it may break their rice bowl. These professional drivers spend at least eight hours of driving on the road. Take the case of a taxi driver. He is quite different from the ordinary motorist. He has to spend about eight to 12 hours of driving, and working two shifts in one day. I feel that we should have a different system\n\nof awarding points for these professional drivers. We should increase the maximum number of points four-fold for the penalty of suspending their driving licences. I am not advocating that taxi and lorry drivers should be allowed to commit traffic offences. What I am pointing out is that we should be sympathetic towards taxi drivers, bus drivers and lorry drivers. It is not quite correct to punish them heavily by suspending their driving licences if they are awarded 12 points, because a suspension of six months' driving will amount to depriving them of their livelihood for six months. How will their families live? Who is going to support them? And in the face of inflation and economic recession these days, the Government should see that the livelihood of these people is safeguarded. The Government should not increase the pool of unemployed or cause more hardship to the people. So we should adopt a different system of awarding points for the professional drivers. Apart from serious traffic offences, other punitive measures may be taken - for example, warnings, fines or suspension of driving licences for one week. For minor offences we should not suspend their licences for six months in order to deter them from committing further offences because we should not cause hardship to their families.\n\nThis Bill also provides for a ticket system. Careful consideration should be given in its implementation to ensure that it is not abused. For example, the officers concerned should be fair in their attitude. They should not be allowed to abuse their rights by causing unnecessary trouble to drivers so as to avoid disputes.\n\nSir, civil servants in certain departments do not carry out their duties correctly. Some of them are not even familiar with the relevant laws. For example, in the case of bus lanes, these are reserved for buses during the hours\n\nfrom 7.30 a.m, to 9.30 a.m, and from 4.30 p.m, to 6.30 p.m, on weekdays. On Saturdays, the hours of restriction are from 7.30 a.m, to 9.30 a.m, and from 11.30 a.m, to 2.30 p.m. Outside these periods, the restriction is not enforced. In other words, outside these hours all vehicles can travel along bus lanes just like any other stretch of road. However, taxi drivers have been prosecuted for driving in bus lanes outside these restricted times. This shows that the police have unnecessarily interfered with the control of taxi drivers. Beyond these restricted times, taxi drivers should be allowed to use the bus lanes as well. This shows that certain officers are not familiar with the law.\n\nAnother example of an abuse of the law concerns taxi drivers. We know that taxis have to be inspected every six months in order to ensure that they maintain their engines properly. However, at the headquarters of the Registry of Vehicles, we see policemen on the look-out for taxis. They invariably cause taxis to go into the ROV compound. This causes loss of earnings for the taxi drivers because they are asked to bring their taxis to the ROV for inspection before it is actually due. I would urge the Minister to look into this matter and to direct that department and the officers in that department to comply with the relevant laws and not to abuse their power. I hope the Minister would give special training to law enforcement officers and to see that they familiarise themselves with the laws before they carry out their duties.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, in principle, I support this Bill because it will result in a reduction of road accidents and road fatalities. But I hope that the law enforcement officers could be fair in their attitude towards the motorist, especially the professional drivers.\n\n3.24 p.m.\n\nMr J. F. Conceicao (Katong): Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the very sad state of discipline on the roads today, a matter on which much has been said\n\nin the last few weeks, and in view of the frequent display of disregard for lawful behaviour on the roads, no sensible person, I think, has any other alternative than to support this Bill completely. And I rise to voice my unqualified support for this Bill.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, it is interesting to note that this debate on the Second Reading of this Bill is being conducted actually during a period in which a campaign has been launched and is very much in the process of implementation. To my mind and to my personal and great satisfaction, I interpret this as highlighting the role of legislation in continuing public education.\n\nThe Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin): Hear, hear!\n\nMr Conceicao: Sir, may I just recapitulate a few points that have been raised during this campaign, because while there has been debate and suggestions outside Parliament, I think the final arbitrating forum is Parliament itself. So let me just make one or two points, Mr Speaker, Sir.\n\nFirst, the Points Demerit System. Instead of considering this system as drastic or Draconian, maybe we should extend it to include even the less grave offences. It may not be quite inappropriate, today particularly, for me to resort to some religious imagery. There are, Sir, mortal sins and venial sins. Perhaps what has been incorporated administratively in the Points System may be for mortal sins, but I think we ought also to give one, two or three points for venial sins. If I may just enlighten this House further on this religious matter, may I say that no amount of venial sin can equal one mortal sin. But venial sins lead to mortal sins. So I think we should also attempt to penalise those who infringe even in minor matters, just to bring to their minds the possibility that through their\n\ncarelessness they may infringe seriously. So I would appeal both to the Minister for Communications as well as to the Minister for Home Affairs to consider implementing the Points System on the basis of one, two or three points for other minor offences.\n\nAnother point I would like to bring up, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that when a licence is taken away from a person for six months or for a longer period by a court order, it is not correct to allow a person to resume driving just like that. You must remember, Sir, that this person has had his licence suspended because he has infringed the law gravely. He has been a danger to life and limb of other people. In fact, he might have been the cause of dangerous injuries to other people. And yet after a period of six months, at least, without any driving, he is allowed to go back on the road without any assurance that he indeed can drive well and with responsibility. Therefore, I think that when a person has had his licence suspended, he should not be allowed to resume driving unless he has undergone another driving test.\n\nThis brings me to another point which I would like to bring up, Sir, and that is the very high rate of failures of those people who take the driving test. The Minister's own officers will confirm that three-quarters of those who take the test fail. The average rate of passing is only 25 per cent. What does this signify, Mr Speaker? Does it signify that people go for the test on a tikam tikam basis: just try your luck without really preparing yourself for the test? Or does it signify that any Chang San and Lee Ssu can teach his brother, sister or friend to drive, and expect this person to rush off into a test? On the basis of this high rate of failure, perhaps we should seriously consider that those who wish to teach people to drive ought to be specially licensed to do so. This matter has cropped up before, I think, with the Ministry of Communications. Perhaps we could be enlightened as to why this\n\nhas not been implemented. There must have been good reasons, but I would suggest that this matter be given further consideration.\n\nAnother point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that - perhaps I may be imagining -there seems to be more \"L\" licence holders among the motor-cycle fraternity in Singapore than those who have actually passed the test. Anyway, there seems to be too many of these motorcyclists with \"L\" plates. I have been informed that they evade tests by renewing their provisional licences again and again, so that we have on the roads quite a number of people who do not feel competent to take their motor-cycle test. Perhaps some limit should be placed on the length of time during which they can be allowed to renew their provisional licences, so we can be assured that in view of the fairly high motorcycle accident rates efforts are being taken by motor-cyclists to use their vehicles safely.\n\nFinally, it is a pity that the Minister for Education is not here. I would like to congratulate the Minister for Education for coming out in such solid support for the principle and for the spirit of this educational campaign by instructing schools - oh, yes, the Parliamentary Secretary is here - to support this \"accident-free\" campaign. I think this support has to be on the basis of the entire Government, not merely of one or two Ministries. All Government Ministries should support this campaign in various ways, principally by seeing that their own vehicles obey the laws. I may mention to the Minister for Communications that I saw one of his own Ministry's vehicles committing a minor infringement. Perhaps that driver deserves one or two points! Again, I have also seen the Ministry of the Environment's vehicles on the wrong side of the road - one sampah lorry was going up a one-way street in the wrong direction. These infringements\n\nare setting bad examples to others. So I think Government departments should particularly see that their own vehicles proceed correctly on the road. And I am very glad that the Minister for National Development is here now because I think the condition of our roads requires his serious consideration!\n\nMr Rodrigo: Sir, I have no irreconcilable objections to the Bill. To me the Bill merely reflects a kind of problem that the Government will face as we reach a stage of growth and affluence and where so many bodies wish to live in order and comfort within a very limited area. This situation requires empowering the administration of the Ministry with authority to regulate social conduct. It appears to be an unavoidable course of action. Nevertheless, I think in the growth of governments the world over, it is a striking feature that as social problems expand in a society, the more does it become necessary for the administration or the Ministry to be empowered with executive action to regulate social conduct. This is the kind of situation that we are leading to. I do wish to say that, although unavoidable, empowering the Ministry with executive powers is regrettable. Therefore, it becomes very necessary for the officials concerned to ensure that the application of this authority is done in the most just way possible. In our case it is not a matter of choice or convenience. In our case I think the option is a necessary one if we are to prevent our roads from becoming a bloody scene of damaged bodies and injuries. Nevertheless, I think the absorption of executive power by the Ministry or by the administration must be explained very clearly by the Ministry or administration, illustrating to the people that the alternative is social disorder which we must all try to avoid. That is the point I wish to make in respect of the first section of the Bill, Sir.\n\nI also wish to make one observation on the Demerit System that is envisaged in the Bill. It struck me that the system envisaged is negative in approach. The system appears to me to say to the motorists: \"Don't drive fast, because if you do you will receive so many bad points\", or \"Don't drive carelessly, because if you do you will receive so many bad points\". And at the end of a period, the Bill says: \"Now that you have got so many bad points, you should not be allowed to drive at all for so many months.\" I am wondering whether or not it is possible to construct a system which has a positive approach, a system which awards points to motorists for good driving - a system which perhaps at the end of the score will be able to award privileges to the good motorist, such as a year's free driving licence or a rebate in road tax. I am sure it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Ministry's officials to try and think of a positive approach to the problem because I think that such an approach will induce the motoring public to raise their standards of social conduct on the roads, rather than confine them to a low level which at best becomes only an effort in driving without accidents.\n\nMr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to make a few comments on this Bill, but it may appear to be a bit too late at this stage; but it is better late than never.\n\nI would like to touch on the point made by the Minister of State for Communications relating to pedestrians. He said that the intention is to educate rather than to punish jaywalkers. We all know that quite a number of serious accidents were caused by jaywalking. On the introduction of this Bill, jay-walkers are let off very lightly. This will not help to reduce the number of accidents on our roads. The Minister of State also mentioned that for enforcement to be effective, there must be enough teeth given to the Traffic regulations. It appears that in so far as\n\njaywalking is concerned, we are merely giving the regulations false teeth. Especially at the junctions of North Bridge Road / Stamford Road! Bras Basah Road, you can see hoards of jaywalkers crossing the roads when the traffic lights favour the motorists. As a result many motorists have to play hide and seek with such careless pedestrians and run the risk of running down innocent bystanders. All these careless pedestrians should not be let off so lightly for their negligence, which however is the case with this Bill. I feel that the provisions against jaywalking are inadequate, and this will not help to reduce the number of accidents that occur every day.\n\nMy colleague, the Member for Sembawang, has pointed out that certain provisions of the Bill are too drastic against professional drivers, and he mentioned the case of bus and taxi drivers. He says that if a bus driver or a taxi driver is suspended from driving for six months, it will more or less affect his rice bowl. I wonder whether my colleague has given some thought to the problems of the victims of such reckless driving - those who die on the roads through the negligence and recklessness of bus drivers, taxi drivers and lorry drivers. Who will be responsible to look after their families? I would like to quote a few instances where accidents were caused by negligent bus drivers, as this will probably help to change his mind.\n\nIn Toa Payoh alone there were so many accidents involving bus drivers. A bus overturned while rounding a circus in Lorong 7, Toa Payoh. Luckily, nobody was injured, other than causing a fright to the driver. Two buses on going out of the bus terminus ran into a drain. We had one instance in which a bus attempted to go over the flyover but crashed into the railings instead. Here again, it was fortunate that it caused only a few injuries. In another case in Toa Payoh Central, two buses collided head-on, causing injuries to 22\n\npeople. In another accident in Dunearn Road only two months ago, a bus ran into the path of another bus and 15 persons were injured. In Queenstown there were about 20 to 30 bus commuters waiting at a bus stand, and there came along a bus which ran into them and knocked down the bus stand. In another case in Punggol, a bus attempted to run beyond Punggol Point! We have yet another case where a bus ran into the car of the Honourable the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education. All these instances are examples of negligent driving of bus drivers, and I feel that if no adequate punishment is meted out to such bus drivers, we can never hope to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on our roads.\n\nI support all the provisions in the Bill except the provision covering pedestrians, and I hope the Minister will consider introducing more severe penalties for jaywalking.\n\nMr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore today I find it difficult to drive around and I find it even more difficult to walk around. Although I support this Bill, I feel that it is not quite so effective. It is like leaving a headache to cure itself, or when your foot aches you treat it yourself. If we want to reduce the number of accidents we will have to reduce the number of vehicles and drivers. I agree with Members that the minimum age for holding a driving licence should be raised to 21 years. This is a correct move. If we do not allow more drivers on the road, the Government can easily reduce the number of private car ownership. This will lead to a reduction in the number of accidents.\n\nSir, I am not against the introduction of the Points Demerit System. It is only a medium to treat the symptoms of a permanent ailment. It does not cure the pain fundamentally. In the Points Demerit System many different points of view have been given. Some Members think that we should be even\n\nmore strict, but the Member for Sembawang feels that it is already too strict for the professional drivers. I am in full sympathy with him. The case for these professional drivers is just like the Chinese saying that if you go to the mountain often enough, chances are you will be eaten by the tiger. Therefore, I think the Government should give some consideration to this point of view.\n\nSir, I support this Bill.\n\n3.45 p.m.\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu): Mr Speaker, Sir, for any law to be effective, there must be enforcement. But as far as the management of road traffic is concerned, we seem to have a rather peculiar situation where the law is made by one Ministry, but without any control over its enforcement. We have the Traffic Police in the Ministry of Home Affairs taking care of the enforcement of this Bill introduced by the Ministry of Communications. To me it would be logical either for the Minister for Home Affairs to take charge of administering the Road Traffic Act, or for the Traffic Police to be transferred to the portfolio of the Minister for Communications. I really cannot see how the present system can be effective. I think what one Member has just said is quite true, that this is one of the most inherent weaknesses in our entire system of road traffic management.\n\nMr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill. In fact, this Bill should have been introduced a few years ago. Many innocent persons have died or seriously injured by the actions of inconsiderate drivers who drove their motor vehicles recklessly and dangerously.\n\nSir, according to the pamphlet on the Points Demerit System, six points will be given for reckless or dangerous driving. I think this is too lenient a punishment for such a serious offence, as a reckless and dangerous driver could kill an innocent person. I would request\n\nthe Minister of State for Communications to give serious consideration to immediately suspend the driving licence of a driver for a period of six months if he is found guilty of reckless and dangerous driving. This is more effective than giving him six points for the offence, which is too lenient a punishment.\n\nMr Chai Chong Yii: Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to answer first in Mandarin to the points raised by two Mandarin-speaking Members of Parliament.\n\n(In Mandarin) Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for Sembawang mentioned the Points Demerit System. According to him, the system of awarding points is too drastic. If you commit a traffic offence three times, you would reach the maximum of 12 points, that is, if you get four points for each offence, then after three offences you will reach the maximum of 12 points allowed to you and your driving licence will be suspended for up to six months. In his view, this is too drastic.\n\nHowever, we have heard the Member for Toa Payoh saying that this system is not strict enough as we should consider the plight of the families of victims of such accidents. He has also given a number of instances of negligent driving by professional drivers to support his point of view.\n\nHowever, as this system is new, I do not think the professional drivers need be over-concerned about it. Whether the effects of the implementation of this system will be as bad as what the Member for Sembawang thinks, we will be able to know only after some time. He has also recommended that the period of suspension should not exceed one week. Of course, he is quite justified in being concerned about the plight of professional drivers as, if I am not mistaken, he is the adviser to the Taxi Drivers Association. But I think we will have to wait for a certain period to see the full effects of this new Bill.\n\nHe also brought up the question of the ticketing system, and added that the\n\nofficers should not abuse their powers. I think every one with any conscience - every Government official, every civilian, every Member of Parliament, and every law-abiding citizen -believes in this. But what is an abuse of authority, or what constitutes an abuse of authority? This is rather ambiguous and cannot be defined clearly. However, if the Member does come across instances where such abuse has taken place, I shall be pleased to know more about the details of the particular case so that I can try my best to investigate and see what can be done.\n\nThe Member for Bras Basah mentioned that the Bill is only a means of treating the symptoms and is not a fundamental solution to the problem. The provisions of this Bill are new, but we know that in many other countries similar provisions have already been effectively implemented. Let us wait for some time before assessing the effects of this Bill and come to the conclusion whether or not it is sound or effective.\n\nHe also mentioned the point about reducing the number of vehicles as the basic and fundamental solution to the problem. He further mentioned that the minimum age of drivers should be raised from 17 to 21 years. On these two points, of course, the reduction in the number of vehicles will help to reduce accidents because, in theory at least, if there are fewer vehicles, the number of accidents should correspondingly decrease. But this is not something that we can do immediately because reducing the number of vehicles may affect the livelihood of many people. The policy of the Government is very clear. In the last few months, we have repeatedly announced our policy in respect of this problem. We will try our best to restrict the number of unnecessary vehicles on our roads. On the question of the age of the drivers, there are several conflicting points of view. Young people, of course, feel that the age should not be raised. There are some young people who are reckless or who are not so careful. But up to now, we have no concrete and positive evidence to show that drivers\n\nin this age group of 17 and 21 years are accident-prone. We know that young people today learn a lot of skills, and they learn various skills at an early age. Of course, they would like to obtain the skills at an even earlier age. And driving is one of the skills they would like to acquire at an early age. So for the time being, I cannot give him a very satisfactory answer because I think time is needed to see the development of these events.\n\n(In English) Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may now answer the other Members of Parliament in English.\n\nI appreciate the support of the Member for Katong. He raised the point on the re-issue of driving licences. He 3pecifically maintained that a re-test should be given to those whose licences have been suspended, and not just re-issue licences to them on expiry of the suspension period. We all know that our driving test centres are unable to cope with new drivers right now. So if we are going to implement his suggestion, I think the queue will be even longer. `There is merit in his suggestion, but it takes some time to see whether it can he worked out administratively.\n\nHe also mentioned about \"L\" motorcyclists. The Ministry of Communications has recently introduced administrative action to ensure that an \"L\" motor-cyclist should try to pass a riding test within three years or else he has to re-sit the Highway Code test before another \"L\" licence can be issued to him. This is, in fact, one administrative step ahead to persuade \"L\" riders to sit for the test. The large number of these \"L\" motor-cyclists that we see on our roads is partly due to the fact that the majority of them just do not bother to apply for a test because the fee for an \"L\" driving licence is just twice the fee for an ordinary driving licence. But with the introduction of this new ruling, I am sure the number will be reduced.\n\nRegarding his comment on Government vehicles, I can only assure him that Government vehicles enjoy no privileges.\n\nTo the Member for Serangoon Gardens, I thank him for his support of the Bill. He mentioned about the positive measures instead of the Points Demerit System which, he says, is negative in approach. Legal action by itself is negative. It is only by educating our people, the next generation, to be better educated, that I think the approach through education will be a more positive one. As for awarding privileges to good drivers, I doubt this could be implemented administratively because it will become too complicated an issue.\n\nThe Member for Toa Payoh has suggested that jaywalkers should not be let off so lightly, and he commented that the penalties provided for jaywalking are not enough. I mentioned in my speech that initially the penalties are meant to educate the jaywalkers, hut if we find that they persist in jaywalking and their accident rate is still high, then the existing law has provision to increase the penalties. It is, therefore, not necessary to provide heavy penalties to deal with them at this stage. The existing law is quite adequate, and because it is something new I feel that initially jay-walkers should be given a chance.\n\nAs for the Member for Jalan Kayu's comment that the law is made in one Ministry and enforced by another, I have listened to it with deep interest and I have no comments to offer.\n\nThe Member for Bukit Ho Swee supports the Bill. He has specifically pointed out that the penalty of six points for dangerous driving is too lenient. The Points Demerit System can be administratively changed. If it is subsequently proved that six points are not adequate to deal with this group of reckless drivers, perhaps they can he increased. I hope I have answered all the questions.\n\nMr Conceicao: On a point of clarification, Sir. In his reply to my suggestion that those who are suspended need another test, the Minister of State stated that there are so many people waiting for tests that this is not feasible. Is he implying that it is more beneficial to\n\nlet a suspended driver off without a re-test than to keep a few other people waiting? Or is he expecting so many people to have their licences taken away that his officials have no time to give another test?\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a little puzzled by his \"no comment\" reply because either you agree or you do not agree. By not giving a firm answer, he has given me the impression that perhaps he agrees, but for political reasons he does not want to offend his colleague.\n\nThe Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin): Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may follow up on the Member for Jalan Kayu's comments. He has raised a most interesting point on the question of traffic problems and its solution, that is, the Road Traffic Act comes under the Ministry of Communications but its implementation falls within the purview of the Traffic Police which comes under the Ministry of Home Affairs. This unfortunately has been the position for quite a long time. It is a matter which we have referred to the Management Services Unit of the Ministry of Finance to look into especially the reorganisation of the Registry of Vehicles. After a study of about eight months, they produced a report which recommended that an Authority for Inland Transport be established to bring into it the Registry of Vehicles, the Roads Department of the Ministry of National Development, the Car Parks Division, as well as the Traffic Police of the Ministry of Home Affairs. That was the suggestion put up if we are to make an effective contribution towards the resolution of traffic problems as a whole. Arising out of this, as was stated in the Second Reading speech of the Minister of State, a Road Transport Action Committee was formed in November last year comprising five Permanent Secretaries from four Ministries, that is to say, the Ministries of National Development, Communications, Home Affairs and two Permanent Secretaries from the Ministry of Finance, one from Budget\n\nand the other from the Development Division. That is why over the past one year, i.e, from November last year until today, there has been a co-ordinated effort to resolve the problems of traffic in general, and I think we are going places now with this large, all-powerful, high-powered co-ordinating committee.\n\nAlthough the present amendments to the Road Traffic Act were initiated by my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, the group of officials from the various Ministries and departments involved in road traffic had to come together to produce these two systems, the Points Demerit System as well as the Ticketing System. This is a means towards an end, and we believe that these two measures will contribute a great deal towards a rationalisation of our traffic problems and should be able to reduce considerably the havoc, the carnage of human lives that are being lost every day.\n\nThis is not the only problem that is being tackled by the Road Transport Action Committee. There are other measures. In fact, there are as many as ten measures going on simultaneously at this moment. Various traffic management measures are in force or will be introduced that would completely change the pattern of traffic as we see it today.\n\nMr Speaker: The Member for Katong's other question has not been answered.\n\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin: Yes, Mr Speaker. There is also a valid point raised by the Member for Katong when he talked of mortal sins and venial sins. It is true that under the Points Demerit System points are awarded for very serious offences. In fact, the aim of the Points Demerit System is to identify and remove dangerous drivers first so that the less dangerous drivers will be looked into later. The idea is that we should first deal with those with serious sins. Those with venial sins, the minor ones, we will come to them after this\n\nsystem has been fully implemented. It is a question of a step by step approach. The more serious ones come first, to be followed later by the less serious ones when points will have to be awarded for minor offences.\n\nMr Conceicao: Sir, would the Minister like to touch on the point regarding the suspension of licence and the necessity for a test? I have asked the question, \"Are we expecting so many suspensions that the testers would not be able to attend to them; or i5 it more beneficial to keep a few people waiting than to get these people who had their licences suspended to come for a retest?\"\n\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin: Since the Member for Katong is so persistent, I will say this. After having had his licence withdrawn for six months, I think as a first penalty he would be cautioned to be more careful when he gets back his licence. We can give it a trial.\n\nMr Conceicao: But he has not driven for six months!\n\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin: That is all right. There are people who have not driven for six years, and yet they are still careful when they drive.\n\nMr Conceicao: But this one is not a careful driver.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Chai Chong Yii].\n\nBill considered in Committee. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\n4.10 p.m.\n\nClauses 1 to 9 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClause 10 -\n\nMr Chai Chong Yii: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\n\nIn page 8, line 3, to leave out \"offence\" and insert \"conviction\".\n\nThis is to rectify a typographical error.\n\nAmendment agreed to.\n\nClause 10, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClauses 11 to 15 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nBill reported with an amendment; read a Third time and passed. NAVAL AND AIR BASES (REPEAL) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n4.13 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, the Naval and Air Bases Ordinance (Chapter 83 of the 1955 Edition) vests in the Lord High Admiral, or the Commissioners for the time being executing the office of Lord High Admiral, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Air Council established under the United Kingdom Air Force (Constitution) Act, 1917, certain rights over portions of the foreshore and seabed of Singapore in trust for Her Majesty for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a naval and air base in Singapore.\n\nIn the Exchange of Notes on Defence Arrangements between the Government of the Republic of Singapore and the Government of the United Kingdom, it was agreed, inter alia, that the Ordinance should be repealed. The Bill now before this House seeks to give effect to this Agreement and will repeal the Naval and Air Bases Ordinance. On the repeal of this Ordinance, such rights as mentioned will vest in the Singapore Government.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. CANCELLATION OF PLANNING PERMISSION BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n4.17 p.m\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nHon. Members will recall that Government made a policy statement on the 10th of September last year and announced certain measures which it proposed to take to curb excessive speculation in land and property and to check the steep rise in their values. One such measure was that all planning approvals granted but on which no attempt had been made to get on with the work would be cancelled unless there was a firm contract for construction work between owner and building contractor signed on or before the 10th of September last year or the owner/developer had signed binding contracts for the sale of residential properties with purchasers. In order to implement the above decision, it was necessary to cancel all planning approvals granted before 10th September, 1973, under section 9 of the Planning Act. These would otherwise be valid for a period of two years by virtue of subsection (8) of section 9 of the Act. There were, in all, 329 cases of development affected by this policy. Planning permission for 270 cases have since been restored.\n\nIt is also necessary to treat as cancelled all planning permission granted before 1st February, 1960, under section 61 of the Singapore Improvement Ordinance, and those granted between 1st February, 1960, and 12th December, 1965, under the 1959 Planning Ordinance if no work had been carried out by 10th September, 1973. Although sections 10 and 11 of the present Planning Act empower the Competent\n\nAuthority to cancel such planning permission, there was no provision in the Singapore Improvement Ordinance or the 1959 Planning Ordinance to allow planning permission to lapse automatically after three years if no development took place. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill provide for cancellation of any planning permission granted before 11th September, 1973, including any granted under section 61 of the Singapore Improvement Ordinance if no construction work had commenced before that date.\n\nClause 5 provides for the exemption of certain categories of planning permission from cancellation, such as minor alterations and additions to existing buildings and housing development involving not more than four residential units.\n\nClause 6 empowers the Minister to restore in his discretion any permission cancelled upon such conditions, as he sees fit to impose. It is necessary to make the Act operative as from the 11th day of September last year. This is so provided in clause 1.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. FORESHORES (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n4.23 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nAs hon. Members are aware, I have from time to time sought the approval of this House under section 4 of the Foreshores Act for the Government to\n\nconstruct public works along the fore-shore or in the sea-bed.\n\nSection 4 of the Act as it now stands requires Government to seek the approval of Parliament for the reclamation of the foreshores or sea-bed as well as for the construction of public works, including wharves or jetties, along the foreshores. In order to expedite the construction of public works, the Bill now before this House seeks to amend section 4 of the Act to enable Government to construct such public works along the foreshores or in the sea-bed without the necessity of seeking approval of this House.\n\nThe Bill also seeks to authorise the Government to reclaim the foreshore or sea-bed without having to seek the prior approval of this House if the area to be reclaimed does not exceed 20 acres or, if the area to be reclaimed is within port limits, 10 acres.\n\nThe Bill further seeks to delete paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of section 9 of the Act which implies into a lease of the foreshore or sea-bed certain covenants and provisos with regard to the construction and use of any works to be made or done thereon. It is considered that these covenants are not necessary in the light of present-day requirements.\n\nOpportunity is also taken to amend subsection (6) of section 3 of the Act to provide that section 3, which imposes restrictions on the construction of sea and river walls and buildings on the banks of any port, river or channel, shall not apply to any statutory body as the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint.\n\nSir, I beg to move,\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\n\nMr Speaker: Order. I suspend the Sitting now and shall take the Chair again at 5.00 p.m.\n\nSitting accordingly suspended at 4.29 p.m. until 5.00 p.m.\n\nSitting resumed at 5.00 p.m. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR] ESTATE DUTY (AMENDMENT) BILL\n\nOrder for Second Reading read.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nHonourable Members of the House will recall that in my Budget Speech early this year, among the tax concessions which I announced was one for the relief from estate duty by a combination of exemption and remission. The reasons for the relief were explained fully at that time and I do not, therefore, propose to repeat them here.\n\nI need only say that this Bill seeks to provide the relief announced by amending the Estate Duty Act (Chapter 137 of the Revised Edition) to set higher limits of exemption of estate duty at $50,000 of the principal value of the estate passing on or after 1st April, 1974.\n\nIt is intended that a Remission Order will be made also to take effect on the same date, remitting estate duty at a progressively declining rate, by 10 per cent for every $20,000 in excess of the principal value of $50,000.\n\nClause 2 amends subsection (1) (g) of section 6 of the principal Act to provide for assessment of an estate passing on or after 9th August, 1965, and before 1st April, 1974, at the graduated scales set forth in the Fifth Schedule to the principal Act. It also adds a new subsection (1) (h) to provide for the assessment of an estate passing on or after 1st April, 1974, at the rates given in the Eighth Schedule to this Act.\n\nClause 3 makes an amendment to the Fifth Schedule so that in the case of an estate passing before 1st April, 1974, the estate duty rates given in this Schedule shall continue to apply.\n\nClause 4 introduces the new Eighth Schedule which provides for exemption of estate duty on the first $50,000 of the principal value of the estate.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. CUSTOMS (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n5.05 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe Bill seeks to amend the Customs Act (Chapter 133 of the Revised Edition) to strengthen and improve customs enforcement and administrative procedures.\n\nClause 3 seeks to amend section 18 of the Customs Act to empower the Comptroller of Customs to refund composition fines which have been overpaid or erroneously paid. At present, all applications for such refunds have to be referred to the Minister for Finance. This amendment is intended to facilitate administrative procedures.\n\nClause 4 proposes to amend section 20 of the Customs Act to render customs duty payable at the time instead of, as presently provided, \"on the day\" of the removal of the goods from customs control. The amendment is intended to enable immediate changes\n\nof duty to be imposed at any time of the day, for example, at 3 p.m, instead of only at midnight, so that the revised rates will be immediately effective upon removal or release of the goods.\n\nSection 21(8) (c) of the Customs Act provides that the rate of exchange for assessing the duty on imports shall be based on the rate existing at the time the goods are removed from a Government warehouse, licensed factory warehouse or licensed warehouse. Clause 5 substitutes for this a provision merely that the rate of exchange for the assessment of import duty shall be the rate at the time customs duty is paid. This amendment is introduced as, in practice, goods are removed often not from licensed warehouses but from the Free Trade Zone or at the point of entry such as Woodlands.\n\nThe Customs Act at present is deficient in provisions for the control and supervision of dutiable goods in transit. Despite this limitation, Customs has exercised control by requesting ships which call at the port to supply lists of such goods. Clauses 6, 7, 10 and 12 propose to amend sections 29, 34, 39 and 43 of the Customs Act respectively to give legislative sanction to the existing practice in customs control and supervision of dutiable goods in transit.\n\nClause 10 seeks also to amend section 40 of the Customs Act to empower the Comptroller of Customs to hold the master, owner or agent of the vessel, or the pilot, owner or agent of the aircraft, or the station master of a railway station responsible for dutiable goods found short or missing on board a vessel, aircraft or train. This is intended to prevent smuggling and to make masters of vessels more cautious when endorsing manifests.\n\nClause 15 proposes to amend section 61 of the Customs Act to ensure that a licence is taken out before intoxicating liquors imported in bulk are bottled.\n\nThe existing provisions in the Customs Act do not require a wholesaler to obtain a licence to sell beer or a retailer who sells beer in bottles which have not been opened from Customs control for consumption elsewhere than at the place of sale. In practice, consumption often takes place at retail beer shop premises. Clauses 16, 17, 18 and 19 therefore seek to amend sections 64, 65, 67 and 70 respectively of the Act to provide for licensing the sale of beer by wholesale or retail. A licence will now be issued only when health, police and customs requirements are met. This will enable a more meaningful and manageable control to be exercised over the licensees.\n\nUnder clause 22, section 84 of the Customs Act is amended to empower the proper officer of customs to require a person to give information or produce documents at a specified customs office or station.\n\nClause 23 seeks to amend section 91 of the Act to enable the Comptroller of Customs to charge such fees as may be appropriate for the supply of customs documents or for rendering services to the public. These services include supervising the operations in a factory or warehouse, attending to the destruction of dutiable goods, and overseeing the packing and sealing of cases and packages of duty-paid goods for re-export under the draw-back scheme.\n\nThere is, at present, no provision for customs officers to search premises of importers for documents in connection with under-declarations and revenue evasion. As such searches are an essential part of Customs preventive and revenue evasion work, it is proposed in clause 24 to amend section 94 of the Customs Act to specifically empower customs officers to search premises for this purpose.\n\nThe inclusion of the new section 99A under clause 27 is to legalise the setting up of road barriers by customs officers in the course of their duty. This provision is to protect customs officers from any claims arising out of any accident caused by these road barriers.\n\nUnder clause 28, a new section 109A is included to provide that any report from a Government chemist on any matter submitted to him for examination may be used as prima facie evidence by the prosecution in any proceedings for an offence under the Customs Act.\n\nThe maximum fine for making incorrect declarations or falsifying documents as provided under section 119 of the Customs Act is $5,000. Clause 30 seeks to increase this limit to the amount of Customs duty payable, if the duty exceeds $5,000. It also seeks to make it an offence for any person to omit any material particulars in a Customs declaration which he is required to disclose. The proposed amendments are aimed at deterring evasion of customs duty.\n\nPresently, the Customs Department has to rely on the Police for action under the Minor Offences Act against persons who abuse its officers. The penalty as provided in the Act is a fine not exceeding $50. Clause 31 proposes to empower Customs to deal with such an offence, and clause 32 increases the penalty from $2,000 to $3,000. This will enable Customs to prosecute offenders expeditiously and is intended to be an effective deterrent.\n\nThe other amendments are either consequential or are designed to tidy up procedural matters.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. JURONG TOWN CORPORATION (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n5.19 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nIn planning the development of the Jurong industrial estate, the aim of the Jurong Town Corporation is to see it evolving into a self-contained new town. As part of the plan, low-cost flats have, therefore, been built so that workers may stay near their places of work. So far, 14,440 units have been completed.\n\nIn line with Government's policy to encourage home ownership, the JTC has been selling some of its low-cost flats since December, 1969. To-date, 3,461 units have been sold. It is hoped that such sales will encourage more workers to settle permanently in Jurong and that there would, therefore, be added stability to the workforce there.\n\nThe JTC sale of flats has been on terms and conditions similar to those applied by the Housing and Development Board, and elaborated in new sections 36 to 47 introduced under clause 7 of this Bill. Under these terms and conditions, strict conditions to prevent flats sold on instalments from falling into the hands of speculators and profiteers have been imposed. Such stringent conditions apply also to executive flats built in Jurong for middle management.\n\nFlats may be sold only to those buying for their own occupation and owning, by themselves or their spouses, no other residential property. A flat purchased on false pretences will not be registrable and will revert to the Corporation without any refund of payments already made.\n\nThe provisions of the new sections as contained in clause 7 of the Bill also simplify formalities for registration of sale, mortgage and discharge required under the Registration of Deeds and\n\nLand Titles Acts. These provisions will help purchasers, who would otherwise be put to some inconvenience and high legal costs. Transfers on the death of the owner will normally be allowed. However, should the Corporation refuse such consent, it is required to buy the flat back. If the price offered is considered to be unsatisfactory, the party involved may appeal to the Minister, whose decision shall be final.\n\nThe Corporation is empowered to require owners of flats to form management corporations to maintain their flats. If the Corporation's direction in this regard is ignored, it may authorise any company to exercise the functions, duties and powers of a management corporation. The Corporation may also perform these functions itself. The costs of such management and maintenance services will have to be met by flat owners.\n\nOpportunity has also been taken in this Bill to make other amendments to the Jurong Town Corporation Act. The present membership of 15 is considered unwieldy and is to be reduced to nine, including the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman. The quorum required for a meeting of the Corporation is accordingly reduced from eight to five members.\n\nIn clause 4, the Corporation's functions are extended so that in the sale of its flats it may provide loans on mortgage at such interest as may be prescribed.\n\nClause 5 repeals sections 20 to 23 of the principal Act. It also re-enacts, with amendments, parts of section 20 of the principal Act by placing the responsibility of keeping the accounts of the Corporation in a Chief Financial Officer instead of a Financial Officer. This is necessary because of the redesignation of the post. The amended section 20 also sets out the other responsibilities of the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nNew provisions relating to the appointment and powers of the Corporation's auditor have also been introduced. The Chief Financial Officer\n\nis also required to prepare and submit annually financial statements to the Corporation's auditor who shall audit and report on them.\n\nFurther new provisions are introduced under clause 5 requiring the submission to the Minister of annual financial statements and a copy of any report made by the auditor which the Minister will present to Parliament. Provision is made for scrutiny of these reports by the Auditor-General at the same time as they are submitted to the Minister, where the Auditor-General has not been appointed to be the auditor of the Corporation.\n\nClause 6 of the Bill repeals sections 29 and 30 and re-enacts section 29 which deals with the submission of the Corporation's Annual Report to the Minister by the 31st of March each year and the submission of the Report by the Minister to Parliament.\n\nClause 2 amends section 2 by introducing a definition of a \"flat\" which has hitherto not been defined in the principal Act.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\n\nBill considered in Committee. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\n5.25 p.m.\n\nClauses 1 to 6 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClause 7 -\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Sir, I beg to move,\n\nIn page 10, line 31, to leave out \"and\".\n\nSir, this is an obvious error.\n\nAmendment agreed to.\n\nClause 7, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nBill reported with an amendment; read a Third time and passed. DEVELOPMENT LOAN BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n5.28 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe Development Loan Act, 1972 (No. 6 of 1972), authorises a sum of $2,000 million to be raised by way of loan for the purposes of the Development Fund. To date, a total of $1,585 million has been raised under the provisions of the Act, leaving a balance of $415 million only to be raised. Although the Government will continue to seek as much in the way of external loans as possible from the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the international money markets to help finance its development programme, the need will remain to mobilise domestic resources by the issue of local stock or bonds. In order to meet the needs of our development financing, it is possible that more than $5,000 million may have to be raised over the next five years.\n\nThe Bill which is now before the House is necessary as new legislation since the Development Loan Act, 1972, cannot be suitably amended to increase the amount of loans to be raised. The Bill follows substantially the provisions of the Development Loan Act, 1972, except that the maximum sum to be raised under the Bill is $5,000 million instead of $2,000 million under the Development Loan Act, 1972.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin: Mr Speaker, Sir, I have only two points to raise. The first point is this. According to the Explanatory Statement, the cost of servicing the loan will amount to something in the region of $675 million per annum. That works out to 13.5 per cent of the principal sum. This appears to me to be rather high. I wonder what sort of investments we are going to put our money into, and whether the returns will be sufficient to cover what\n\nappears to be a rather high cost of servicing the loan.\n\nThe second point is that, as notice of the Third Reading of the Bill has been given, there was a press report of Government's intention to pass this Bill. I think it did cause quite a bit of alarm publicly - that this is possibly another measure to further squeeze local credit. But the Minister has just indicated that this amount could be raised in the course of the next five years. I am just wondering whether this, in fact, would be used as a sort of a credit squeeze measure.\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the Member for Jalan Kayu and this House that the intention of the Development Loan Bill is not to impose a credit squeeze upon the economy. I am quite aware that there has been some anxiety in the past, whether or not this Bill, in fact, has that intention. But this Bill is quite clearly of the same nature as the Development Loan Act, 1972, which enables us to raise money for development purposes. The idea is that we will require this amount of $5,000 million over the next five years on the basis that we will want to keep the growth rate of the Singapore economy at over 10 per cent per annum, which I hope it will be possible to achieve.\n\nThe point has been raised that the cost of servicing is on the high side. 1 should like to explain that this includes not only interest but also repayment of capital. Most of our loans are of five years' duration and also of longer terms, so that if the interest rate is of the order of six or seven per cent, then the balance is only about six or seven per cent which represents a repayment of capital over the period of the loan.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. NATIONAL POLICE CADET CORPS BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n5.32 p.m.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe Police Cadet Corps movement was established in 1961 when the Police Cadet Corps Act (Chapter 77 of the Revised Edition) came into operation, under the auspices of the Ministry of Home Affairs. In 1963, the responsibility for all the four cadet corps, namely, the Police, Army, Sea and Air Cadet Corps, was transferred to the Ministry of Education.\n\nWhen Singapore became an independent nation in 1965, the need to expand the cadet movement in schools to revitalise and re-orientate our youth in schools became a matter of necessity and urgency. Members may recall that when moving the Second Reading of the National Cadet Corps Bill in November, 1972, it was indicated that steps would be taken to update the Police Cadet Corps Act to bring it in line with the main provisions of the National Cadet Corps Act. Hence this National Police Cadet Corps Bill before this House today.\n\nThis updating of the Police Cadet Corps Act to place it on the same footing as the National Cadet Corps is necessary in the interest of the Corps as both these organisations are playing equally important roles in imbuing their members with a sense of loyalty for the establishment of a national identity.\n\nFurthermore, the updating of the Police Cadet Corps Act is necessary to remove the existing anomaly where there appears to be a dual control of the organisation by both the Ministry of Education and the Police. The establishment of a Council, with three nominees of the Commissioner of Police as members, one of whom shall be the Deputy Chairman, will enable the\n\nPolice to continue to play an equally significant role in the administration and control of the Corps as has been hitherto the case. And quite rightly it should be so, as the Police will continue to provide manpower, logistics and training support for the furtherance of the movement.\n\nWith the enactment of the National Police Cadet Corps Bill, the Corps will gain in status, stature and strength and will no doubt continue to strive for better service to our youth and attain its aims at their highest level.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill -[Mr Ahmad Mattar].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n5.40 p.m.\n\nMr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, the reasons for the Bill are to be found in the recital in the Bill itself. The Bill seeks to incorporate the Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Singapore as a body corporate with perpetual\n\nsuccession and a corporate seal and with powers to acquire, hold and dispose of movable and immovable property, to sue and be sued and to perform all such acts and things as bodies corporate may by law perform.\n\nThe Bill will vest in the corporation all the movable and immovable properties situate in Singapore which were conveyed or assigned to or vested in The Titular Roman Catholic Bishop of Malacca incorporated under the Roman Catholic Bishop Ordinance (Chapter 314 of the 1955 Edition).\n\nThe Bill will repeal the said Roman Catholic Bishop Ordinance and also make provision for the transfer of the rights, obligations and liabilities of The Titular Roman Catholic Bishop of Malacca to the corporation.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time.\n\nResolved,\n\n\"That the Roman Catholic Archbishop Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection.\"-[Mr P. Selvadurai]. RECLAMATION AT PULAU ULAR, PULAU BUKOM KECHIL AND PULAU BUKOM BESAR: 5.42 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper. * The motion reads as follows:\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves\n\n(a) the reclamation of Pulau Ular of 77.70 acres as shown coloured orange and marked `Z' on the plan marked `LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 4/74\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore;\n\n(b) the reclamation of a total of approximately 48.64 acres of the foreshore and seabed at Pulau Bukom Kechil as shown coloured pink and grey and marked `P' and `Y' respectively on the same plan; and\n\n(c) the construction of the various foreshore structures on Pulau Ular, Pulau Bukom Kechil and Pulau Bukom Besar as shown coloured blue, brown (marked `Q', `R', `5', `U', `V' and `X') and purple (marked `T') respectively on the same plan.\n\nSir, Messrs. Shell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd. is embarking on a $600 million expansion project at Pulau Bukom Besar and Pulau Bukom Kechil. The project provides, inter alia, for the construction of a Chemical Complex to manufacture aromatic chemicals, i.e, benzene, toulene and xylene together with storage and loading facilities. It will be undertaken in two phases over a period of three years and is expected to provide employment for some 3,000 workers and on its completion, permanent employment to some 200 persons.\n\nDue to the magnitude of the proposed complex and the limited land area available on the two islands, it is proposed to reclaim approximately 77.70 acres around Pulau Ular as shown coloured orange and marked `Z' on the plan marked as \"LAND OFFICE REXCLAMATION PLAN NO. 4/74\", a copy of which is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of hon. Members. Pulau Ular, located north-west of Pulau Bukom Besar, is actually a submerged reef with two visible islets as shown coloured green on the plan. One-third of the fill for this reclamation will be obtained from hillocks in Pulau Bukom Besar whilst the remaining two-thirds and granite blocks will be obtained from Pulau Ubin. The reclamation, which is scheduled to commence in mid-1975 and to be completed in January, 1978, is expected to cost about $15 million. Ancillary to this reclamation, three fore-shore structures - a bridge connecting Pulau Ular with Pulau Bukom Besar, `a jetty to berth tankers at the northern end of Pulau Ular and a material ramp will be constructed at Pulau Ular. These structures are shown coloured blue on the plan.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Head, Anti-Pollution Unit, an impounding basin to provide anti-pollution measures on both Pulau Bukom Besar and Pulau Bukom Kechil (in view of the large crude oil storage capacity on these islands) was constructed on an urgent basis in Pulau Bukom Kechil by\n\nreclaiming about 20.60 acres of the fore-shore and seabed at the island as shown coloured pink and marked `P' on the plan. It is now proposed to reclaim another 28.04 acres of the foreshore and seabed at Pulau Bukom Kechil as shown coloured grey and marked `Y' on the plan for siting of additional oil tanks. Fill for this reclamation will be obtained from site clearings on Pulau Bukom Besar. The reclamation which will commence at the end of this year is expected to take about a year to complete at an estimated cost of $2.2 million.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, due to the need to provide urgently essential ancillaries to the refinery operations, the following structures were constructed on Pulau Bukom Besar without first obtaining Parliamentary approval under section 4 of the Foreshores Act: -\n\n(a) Vehicle Landing Ramp (marked `Q' on the plan);\n\n(b) Pipe tracks from Wharf 3 to Wharf 6 (marked `T');\n\n(c) Second Bridge between Pulau Bukom Besar and Pulau Bukom Kechil (marked `R');\n\n(d) Materials Jetty Landing Ramp (marked `S'). Covering approval of this House is now sought for the construction of these structures.\n\nOn completion of the reclamation, the reclaimed land will be proclaimed as State land and alienated to Shell on terms and conditions to be agreed with the Commissioner of Lands.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves -\n\n(a) the reclamation of Pulau Ular of 77.70 acres as shown coloured orange and marked `Z' on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE REXCLAMATION PLAN NO. 4/74\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore;\n\n(b) the reclamation of a total of approximately 48.64 acres of the fore-shore and seabed at Pulau Bukom Kechil as shown coloured pink and grey and marked `P' and `Y' respectively on the same plan; and\n\n(c) the construction of the various fore-shore structures on Pulau Ular, Pulau Bukom Kechil and Pulau Bukom Besar as shown coloured blue, brown (marked `Q', `R', `S', `U', `V' and `X') and purple (marked `T') respectively on the same plan. RECLAMATION AT PASIR PANJANG ROAD/WEST COAST ROAD: 5.48 p.m.\n\nMr E. W. Barker: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper. * The motion reads as follows:\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation of those portions of the foreshore and swampland at Pasir Panjang Road/West Coast Road containing an approximate area of 98 acres and 122 acres respectively as shown edged red on the plan marked as \" LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 5/74\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.\n\nYou may recall, Sir, that the reclamation of about 228 acres of foreshore at Pasir Panjang has so far been approved by this House. A plan marked as \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 5/74\", which is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of hon. Members, shows the various phases of the reclamation. As an extension of this reclamation, the Housing and Development Board now proposes to reclaim another 98 acres of the foreshore and 122 acres of swampland at Pasir Panjang Road/West Coast Road 8 1/2 m.s, as shown edged red on the plan. The proposal will complete the plan for reclamation at Pasir Panjang and link it up with Jurong Town Corporation's own reclamation at Jurong. It will also enable the early construction of a new coastal road linking Pasir Panjang Road at about 5 1/2 ms, to Jurong. The proposed reclamation is estimated to cost about $7 million including earth works, and will be carried out in late 1974 or early next\n\nyear in conjunction with the proposed development of the Clementi New Town to the north, using surplus earth therefrom as fill. The reclaimed area north of the proposed coastal road will probably be used for public housing as part of the Clementi New Town, while that to the south between the coastal road and the new foreshore will probably be used for marine industries or for port use.\n\nHowever, the final use of the reclaimed land will be decided by the Master Plan Committee after all claims of the relevant authorities have been studied. Clearance and resettlement of those affected by the proposed reclamation will be undertaken by the Resettlement Department in accordance with its current policy.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation of those portions of the foreshore and swampland at Pasir Panjang Road/West Coast Road containing an approximate area of 98 acres and 122 acres respectively as shown edged red on the plan marked as \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 5/74\", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.
