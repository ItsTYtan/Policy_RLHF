Govindasamy (Telok Blangah) - from 15th to 17th July, 1973.\n\nMr Phua Bah Lee (Tampines) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence - from 24th July to 4th August, 1973.\n\nMr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar), Prime Minister on 25th July. 1973.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol) from 25th July to 1st August, 1973.\n\nYEOH GHIM SENG Speaker, Parliament of Singapore\n\n[MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR] ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS METRICATION (Progress)\n\n1. Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Science and Technology\n\nwhat progress has been made in the implementation of the metric system, and which Government departments and businesses in the private sector have converted to metric.\n\nThe Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr Speaker, Sir, since the White Paper entitled\n\n\"Report on a Study of the Proposed Conversion to the Metric System in Singapore\" was submitted to Parliament in November, 1970, we have achieved as much progress as we could. On the whole, the measures we have recommended in the White Paper have been adopted. The Metrication Board has concentrated its initial efforts in introducing metrication to Government departments and statutory bodies. It has more or less been completed, and the Metrication Board is now directing its attention to the private sector, including the industries and the retail trade.\n\nAmong the measures which have been adopted for metrication is documentation by the Trade Division, the Department of Customs and Excise, and the Statistics Department, which requires traders to declare the goods and have their excise duties assessed in metric units. The Post Office too is currently operating in metric units.\n\nAnother programme implemented and which has great impact upon the general public is the introduction of metric units to the various aspects of road transport. The Public Works Department, the Registry of Vehicles, the Police Department and private organisations, such as the Automobile Association of Singapore and the National Safety First Council, were all involved in the planning of a programme for the smooth introduction of speed limits and distance markers in metric units.\n\nRecently, motorists came into contact with metrication when they began to buy petrol in litres. A campaign is currently being planned in August to make motorists accustomed to reading speed limits in kilometres per hour. For this campaign we are seeking the co-operation of petrol pump stations.\n\nIn many government departments, fees and charges for the various services rendered are now based on metric units. The Public Utilities Board, for example, now charges for water in cubic metres. Care has been taken to ensure that these changes do not result in any increase at the expense of the general public.\n\nIn departments where technical matters are involved, the change to metric is a little slower. But the Public Works Department, the Housing and Development Board, and the Public Utilities Board have all finalised their programmes with a target date of 1975, by which time they hope to he completely metricated.\n\nThe bulk of the metrication programme is still in the planning stage. Nevertheless, packaging of paints in metric units was introduced in July, 1972, and the Metrication Board is likewise looking into similar conversions for other packaged goods.\n\nIn the construction industry, which is affected to a great extent by the building activities in the private sector, metric conversion programmes for bricks, various types of tiles, pre-cast hollow blocks, reinforced steel bars and sawn timber, were completed. In all cases it is the policy of the Government to give whatever support it could provide, such as restricting the purchase of materials for use by the public sector to those designed in metric.\n\nThe introduction of the metric units to the retail trade, however, will be gradual so as not to cause the lay public any undue hardship. Moreover, it will need time to educate the lay public on the metric system. Nevertheless, the sale of textiles by the metre was introduced in March 1972, on the initiative of the Chambers of Commerce themselves. This has now become the widespread practice among the larger departmental stores.\n\nMr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to express my congratulations to the Minister for the success he has achieved through his department in the implementation of the metric system. The Minister just now mentioned the adoption and completion of metrication programmes by various departments. I would like to ask the Minister\n\nwhether he is prepared in the coming weeks to introduce metrication to the taxi services.\n\nThe second question is, whether the Minister is aware that certain retailers have not yet adopted the metric system. Can the Minister see to it that retailers do not try to cheat the public when measuring out the goods to the public? If such cases are found out, what measures will the Minister adopt to deal with such retailers?\n\nDr Toh Chin Chye: Mr Speaker, I think I made it very clear that the general public in Singapore is not accustomed yet to comprehending the metric units used either for distances, or weights, or for other measures. Therefore, it will require time to reinterpret how long is a mile in terms of kilometres; how heavy is a kilogram in terms of a kati, and so on. For this reason, we have no specific programme to involve the conversion of taximeters into the metric system. However, sometime in the future, by 1975 or a little later we hope that the passenger as well as taxi driver will have been used to the metric system, and therefore it will then be possible to change the taxi-meter to the metric system.\n\nOn the retail trade, I do not think it is possible to abandon customary measures so soon. Amahs and housewives who go to market are more accustomed to buying goods in terms of katis and tahils. It will be very foolish of us if we were to insist on an immediate change of their purchases to the kilogram when they do not know how many kilograms are equal to a kati. It is in this transitional period that we have to exercise extreme caution; otherwise we will find that retailers will make use of this opportunity to exploit housewives and consumers. Hence, we have deliberately said in the White Paper that as far as the private sector is concerned, particularly in the retail trade area, we will go slow on metrication until the people of Singapore are more educated in the metric system.\n\nCOMPENSATIONS FOR RESETTLEMENT (Request for increase)\n\n2. Mr Ho Kah Leong asked the Minister for Law and National Development, in view of the rising cost of living, if the Government will consider increasing the rate of ex-gratia compensations payable to eligible families affected by resettlement.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, the rising cost of living was taken into consideration when the rate of ex-gratia compensation for people affected by resettlement was substantially increased by as much as over 100 per cent in July 1971. The resettlement policy is under constant review. At present a committee is studying the position and is expected to make its recommendations to the Government soon.\n\nMr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said that a committee will submit its suggestions to the Government. I wish to ask the Minister how soon will it be? As far as I know, the farmers do not have enough funds to build their new houses. Therefore, will the Minister be able to give more compensations as soon as possible?\n\nMr Barker: Sir, I expect the committee to submit its report within a week's time, when their recommendations will he made to the Government. Whether or not the committee will recommend increased rates, I do not know. I will have to wait for one week.\n\nFARMERS (Subsidy for sanitary amenities)\n\n3. Mr Ho Kah Leong asked the Minister for Law and National Development if the Government will consider subsidising the small farmers, who are financially weak, in the construction of sanitary amenities according to required specifications, so that pollution of water\n\nsources can be prevented and the farmers can still carry on their means of livehood.\n\nMr Barker: Sir, in an open economy like Singapore's, with no hinterland, the Government cannot subsidise any particular sector of the economy. Small farmers should get together to form more efficient farming units, by sharing the cost of sanitary amenities in order to prevent water pollution.\n\nLarge scale pig farming is also more efficient, as it reduces overheads, that is to say, by buying animal feed in bulk, employing less workers to look after pigs, lower cost of veterinary services, and other economies of scale, which have made the big scale pig farmers more prosperous.\n\nSmall scale farming must lose out to more efficient large scale farming. So the small farmers must either get together or face unequal competition and be relentlessly on the losing side.\n\nMr Ho Kah Leong(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said in his reply that it is advisable for small farmers to gang up together to pay for all these sanitary facilities. I would like to inform the Minister that because of geographical and other reasons, it is impossible for small farmers to form larger units. I would like to ask the Minister whether he is prepared to set up a committee to look into the matter of reducing the difficulties of these small farmers.\n\nMr Barker: Sir, in connection with the Kranji/Pandan Reservoir, a committee has, in fact, been set up about three months ago to look into the problems of farmers who will be affected by this scheme. This committee comprises some high-ranking civil servants from my Ministry and the Ministry of the Environment, and it is headed by the Minister of State for the Environment. However, the committee has not completed its investigations and deliberations; but I expect to receive another report soon. By \"soon\", I do not mean next week; it will probably take a month or two.\n\nJURONG TOWN REGISTRATION FOR PRIMARY I ADMISSIONS (Proximity to homes for resident children)\n\n4. Mr Ho Kah Leong asked the Minister for Education what steps the Government proposes to take to ensure that children living in Jurong Town and registered for admission to Primary One classes in 1974 will not be placed in schools far away from Jurong Town.\n\nThe Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng): Mr Speaker, Sir, the actual number of children who have registered for Primary I classes in Jurong for 1974 will not he known until the current registration exercise is completed in August. There are more than 1,200 Primary I places available in Jurong area, and this figure is estimated to be sufficient to meet the requirements of the residents there. However, should there be a further demand, some classrooms in the new secondary school can be temporarily utilised to accommodate the extra requirements until the new primary school for Jurong Town Neighbourhood II is ready in the beginning of 1975.\n\nMr Ho Kah Leong(In Mandarin): Sir, I would like to ask whether the secondary school in Jurong could be completed by the end of this year so that from next year onwards it will be able to take in new students.\n\nDr Lee Chiaw Meng: Yes, Mr Speaker.\n\nAPPLICATIONS FOR SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP (Particulars)\n\n5. Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Health and Home Affairs how many persons applied for Singapore citizenship during the year ended 28th February, 1973; how many of the applications were approved; and how many of them were rejected, and the reasons therefor.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin): Mr Speaker, Sir, the total number of applications received under all Articles of the Constitution during the year ending 28th February, 1973 was 9,068. The number of applications approved and rejected during the same period was 3,572 and 139 respectively.\n\nThe reasons for refusal include the following:-\n\n(a) residentially not qualified;\n\n(b) failed National Language test;\n\n(c) character defects;\n\n(d) of no economic benefit;\n\n(e) no family roots in Singapore.\n\nMr Teong Eng Siong (in Mandarin): Sir, I would like to ask a supplementary question. What is the meaning of \"no family roots in Singapore\"?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, it means what it says. To explain further, if the Member for Sembawang has not understood it, it means that the applicant is the only person here, and, that he has not got a wife, children, brothers and sisters who are Singapore citizens.\n\nMr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah): Mr Speaker, may I know whether the Minister will allow an applicant's wife and children who are residing in other countries to come and join him so as to enable him to apply for citizenship?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Sir, the answer is no, because he must first have residential qualifications before he can apply for citizenship.\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Sir, assuming the applicant has got residential qualifications, hut because his family has been staying in other countries, then the Government could use the reason against the applicant, in which case he will never get citizenship. Is it not so?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a hypothetical question based on certain assumptions. I would rather prefer the Member for Bras Basah to quote a specific case, when I can deal with it on its own merits. But having got a general question, I will\n\ngive a general answer. The point is this. If a person is residentially qualified, of course, he can apply. But whether he will be granted citizenship is another matter.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah): Sir, should one have a family to be a citizen? What about the case of a confirmed bachelor?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Sir, I do not know what is the motive behind that question; of course, we encourage only two children per family. However, when I say \"family roots\", I do not only mean wife and children, but also brothers and sisters, mother, father, uncles, and so on.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: Sir, are we going to deprive a single person of citizenship if he has got no parents, or no children?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not a question of deprivation of citizenship. It is a question of a person applying for citizenship. If he has not got any citizenship, how can we deprive him of citizenship?\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy (Anson): Sir, assuming a person has got all the qualifications for citizenship, can the Minister tell us whether or not he will be granted citizenship?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Sir, if he has all the qualifications which I have outlined, of course, he will be granted citizenship.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy: Mr Speaker, Sir, since so many applications have been rejected, would the Minister like to enlighten the House on the reasons?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already said that if a Member has any specific case in view, he can bring it to my attention and I will consider it on its merits. I do not think it is helpful to make a general statement that certain applications have been rejected.\n\nMr Teong Eng Siong(In Mandarin): Sir, I am not satisfied with one of the reasons given by the Minister. I hope\n\nthe Minister will reconsider the reason. At the moment we are encouraging small families. We do not encourage more than two children in the family.\n\nMr Speaker: Mr Teong, are you asking a supplementary question, or are you entering into a debate on this subject?\n\nMr Teong Eng Siong(In Mandarin): Therefore, we should consider giving citizenship to bachelors. Otherwise, it seems that we are encouraging them to marry and to have many children.\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Sir, I am here to answer questions, and not statements. So I cannot answer the Member for Sembawang.\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister whether there has been any change in the criteria adopted in deciding on the economic benefit of an applicant.\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been a change. If the Member could recall, recently there was a statement by the Ministry of Labour to the effect that applicants who are skilled workmen and can add to our industrialisation effort, and if they could pass a trade test and possess the 10-year residential qualification, they would be granted citizenship straightaway.\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS (Particulars)\n\n6. Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Health and Home Affairs how many persons were detained for illegal entry into Singapore during the year ended 28th February. 1973; and what action the Government has taken or intends to take to stop further illegal entries.\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, a total of 1,693 persons were detained for illegal entry into Singapore for the period 1st March. 1972 to 28th February, 1973.\n\nThe Immigration Department on receipt of information, mounts surprise\n\nchecks and raids. The Marine Police also keep a lookout for suspicious-looking vessels trying to sneak in with illegal immigrants. Members of the Police Force who are on beat duty carry out frequent checks on suspicious-looking persons who may have entered Singapore illegally. Further, Immigration and Police Officers conduct surprise checks at the various worksites. When arrested, illegal immigrants are detained, prosecuted and removed after serving their sentences.\n\nAt present a person who enters Singapore illegally can be imprisoned for a term not exceeding one year or fined up to a sum not exceeding $4,000, or to both such imprisonment and fine. A trafficker can be imprisoned for two years and fined up to $4,000. These penalties are inadequate especially for traffickers who prey on these illegal immigrants. The Immigration Act will be amended to increase the penalties for illegal immigrants and especially for traffickers, who could be punished by caning as a deterrent against making money out of encouraging illegal immigration.\n\nA special unit has just been established in the Immigration Department to deal solely with the problem of illegal immigration.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has told us the number of illegal entries into Singapore. Can the Minister check up and let us know how many of these cases are new?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot answer the Member for Anson because I have not got the figures. If the Member for Anson were to submit a question, I will give him accurate figures. But what I can say now is that the number has increased since the period ending 28th February, 1973.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy: Mr Speaker, Sir, my question is: with two million people in Singapore, how could he check who are the illegal immigrants? Does he check them when they come into Singapore?\n\nMr Chua Sian Chin: Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Anson had listened to me carefully, he would have got the answer. BILLS INTRODUCED: 3.00 p.m. MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING AND PYRAMID SELLING (PROHIBITION) BILL\n\n\"to prohibit the registration of businesses that are designed to promote multi-level marketing schemes or arrangements or pyramid selling schemes or arrangements in relation to the distribution and sale of commodities; to prohibit the incorporation or registration of companies which propose to promote multi-level marketing schemes or arrangements or pyramid selling schemes or arrangements in relation to the distribution and sale of commodities and to make it unlawful for any person to promote such schemes or arrangements and to provide for matters connected therewith\",\n\npresented by the Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen) read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Companies Act (Chapter 185 of the Revised Edition)\",\n\npresented by Mr Hon Sui Sen; read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available silting of Parliament, and to be printed. SECURITIES INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Securities Industry Act, 1973 (No. 17 of 1973)\",\n\npresented by Mr Hon Sui Sen; read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. NATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.02 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend section 16 of the National Productivity Board Act to provide for the accounts of the Board to be audited by the Auditor-General or by an auditor appointed annually by the Minister in consultation with the Auditor-General. Besides spelling out the powers of the auditor, it also deals with the Boards financial year, the financial procedure to he adopted and preparation and publication of annual financial statements and reports. It provides that a copy of the audited financial statements and of the report of the auditor shall he presented to Parliament, and hence be subject to the scrutiny of the Public Accounts Committee where necessary. These amendments are aimed at placing the accountability of the Board on a more firm footing.\n\nThe Bill also introduces a new section 23 which will grant the Board an exclusive right to the use of a symbol as set out in the Schedule to the Act. Any infringement of this right will render the person liable to a fine exceeding $1,000.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Ong Pang Boon]\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. EMPLOYMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.05 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, during the legislative reform of 1968, certain management rights and functions, including the right to hire and fire, were restored to employers. Generally, employers have\n\nproved worthy of the trust placed upon them and have exercised the powers restored to them in a fair and responsible manner. There are, however, some irresponsible employers who are abusing these powers by dismissing employees without just cause or excuse. Where the dismissed employees are represented by trade unions, adequate redress is provided under the Industrial Relations Act which empowers the Minister to order reinstatement or payment of compensation if, after due inquiry, he is of the opinion that the dismissal was without just cause or excuse. Such redress, however, is not available to non-unionised employees. At present, all that the Commissioner for Labour can do is to order the employer to pay a salary in lieu of notice of termination which can only amount to a maximum of four weeks' pay depending on the length of service of the employee concerned. This is clearly no deterrent to those employers bent on maximising profits without any regard for the well being of their employees.\n\nHon. Members will no doubt agree with me that a non-unionised employee is as much entitled to protection against unjust dismissal as his unionised counterpart. Clause 2 of the Bill, therefore, seeks to provide that where an employee has been dismissed by his employer on ground of misconduct, he has a right to refer his case to the Minister if his dismissal was wrongful. The Minister will be empowered to order the reinstatement of the employee or to order the employer to pay compensation if, after due inquiry, he is satisfied that the dismissal was wrongful. Responsible and fair-minded employers will have nothing to fear, as the amendment is directed against the irresponsible amongst them.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, there is also a need to prevent exploitation of children and young persons, especially in the context of a tight labour market. Presently, a person who employs a child or young person without a Certificate of Registration issued by the Commissioner or contrary to the conditions set out in the certificate may, on conviction, be fined a sum not exceeding $500 or sentenced\n\nto imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both. As imprisonment has never been imposed by the Court, the maximum penalty of $500 is, therefore, not sufficiently deterrent and, of late, there is a growing tendency among employers to engage children and young persons to work in factories and other industrial establishments with scant regard for their safety and health at the work place. Members will agree with me that, notwithstanding the requirements of industries, our obligation must be to ensure that high standards of health and safety prevail in establishments employing children and young persons. Since employers must be deterred from employing young workers without regard for their health and safety, the maximum fine will be increased from $500 to $2,000 by clause 7 of the Bill. Also, where a child or young person suffers serious injury or death arising from a contravention of the provisions of the Employment Act, the Court shall, upon the coming into force of this Bill, impose a mandatory fine of $2,000.\n\nLast October, my colleague, the Minister for Health, outlined in his Ministerial Statement in Parliament the measures to be taken to encourage family planning. One of these measures calls for the curtailment of paid maternity leave for employees in both the public and private sectors from three to two confinements with effect from 1st August this year. For employees in the public sector, appropriate amendments to the Instruction Manuals have been made by the Ministry of Finance. As for the private sector, clause 19 of this Bill seeks to provide that a female employee will not be entitled to any pay when she absents herself from work during a confinement if at the time of confinement she has two or more surviving children. This clause also supersedes whatever agreement that may be provided under any existing collective agreements insofar as they provide for better or more favourable maternity benefits.\n\nThere are, however, three compensatory aspects of clause 19 which deserve\n\nspecial mention. Firstly, maternity benefits as provided under Part X of the Act are presently only applicable to female workmen. These statutory entitlements will now he extended by clause 19 to all female employees. This amendment ensures that all female employees will be well taken care of up to two confinements, thereby safeguarding the health of both mother and child.\n\nSecondly, the present Act provides that a female workman is entitled to paid maternity leave four weeks before and four weeks after her confinement. If she gives birth prematurely, i.e, before the estimated date of delivery, she will not be able to enjoy the four weeks of paid maternity leave before her confinement. This will now be amended by clause 19 which provides that where a female employee has worked in her employment for any day during the period of four weeks immediately before her confinement, she shall be entitled to receive, in addition to her ordinary rate of pay for that day, an amount equivalent to a day's pay or to absent herself from work on another day at the end of her benefit period. In other words, every female employee is entitled to the full maternity leave of eight weeks or pay in lieu of any portion of such leave.\n\nThirdly, the present Act provides that a female workman will forfeit in toto her maternity benefits if she fails to give proper notice of confinement to her employer. This is unduly harsh especially where failure to give notice is due to genuine ignorance of the legal requirement on the part of the female workman concerned. Clause 19, therefore, seeks to provide that where a female employee fails to give proper notice of confinement to her employer, she will still he entitled to one half of the maternity benefits.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n3.15 p.m.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: Mr Speaker, Sir, I read with considerable interest\n\nthe Employment (Amendment) Bill. I am particularly interested in clause 2 of the Bill. To begin with, this clause seeks to introduce a form of procedure whereby a worker or an employee within the definition of the original Act may seek reinstatement in his former employment if he can satisfy the Minister that he has been dismissed from service without just cause or excuse by his employer.\n\nSir, as the Minister has pointed out, a similar procedure is found in section 35 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act. The only difference, of course, under section 35 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, is that a worker who is aggrieved by his dismissal must make representation in writing to the Minister through his union, whereas under the provisions of the proposed amendment to the Employment Act he need not he a member of a union. We, in the NTUC, have in the past always regarded a worker, who is eligible to seek membership in the union but who refrains from joining a union, as a parasite in our society. Mr Speaker, Sir, from our point of view, the proposed procedure in clause 2 of the Bill is objectionable. You will agree with me, Sir, that in legislating matters which are interrelated, there should be some uniformity. Both the Employment Act and the Industrial Relations Act are pieces of legislation governing the relationship between the employer and the employee. I do hope that clause 2 of the Bill, which introduces a new section 14 in the Employment Act, could he amended at page 2, lines 7 and 8 of the Bill, to ensure that any representation to the Minister for reinstatement arising from a wrongful dismissal can be made only through a union and not otherwise. However, I do realise that it may be desirable to make suitable provisions in exceptional cases, such as dismissals of a prospective union member who may be engaged in organising workers in his place of employment or in cases where recognition of the union is withheld by the employer for lack of majority.\n\nAt this juncture, Sir, it would be relevant for me to draw the attention of the House to the need to consider introducing a clear and definite form of procedure in dealing with the merits of the representation for reinstatement. However, to understand and appreciate what I am about to propose, one has to go back to the year 1965. At the end of that year, Sir, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act, 1965, was passed. One of the most important amendments was the granting of specific powers to the Industrial Arbitration Court to order the reinstatement of a dismissed employee. This power was removed in 1968 by a further amendment to the Industrial Relations Act. And now, Sir, only in cases of victimisation does the Court have the power to reinstate.\n\nAs a result of the restrictions placed on the Court's power to deal with dismissal cases, the only remedy available in the case of wrongful dismissal is that provided under section 35 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act. In the early stages following the amendment in 1968, a few inquiries were held at the Labour Court in the Labour Ministry, presided over by an officer appointed for that purpose. Witnesses were allowed to be called by both parties and could testify at the inquiry. To some extent the proceedings at such an inquiry, though informal, were well regulated and were quite satisfactory. For the past three years, however, no inquiries of such a nature have been held. Instead, when representation is made for reinstatement, Labour Ministry officials call for the parties separately and make their recommendations thereafter. In trade union circles, dismissal as a form of punishment, especially to a worker who has put in many years of service, is analogous to a death sentence as it is the supreme form of punishment. Nor shall we confine our attention only to the dismissed worker who may well be either the sole breadwinner or the main provider in his family. So, Mr Speaker, Sir, by one injudicious act an employer can inflict punishment on a group of innocent persons. It is, therefore, necessary for\n\nus when dealing with dismissal cases to extend our consideration to the family unit as well.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, allow me to deal with the relevant provisions in clause 2. In the proposed section 14 (1) (b), the employer is given the right to suspend a worker without payment of salary for a period not exceeding one week. This is a re-enactment of the existing provision. From experience, Sir, very few employers observe the provision to suspend a worker for one week. What they normally do is to hold an inquiry of their own. They make their own investigation without giving an opportunity to the suspended worker to explain or to counter the allegations of misconduct. In some cases, Sir, where the investigation cannot be completed within a week, the employers invariably proceed to dismiss, believing, rightly or wrongly, that if they do not dismiss after one week they might lose the right to dismiss. Even more disturbing, Sir, is the possibility that the employer, being engaged in more urgent business, may not be able to take prompt steps to investigate into the alleged acts of misconduct, and when he finds that the week is coming to an end through his neglect to take steps promptly, he will proceed to dismiss. In matters of this nature, Sir, it is desirable to extend the time where the case requires it. I would suggest that the suspension period for the purpose of an inquiry be one week initially, during which the employee is paid half his salary, with the possible extension of a further week on one quarter of his salary.\n\nI have criticised the procedure adopted by employers by holding inquiries in the form of private investigation without the worker being given a chance to explain. We have found that there are always two versions to a story. In such an important matter as dismissal, there can be no justice unless the worker, against whom allegations of misconduct are made, is given a fair opportunity to state his case. In addition, he must be allowed to be represented by a union representative of his own choice and be allowed to contest the testimony of\n\npersons who have made statements against him. In other words, we consider that it is not only desirable but necessary that an employee, against whom allegations of misconduct are made, should be given the chance to confront witnesses from the management side who have made statements against him. I suggest, Sir, that the worker must also he given the opportunity to call any witnesses he considers necessary to testify on his behalf. Justice, Sir, must not only be done but also seen to be done.\n\nThe suggested procedure, as mentioned by me earlier, is particularly necessary following representations to the Minister for reinstatement following a wrongful dismissal. I observe that the Commissioner for Labour will he entrusted with the duty to inquire into the dismissal and to make the necessary report to the Minister. The suggested procedure I mentioned earlier should he followed each time the Commissioner carries out an investigation into a dismissal case referred to him by the Minister. The present procedure under the industrial Relations Act - that of meeting union representatives and management representatives separately has proved to be unsatisfactory. If this procedure is allowed to continue, the confidence of workers in the Labour Ministry will be shaken. And if confidence is shaken, it is not likely for the workers to refer their grievances, especially in dismissal cases, to the Labour Ministry. In the ultimate, it will lead to a situation which the House can imagine - how much industrial unrest it will cause! Mr Speaker, Sir, 1 am sure that that is not the intention of this legislation, and I urge that the most serious consideration be given to the points I have raised.\n\n3.28 p.m.\n\nMr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the views expressed by the Member for Telok Blangah.\n\nThe Employment Act and the Industrial Relations Act were implemented since 1968, which impose several restrictions on the workers, one of which is that employers have the right to promote, to transfer, to reorganise, to dismiss, or to retrench their employees. At that time the workers accepted these restrictions so as to help to create a good climate for investors to come to Singapore, and thereby provide employment for our people. Since 1968 Singapore has been enjoying industrial peace and today we are experiencing an economic boom with full employment. I am proud to say that, with the guidance of the NTUC and various trade union leaders, the workers in Singapore have conducted themselves very well and have maintained the continuity of industrial peace which, of course, helps to preserve the present political and economic stability. The workers and the union leaders have acted in a very intelligent and reasonable way towards the employers when dealing with the various industrial disputes. Unfortunately, some stupid and unreckoned employers mistook our reasonableness to be our weakness.\n\nThere is a limit to everything. If employers still continue to take advantage of the labour laws by dismissing and retrenching workers and union leaders and to subtly victimise them so as to weaken the strength and unity of the trade union movement, then I suggest that the employers' right to dismiss and to retrench employees should be taken away from the Employment Act and the Industrial Relations Act. Why should the workers be made to suffer and to sacrifice all the time? Sir, I would like to read part of the editorial from the Labour News of July 1973, published by SILO and PIEU, expressing concern over employers retrenching employees in order to cow the workers from becoming union leaders and to weaken the union. I quote:\n\n`Recent events showed that the hidden sharp point of the instrument of retrenchment is used by employers to get rid of branch committee officials; in a few instances, the retrenchment exercises have knifed off as many as half the total number of branch committee officials. In the first place, such retrenchment exercises are, basically, for the purpose of\n\nbreaking up the branch committees and to make them impotent. In the second place, they are meant to cow other workers from offering themselves to stand for election or appointment to branch committees; and what is even more serious is the real intention of the employers, and that is, to break the faith and confidence of the rank and file members in the trade union.\n\nWe would ask the Labour Ministry and the NTUC to make a close scrutiny of management's rights of retrenchment which, in practice, can camouflage other insidious intentions, and we hope to see positive results ensuing.'\n\nSir, in view of the fact that some employers are taking advantage of the labour laws against the workers and union leaders by retrenching them so as to weaken the union, I would suggest to the Minister for Labour to deprive the employers of the right to dismiss or retrench their employees. The employers must negotiate with the union leaders before any dismissal or retrenchment of any employees. In fairness to the workers, I suggest that the Employment Act and the Industrial Relations Act should be amended so that employers have no right to dismiss or retrench any employee unless they negotiate with the union.\n\n3.35 p.m.\n\nMr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to comment on three provisions in the Bill to amend the Employment Act. The provisions relate to the amendment of sections 14 and 38 and Parts VIII, IX and X of the Employment Act.\n\nI should like to make it clear right from the very beginning that I am wholly in favour of the proposed amendments. Some of the proposed provisions, however, do not seem to have fully dealt with every aspect of the matters under amendment; and it is with regard to some of these aspects that I wish to seek clarification.\n\nThe intention of clause 2 of the Bill, touching upon section 14 of the Employment Act, is apparently to bring the Employment Act into line with the Industrial Relations Act, as the proposed provisions are substantially the same as the corresponding provisions in\n\nsection 35 of the Industrial Relations Act. I am inclined to agree that there is a need for the proposed provisions. Under Part XVI of the Employment Act, a machinery has been provided for the Commissioner of Labour to inquire into disputes between employers and their employees. But if, in the process of so inquiring, the Commissioner is convinced that an employee has been dismissed without just cause or excuse, the only remedy the Commissioner is empowered to apply to the wrongfully dismissed employee is monetary compensation.\n\nAny sum of money, of course, is useful when a person is out of work but is no compensation for the loss of a steady career, for which he may have already spent half his working life. It is, therefore, only fair and equitable that an employee who has been found to be wrongfully dismissed should be allowed to have his old job back, wherever possible. Reinstatement in employment is, however, a statutory remedy and up to now the Minister has the power to reinstate a person in his former employment only if proceedings for such reinstatement have been initiated through a trade union under the Industrial Relations Act.\n\nIn giving my support to the proposal to incorporate into the Employment Act the power of reinstatement by the Minister, I am particularly struck by two aspects of the proposal. One is that any employee who considers himself to be wrongfully dismissed may apply to the Minister for reinstatement regardless of whether or not he is a member of a trade union which has been accorded recognition by the employer. The other is that the Minister may have recourse to the well-tried machinery of the Labour Court for the purpose of ascertaining the facts of any dismissal before making a decision thereon.\n\nIt is my humble opinion, however, that the proposed provisions may be strengthened in the interest of employees. I wish to suggest that the proposed section 14 (2) of the Employment Act should have the words \"whether with or without notice\" to qualify any dismissal\n\nin respect of which the Minister may be requested to intervene. It must not be forgotten that under the Employment Act, a notice of not more than two weeks is required for the termination of service of an employee with less than five years' service. An employer would have to be exceedingly foolhardy to refuse to give such two weeks' notice which would free him from any anxiety in relation to the proposed provisions.\n\nThe intention of clauses 4 to 18 of the Bill, dealing with Parts VIII and IX of the Employment Act, apparently seeks to strengthen the provisions safeguarding young children from undue exploitation by unscrupulous employers. Of late it has become increasingly noticeable that employers, with bank statements for their conscience, have been engaging children of tender years at a small wage to perform work which is unsuited to their capacity and which taxes their physical strength beyond endurance and reason. For such employers, of course, the attraction of employing children lies in the fact that the children are too young to know better or to be able to fight for a better deal. The savings that can be had by such employers through evading their liabilities under the Employment Act and the Central Provident Fund Act arc tremendous, but they make a mockery of all the statutory provisions enacted or approved by this House for the benefit of workers in general and the protection of young children, in particular. The proposed provisions, therefore, meet an urgent and grave need in that they will be a greater and more effective deterrent against improper employment of young children,\n\nClause 19 of the Bill, amending the whole of Part X of the Employment Act, seeks to remove a long outstanding anomaly in the statutory provisions governing the terms and conditions of workers in Singapore. I should think that the removal of such an anomaly is long overdue. Up to now only female workmen are statutorily entitled to have paid maternity leave during their confinement, that is, one month before and one month after. On the other hand,\n\nother female employees, who are non-workmen, such as clerks, shop assistants, teachers and typists, are not statutorily entitled to one single day's paid maternity leave during their confinement. What has made the situation more tolerable for female employees as a whole is that trade unions have secured paid maternity leave for their members and have incorporated such benefit into a collective agreement, and that enlightened employers such as the Government and the Statutory Board have granted paid maternity leave to their female employees despite the strange omission in the Employment Act. Nonetheless, there is a real need for the proposed amendment as individual female employees, who arc non-workmen engaged by a firm in the private sector without the benefit of representation by a trade union, would otherwise have no cause for complaint if their employers refuse to grant them paid maternity leave.\n\nAs for the restriction of paid maternity leave only to female employees with not more than two living children, I agree that such restriction is rational in accordance with the Government's avowed policy or restricting the size of families in Singapore. Since the ideal size of a family has been widely and recently mooted as that consisting of the two parents themselves and their two children, it makes sense not to offer incentives for employees to have more than two children.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill.\n\n3.40 p.m.\n\nMr Teong Eng Siong (in Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction of this amendment Bill is, in my opinion, very timely in the present context of Singapore. These amendments will ensure that our workers will have better care and protection of the law. This is a progressive piece of legislation.\n\nSir, it cannot be denied that in the past few years industrial relations in Singapore have improved considerably. The number of strikes has been reduced\n\nvisibly and most, if not all, of the industrial disputes have been referred to the Labour Ministry or the Industrial Arbitration Court for reasonable or peaceful settlement. This is something that is very encouraging.\n\nIn this amendment Bill there are also provisions which are favourable to the workers, particularly the female employees. There is a clear-cut provision in the law to ensure that all female employees in Singapore will enjoy equal rights. Of course, I am referring to the maternity leave benefits which will be extended from the female workmen to all female employees. This is only right and proper, because more and more women in entering the labour market are engaged in the factories. According to my estimate, about 30 per cent of the workers in Singapore are female. So it is only reasonable that all female employees should enjoy the same rights and benefits.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, several Members of the House have spoken on this Bill. They have touched on the question of wrongful dismissal and the remedy available to workers who are wrongfully dismissed. They have suggested that there should be proper inquiries to ascertain whether a worker has been wrongfully dismissed, and, if so, to ensure that such a worker is reinstated. But it is not easy to find out whether a worker has been wrongfully dismissed or not. In my view the Ministry of Labour, which is now suffering from a shortage of staff, will find it difficult to conduct comprehensive inquiries into such cases. The Ministry of Labour must have adequate staff to ensure that proper inquiries are conducted, before they can submit their report to the Minister. If there is shortage of staff in the Ministry of Labour, delay is inevitable or the inquiry may be inadequate. This may result in the worker who is wrongfully dismissed not being able to enjoy the full protection of the law, and thereby could lose his employment because of such inadequacies. I would therefore like to remind the Minister concerned that more officers should be engaged to conduct these\n\ninquiries to ensure effective implementation of the provisions in the Act.\n\nMr Ong Pang Boon: Mr Speaker, Sir, all the arguments put forward by the Members for Telok Blangah and Bukit Ho Swee had been gone into thoroughly in 1968 when the present Employment Act was passed in this House. Therefore, I do not propose to repeat the arguments put forward by the Government then, as I think the various points of view have been fully aired both inside and outside this Parliament. Suffice it to say, as a result of the passing of the Employment Act in 1968, there has been rapid economic development and we have been able to attract investments to this country and to solve what was at one time regarded as the insoluble problem of unemployment in Singapore. Today, we need to have a favourable climate for economic development. We also need investments as much as in 1968. For these reasons, the Employment Act will have to remain with us for a long time to come.\n\nAlthough there have been criticisms against the shortcomings of the Employment Act, nevertheless in the overall interest of rapid economic development and in the overall interest of our people, we cannot disband overnight the Employment Act which was introduced in 1968. What we can do is to ensure that the kind of situations brought up by the Members for Telok Blangah and Bukit Ho Swee will be prevented or rectified whenever they occur.\n\nThe Member for Telok Blangah has objected to the provision whereby a non-unionised worker can make representation to the Minister for wrongful dismissal. I am rather surprised that the Member for Telok Blangah should adopt such a selfish attitude. I think a non-unionised worker should be entitled -\n\nMr N. Govindasamy rose -\n\nMr Speaker: Mr Govindasamy, will you let the Minister explain first?\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: Sir, I wish to correct the misunderstanding that the Minister has conceived.\n\nMr Speaker: All right.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: Sir, I have never said that all non-unionised workers should be left out of that provision. Perhaps the Minister was not listening. Let me repeat and quote the exact text of what I have said:\n\n`We in the NTUC have in the past always regarded a worker, who is eligible to seek membership in the union but who refrains from joining the union, as a parasite to our society.'\n\nThese are the people I want to be kept out; not any employee.\n\nMr Ong Pang Boon: In other words, Mr Speaker, Sir, he has admitted that there are sections of workers which cannot be unionised, and therefore they need the protection of this provision. For instance, domestic servants and the large number of construction workers, contract workers, and so on. Obviously they need the protection of this provision in the Amendment Act.\n\nSir, the Member for Telok Blangah has dealt at length with the procedure under the Industrial Relations Act regarding representations of wrongful dismissal. Under the provision of section 35 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, if an employee considers that he has been dismissed without just cause or excuse by his employer, he may make representation through his union to the Minister for reinstatement. The representation is first referred to the Industrial Relations Section to be dealt with on a conciliation basis, and the employer concerned is asked to furnish in writing the circumstances leading to, and grounds for, the dismissal. If, in this informal preliminary inquiry, a prima facie case is not established by the union, then, of course, such representation will be rejected. But if the informal inquiry reveals that the management is partly in the wrong, then efforts will be made to get the parties through ex parte consultation to settle the case either by reinstatement or by cash compensation. If no settlement is reached by conciliation, the representation will be dealt with either under section 35 (3), whereby the Minister directs the Commissioner for Labour to hold a formal inquiry and\n\nto make recommendations to the Minister; or under section 35 (4) where the employer is asked to make written submissions to the Minister to justify his action to dismiss the employee concerned.\n\nSir, as many of the representations are straightforward, the procedures adopted by the Ministry of Labour have proved to be effective and satisfactory. This is borne out by the following facts. Since 15th August, 1968, 109 representations have been received. Of this number, 24 representations were rejected, 52 were settled by conciliation, 23 were withdrawn by the union, three are currently under consideration, and a total of seven cases were disposed of by Ministerial orders, directing four dismissed employees to be reinstated and three employers to pay compensation to three dismissed employees. A total of three formal inquiries were also held under order of the Minister. It is to he noted that each formal inquiry took no less than two and a half months for hearings to be completed. The current procedure of first dealing with union representation by means of conciliation has, therefore, proved to be both expeditious and satisfactory. This same procedure will be adopted in respect of representations made under the new amended section 14 of the Employment Act.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, the Government does not contemplate amending the relevant sections of the Industrial Relations Act at the moment, nor does it intend to accept the suggestions made by the hon. Members in respect of representations by non-unionised employees for wrongful dismissal. A formal hearing, which is not only time-consuming but also involves the full-time services of a good number of Government officers, should only be resorted to when a prima facie case has been established and when all other conciliatory efforts have failed to settle the issue.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole house.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n4.01 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, the Central Provident Fund Act was enacted in 1955 to provide employees in Singapore with a compulsory savings scheme so that they will have some savings when they retire from active work. Since then, the Fund has grown from a membership of 180,000 with accumulated savings of $9 million to more than 911,000 members whose total balance amounts to $1,500 million at the end of June 1973. The Fund is also fulfilling two important social functions. Firstly, under its approved housing scheme introduced in 1968, members are permitted to use their CPF credits to purchase Housing and Development Board fiats. At the end of June 1973, 32,727 members have withdrawn $119 million for this purpose. Secondly, it is an institution for national savings and is one of the most important sources of funds for Government development projects.\n\nThere is, however, one unhealthy and unfortunate development that accompanies the growth of the Fund, namely, a corresponding increase in the number of infringements and offences under the Act. This is especially true whenever the rate of contribution is raised. In 1968, when the employer/employee combined rate of contribution was 13 per cent, only 42 employers were successfully prosecuted for non-payment of contributions and more than $114,000 collected as interest on late payments. In 1972, when the combined rate of contribution was raised to 24 per cent, the number of employers prosecuted increased to\n\n653 and interest on late payments also jumped to $642,000. For the first six months of this year, 314 employers have been successfully prosecuted and $790,000 collected as interest on late payments. As the rates of contribution have been further increased from 1st July this year, it is envisaged that the number of infringements and offences will also increase, unless steps are taken to check this tendency. This is one of the main objectives which the Bill hopes to achieve.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, the aims of this Bill are given in the Explanatory Statement. I will, therefore, only concentrate on the more important provisions.\n\nThe Central Provident Fund Board is facing some difficulties in enforcing the provisions of the Central Provident Fund Act because of its limited powers. At present, officers of the Board are unable to deal effectively with the problem of evasion of CPF contributions, as the Act does not provide specific statutory powers to require employers to produce contracts of service, salary account books, registers and such other documents relating to the employment of their employees. Clause 4 of the Bill, therefore, seeks to provide officers of the Board with the necessary statutory powers to deal with this problem and to strengthen the Board's enforcement machinery.\n\nThe Board is also concerned over the problem of late payments which is mainly due to the existing low penalties. Currently, an employer who pays CPF contributions late can be charged interest of 1 per cent per month on the amount of contribution due or $1 whichever is greater. This rate of interest of 1 per cent per month is not sufficiently deterrent to encourage prompt payment, while the minimum penalty of $1 is administratively unenforceable since a simple registered letter of demand costs 75 cents in postage alone, and many employers simply refuse to pay, knowing that the Central Provident Fund Board is unlikely to take criminal proceedings for such a small sum. Clause 7 of the Bill will, therefore, increase the\n\nrate of interest on late payment to 1 1/2 per cent per month with a minimum penalty of $5. This interest will be charged on a daily basis instead of on a monthly basis in order to encourage employers to pay up promptly as, under the existing provision, an employer is penalised the same amount irrespective of whether he is late by one day or one month.\n\nA more serious problem is where an employer has deducted CPF contributions from the wages of his employees but fails to pay them to the Fund. Currently, the maximum penalties for such an offence are $500 for a first offence and $2,000 for a second and subsequent offence. Though considered to be sufficiently deterrent when the Act was first introduced in 1955, when the combined rate of CPF contribution was only 10 per cent subject to a maximum of $50 per month, these penalties are now manifestly inadequate especially when the combined rate of contributions has just been raised to 26 per cent from 1st July, 1973, in respect of employees earning more than $200 per month. The maximum monthly contribution payable by both employers and employees has also been increased to $225 and $165 respectively, and there is no limit on CPF contributions on bonuses. Large employers of labour will be very tempted to delay payment of CPF contributions which have been deducted from employees' salaries, and utilise this money for other purposes. This, in fact, happened in the case of four Chinese bus companies prior to and immediately after the reorganisation of the public transport system in April 1971.\n\nClause 6, therefore, provides that where an employer has deducted CPF contributions from the wages of his employees but fails to pay such contribution to the Fund within the stipulated time, the employer is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $10,000 or to imprisonment up to seven years, or to both such fine and imprisonment. The interest of the employees will be further protected by clause 16 which enables\n\nthe Board to lay claims on the proceeds from the sale of any property of an employer seized under a writ of seizure.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, the amendments proposed in clauses 5 and 10 are significant as they will empower the Board to make rules prescribing the manner in which interest should be calculated. This will enable the Board to take into account late payments of contributions as though they were not late so that the employees concerned would not suffer a loss of interest. The amendments also enable the Board, if circumstances permit in the future, to credit interest to members of the Fund at half-yearly or quarterly intervals instead of the present yearly intervals.\n\nAnother amendment that deserves mention is contained in clause 11. At present, a member who has withdrawn from the Fund at the age of 55 and carries on working cannot withdraw again until five years later. This may cause some hardship especially if the member is subsequently out of job. Clause 11 will now permit him to withdraw again if he has been unemployed for a period of six months immediately preceding the date he makes an application for a further withdrawal.\n\nSir, to ensure that all employees enjoy the benefits of CPF and employers are prompt in making CPF payments, it is necessary to arm officers of the Central Provident Fund Board with sufficient statutory powers to carry out their duties effectively and to provide for stiffer penalties against recalcitrant employers.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n4.14 p.m.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: Mr Speaker, Sir, as I see it, this Bill which seeks to amend the Central Provident Fund Act is intended to give more teeth to the principal Act. As such, the amendments can benefit workers in general. I have no hesitation in giving my support to it. However, there are some provisions upon which I wish to comment on in some detail.\n\nClause 4 of the Bill, introducing a new section 4A into the principal Act, is, in my opinion, a timely and necessary provision, as the persons charged with enforcing the principal Act have apparently encountered unnecessary difficulties in the absence of the proposed provisions. Human nature being what it is, it is probable that officers of the CPF Board, or the Ministry of Labour for that matter, may have received either downright evasive replies or outright hostile silence from persons to whom their enquiries have been directed. Under the prevailing law, there is no legal obligation for such persons to produce documentary records or to be frank with the investigating officers. In that respect, the proposed provisions should, by helping to make it more difficult for employers to evade their obligations under the principal Act, be of great service to workers.\n\nSome of the proposed provisions, however, may pose a threat to the peace of mind of small employers, particularly the employers of domestic help, whether on a full-time or part-time basis. But before some snide remarks are made about the affluence of Singapore workers who are able to afford domestic help, let me hasten to add that a working couple with one or two children, living completely on their own in a Housing Board fiat, without the benefit of the service of in-laws or the cheap service of a creche, have to employ domestic help out of sheer necessity - that is, work permits from the Ministry of Labour permitting. In such a case, even though the husband may be the official employer in the sense that he may be so described for the purpose of the principal Act or any other statutory enactment, the actual or real employer may be the wife in the sense that she may be the one who deals with the remuneration and decides the terms and conditions of service for the domestic help. I trust that the intention of the proposed provisions is to catch out employers of large labour force rather than to capitalise on any misunderstanding\n\nbetween husband and wife in relation to the employment of their domestic help.\n\nIn clause 6 of the Bill, a new subsection (3) has been added to section 6 of the principal Act, which provides that a heavy penalty is liable to be imposed on an employer who, after making the requisite deductions from the pay packet of his employees, forgets or refuses to remit the same to the CPF Board. A vital distinction is made from the employer who fails to pay his own contribution under the principal Act within the prescribed period, as dealt with in clause 7 of the Bill, which I will comment upon later. The distinction is necessary, as the Minister has pointed out just now, as the sums of money deducted from the wages of the workers for payment to the CPF Board do not belong to the employers but are only held in trust by them. As such, the sums so deducted should not be retained by employers for any period longer than is necessary, and any provision discouraging them from doing so is undeniably in the interest of workers.\n\nIn the same clause 6 of the Bill, the proposed subsections (1) and (2) of section 6 of the principal Act are substantially a rehash of the existing provisions and are apparently intended to accommodate new circumstances which may arise from any implementation of such recommendations of the National Wages Council as the Government may have accepted. One difficulty, however, is posed by the time-lapse between the effective date of the increase of CPF rates that is, in the case of this year I per cent on 1st July, 1973 - and the actual date of payment of NWC's recommendations, even though with retrospective effect. The result is that a worker may suffer a cut in his take-home pay because of the increased CPF's rate of contribution based on his salary without the benefit of any NWC's increment. An obvious retort from the Minister would be that, even without any NWC's increment, he would have received an increase in pay by way of a higher sum credited to his CPF account and that,\n\nif he is a member of a trade union, he should press his union not to procrastinate in the hope of a greater increment than what the NWC has recommended. Sometimes, however, the delay in implementing the NWC's recommendations is not occasioned by either the trade union or the employer but by complexities or peculiarities of terms and conditions of service not considered by the NWC.\n\nBut the point I want to make is to relate clause 6 of the Bill to clause 10 of the Bill amending section 10 of the principal Act which governs the payment of interest on contributions credited with the CPF. I believe that the purpose of this amendment is to enable the CPF Board to compute interest on a more conscionable basis than the present yearly basis, which is manifestly unjust. Charge them interest every month. We welcome it. On the other hand, if the Post Office Savings Bank is able to compute interest on voluntary savings on a monthly basis. I should think the CPF Board should be able to do so similarly on compulsory savings of workers. With the additional consideration of clause 7 of the Bill, amending section 7 of the principal Act, which provides for the payment of an enhanced penalty in respect of contributions which are belated by even one day, any decision by the CPF Board to compute interest at an interval longer than one month clearly smacks of profiteering under the guise of bureaucratic inefficiency. The CPF wants to collect 1 1/2 per cent every month from the employer. Pay some to the employees as well.\n\nLastly, clause 11 of the Bill has introduced a new paragraph (c) to subsection (2) of section 11 of the principal Act by providing for the large category of Malaysian workers who are employed in Singapore and who have CPF contributions credited to their respective accounts while so employed in Singapore. The proposed provision enables the Board to permit such workers to withdraw their contributions in certain circumstances on their departure from\n\nSingapore for good. Co-ordination perhaps with the Work Permit Office and other relevant departments would serve to ascertain whether the departure of such workers from Singapore is permanent or otherwise. Difficulty may he met by the CPF Board in trying to trace the whereabouts of such workers twenty or thirty years after they have left Singapore.\n\nWith the above comments, I repeat that I am wholly in favour of the proposed amendments to the Central Provident Fund Act but would request the Government to compute interest on a more conscionable basis, and that is, on a monthly basis like the Post Office Savings Bank is doing.\n\n4.25 p.m.\n\nMr Teong Eng Siong(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill is to make the implementation of the principal Act more effective in order to benefit all the workers. This is a very good amendment.\n\nSir, the Minister in his speech mentioned that the total deposit in the CPF has now reached $1,500 million with a membership of 911,000. This is very significant. I would like to ask the Minister a few questions. Firstly, since the CPF Board has this large sum of money totalling $1,500 million, in what way will the CPF invest this money and what benefit or interest will be derived from the investment every year?\n\nSecondly, is the CPF Board prepared to raise the interest rate so that all the 911,000 members can enjoy better benefits?\n\nThirdly, as we all know, the CPF Board is now constructing a new building. I would like to ask where does the money for this building project come from. Does it come from the Government or from the Fund itself?\n\nI have a suggestion to make to the Minister. For a long time, the rules of the CPF stipulate that only members of the Fund who read 55\n\nyears of age and retiring are qualified to withdraw their contributions from the CPF. But in my constituency there are certain people who are faced with financial difficulties because they have been retrenched and have retired before reaching 55 years of age. So they have a great need for funds. Therefore, they applied to the CPF for a withdrawal of funds or at least part of their contributions to repair their houses which are dilapidated, and for other purposes.\n\nMr Speaker: Mr Teong, can you confine your debate to the principle of this Bill and not go outside its scope, please?\n\nMr Teong Eng Siong(In Mandarin): Sir, I would like to suggest to the Minister that those members who retire before reaching the age of 55 should be allowed to withdraw their CPF contributions for valid reasons.\n\n4.29 p.m.\n\nMr Ong Pang Boon: Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the Member for Telok Blangah that it is not the intention of this amendment Bill to catch the small employers, the employer of a domestic servant, for instance. The intention is really to catch the big employers of a large labour force. I am quite sure the CPF inspectors will be able to exercise a certain amount of discretion when dealing with employers of domestic servants who fail to pay CPF contributions for a genuine reason.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, the CPF Board has, in fact, considered the possibility of computing interest monthly, but there are certain technical difficulties which it cannot overcome as yet at present.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy: But the Post Office can do it.\n\nMr Ong Pang Boon: Yes, but the Post Office is probably somewhat different from the CPF. The Member may be aware that the CPF has a new computer with a larger capacity. It is hoped that when the computer is fully installed and functioning, it may he possible in the near future to compute\n\nthe interest at shorter intervals than yearly as at present.\n\nAll the monies collected by the CPF are invested in Government bonds. The CPF is not permitted to invest in other more profitable commercial securities. As the Government bond only pays an interest of about 6 per cent, the CPF therefore cannot pay an interest of more than 53/4 per cent. Much as the CPF would like to pay more, I do not think it is possible. The quarter per cent earned by CPF is used to pay for administrative expenses and staff salaries. I think this probably answers the question of the Member for Sembawang regarding the use of the CPF contributions.\n\nThe CPF building is built out of funds accumulated by the CPF over the years.\n\nAs for withdrawal before reaching 55 years of age, I do not think the present law permits that, unless the member is leaving Singapore for good or is unable to work indefinitely. So I am afraid the Member for Sembawang will have to be satisfied with the answer at the moment.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. BUS SERVICES LICENSING AUTHORITY (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n4.35 p.m.\n\nThe Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nHon. Members may recall that on 11th April, 1971, the 10 Chinese bus companies regrouped into three companies, namely, Amalgamated Bus\n\nCompany (ABC), Associated Bus Service (ABS) and the United Bus Company (UBC). The Singapore Traction Company (STC) was the fourth bus company and when it ceased operation in December, 1971, its routes were taken over by these three companies which in due course built up a fleet of over 2,000 buses deployed in 143 bus routes.\n\nWith the recent amalgamation of the three companies into a single company known as the Singapore Bus Service Ltd (SBS), which we understand was registered on 11th July, 1973, it will be necessary for the Bus Services Licensing Authority to monitor closely the progress of the new company, its affairs and its financial position.\n\nThe existing Bus Services Licensing Authority Act has provisions requiring bus companies to submit audited accounts. However, it is not mandatory for the bus companies to do so within a stipulated period of time after the close of the financial year.\n\nThe amendment Bill, therefore, proposes to make it mandatory for the bus companies to submit audited accounts, including Statements of Revenue and Expenditure, to the Bus Services Licensing Authority within three months after the close of each financial year. Every Director and Manager of the company will be held responsible for failure to submit the accounts within the stipulated period. On conviction, they will be liable to a fine of up to $10,000.\n\nThe Bill also empowers the Minister for Communications to appoint Inspectors to investigate into the affairs of the company. This power is necessary to ensure that the bus company is responsibly managed. In addition, I wish also to inform hon. Members of this House that separate action is being taken to increase the performance bond of $100,000 presently required from each of the three bus companies to $500,000.\n\nAll these measures are taken in order to safeguard the interest of the public in a bus transport system\n\noperated by a single bus company which in effect has a de facto monopoly of an essential public service.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Ang Kok Peng].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\n\nMr Speaker: I propose to take the Suspension now. I suspend the sitting and shall take the Chair again at ten minutes past Five.\n\nSitting accordingly suspended at 4.42 p.m. until 5.10 p.m.\n\nSitting resumed at 5.10 p.m. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR] TELECOMMUNICATION AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL\n\nOrder for Second Reading read.\n\nThe Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS for short) was established on 1st April last year under the TAS Act, 1972, by transformation of the former Telecommunications Department into a statutory body.\n\nIt has now been found from experience that it is necessary to amend the Act to enable disciplinary control over officers of the Authority to be delegated to committees appointed by the Authority, or to the Chairman or the General Manager. This would allow disciplinary cases to be more speedily disposed of.\n\nInstances have also arisen where disciplinary proceedings need to be taken against staff of the Authority for acts committed while they were employees of the former Telecommunications Department. Since the Public\n\nService Commission is not empowered to institute such proceedings against these officers following their transfer to the Authority, the Authority itself has to be vested with powers to do so. It is inconceivable that the Authority should be powerless to take action against its staff who may have committed serious offences just because these offences were committed while the staff were employed by the former Telecommunications Department. Particularly so as the Authority has, under the provisions of the TAS Act, 1972, taken over the assets and liabilities of the former Telecommunications Department.\n\nThis Bill also seeks to establish beyond doubt that the Authority is vested with powers to terminate the services of, dismiss and exercise disciplinary control over its staff. It also seeks to enable the Authority to make regulations for the disciplinary control of its staff.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Ang Kok Peng].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. CIVIL LIABILITY (OIL POLLUTION) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n5.15 p.m.\n\nThe Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nIn the recent oil pollution incidents the experience of the Port of Singapore Authority shows that the existing laws are inadequate to ensure that the Port and the Government are fully reimbursed for the expenditure arising from the damage caused by oil pollution. The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to\n\nenable us to impose strict liability for oil pollution damage.\n\nThe Civil Liability (Oil Pollution) Bill, 1973, is based on the principles embodied in the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage. This Convention imposes strict liability but entitles a shipowner to limit his liability for oil pollution damage in any one incident. It also provides three exceptions to liability.\n\nI shall now summarise briefly the main provisions of the Bill. Clause 3 provides that where oil is discharged or escapes from any ship or off-shore or on-shore facility, the owner or operator shall be liable for any damage caused, for the cost of any measures taken to prevent the damage, and for any damage caused by the measures so taken. However, a shipowner's liability for oil pollution damage is limited to S$375 for each ton of the ship's tonnage or S$50 million (when the tonnage results in a greater amount).\n\nThe Bill provides for three exceptions to liability. The owner or operator will not be liable if he proves that the oil escaped as a result of: -\n\n(i) an act of war or an act of God;\n\n(ii) wilful act of a third party;\n\n(iii) negligence of the Government or the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) in maintaining navigational aids.\n\nIt is only equitable that exception (iii) is included, for the PSA must be held responsible for proper maintenance of navigational aids in the Port. In cases where liability is not based on clause 3 but on common law, the Bill gives the right to recover costs of measures taken to prevent oil pollution damage.\n\nThe Director of Marine and the Port Master are empowered to detain a ship suspected of polluting the sea and to require the owner to make a cash deposit or other security before the ship is released. The Bill, however, does not apply to warships and government vessels not used for commercial purposes.\n\nThe Schedule of the Bill will amend the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act, 1971, and will raise the maximum penalty for oil pollution offences from S$20,000 to S$500,000. Mr Speaker, Sir, if this provision of the Bill would appear to be severe, it is because we regard the problem of pollution of the sea as a major problem requiring strong measures for effective control. As our Port is a fairly busy one, it is vital that adequate measures are adopted to discourage the pollution of our harbour, territorial waters and shore-lines by ships and shore establishments.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n5.20 p.m.\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin: Mr Speaker, Sir, on a matter of interest, I wonder whether the Minister of State can enlighten the House as to whether most of the major maritime nations have now adopted the agreement reached at the International Convention at Brussels on the question of limits of liability.\n\nDr Ang Kok Peng: Sir, I have not got the information with me. But if the hon. Member will give me notice of a question, I will be able to give him an answer.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Ang Kok Peng].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. DESTRUCTION OF DISEASE-BEARING INSECTS (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n5.22 p.m.\n\nThe Minister of State for the Environment (Mr Wee Toon Boon): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, the Bill before the House is based on the existing Destruction of Disease-Bearing Insects Act (Chapter 152, 1970 Edition). Consequent to the difficulties and problems encountered in the application and administration of the Act during the last two years, the need has arisen to amplify the Act to ensure better control of disease-bearing insects through more effective enforcement action.\n\nOne major problem encountered relates to difficulties in obtaining the names, addresses, proof of identity and other relevant particulars of occupiers and owners of premises. This defect has hindered the issue of orders and summonses considerably. Specific powers are now included in the Bill to facilitate officers to obtain such information of any offender or suspect and to arrest such person without warrant if he declines to supply the required particulars.\n\nA device of \"ticketing\" is to be introduced in respect of offences committed under the Act to empower officers to serve on offenders notices to attend at the Court described, at a specified date and time, so that the Court may take cognizance of the offences. The purpose of this provision is to enable more expeditious and effective enforcement of the Act.\n\nA presumption clause has now been introduced which will have the effect of fixing on the owner or occupier the responsibility for any premises conducive to the propagation of disease-bearing insects, unless the contrary is proved.\n\nThe term \"disease-bearing insect\" is now re-defined to include every specie of mosquitoes and house flies. This enables many potential insect vectors to come under control and prevention.\n\nUnder the present provision, a medical officer is required to appear in Court for the purpose of giving evidence to prove that a particular mosquito or insect is, in fact, a disease-bearing insect. In order to eliminate this time-consuming procedure, a provision is made in the Bill whereby reports signed by any Medical Officer of Health, Government\n\nEntomologist or Public Health Engineer concerning any matter or thing submitted for examination, analysis or report are admissible in Court as constituting prima facie evidence.\n\nThe other minor amendments to the Bill serve to specify and define more explicitly the existing powers of the Act.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Wee Toon Boon].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n5.26 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".\n\nSir, the main purpose of the Bill, as found in the Explanatory Statement, is to establish the \"Singapore Sports Council\" which will take over the functions of the National Sports Promotion Board and the National Stadium Corporation.\n\nThe National Sports Promotion Board came into being with the coming into force of the National Sports Promotion Board Act in February 1971, and the National Stadium Corporation with the coming into force of the National Stadium Corporation Act in November 1971. At that time, it was considered necessary that there should be a separate organisation for the National Stadium which was at the initial stages of its construction. The Stadium has now been completed and was officially opened by our Prime Minister on 21st July, 1973. At this stage, it would not be economical to have two organisations concerned with the promotion of sports and the provision of recreational and sports facilities. The National Sports Promotion Board is\n\nconcerned with the promotion of sports and the provision of facilities. The National Stadium Complex will be the main sports complex in Singapore and would also be concerned with sports. The time has now come for the two organisations to be amalgamated, so as to achieve the maximum utilisation of staff, finance and facilities.\n\nWith amalgamation, there would be a streamlined administrative machinery, which would result not only in a considerable amount of savings in finances on personal emoluments and office space, but also in more efficient performance in sports promotion. In this connection, I wish to mention that this new administrative machinery will pay particular attention to intra and inter-Constituency games which form an important mass base for the new \"sports for all\" national policy.\n\nThe enactment of the Singapore Sports Council Act is in keeping with the new \"sports for all\" policy which the Government has embarked upon. Under this policy, the aim would be towards achieving good health, physical well-being, beneficial recreation and better spending of leisure time by our population. It also aims at raising the standard of sports so that it becomes an essential part of our national life. In furtherance of this policy, the objectives of this Council would be:\n\n(a) to improve the physical fitness standards of the people of the Republic;\n\n(b) to encourage mass participation of the population in sports in the Republic;\n\n(c) to provide the people of the Republic with maximum facilities so as to enable them to carry out their sports and recreational activities; and lastly,\n\n(d) to raise the standard of sports at all levels in the Republic.\n\nThe various provisions of the Bill are geared towards achieving these objectives. The main functions, as contained in clause 8 of the Bill, are to plan and to promote, to co-ordinate and to cooperate, to encourage and arrange sports,\n\ngames and recreation and physical education in conjunction with the Ministry of Education and the Singapore National Olympic Council and national sports organisations. Some of the other functions are to foster research and physical education and establish sports stadia and other sports facilities as are deemed necessary.\n\nUnder clause 9 of the Bill, the powers given to the Council are mainly to recommend minimum standards for participation in international sports, competitions and games; to advise on the planning, promotion and standards of physical education; to raise funds; to make grants or contributions to sports organisations, and to conduct commercial and business ventures.\n\nClause 11 refers to transfer to the Council of the undertakings of the National Stadium Corporation and the National Sports Promotion Board, while clause 12 provides for the continued secondment of Government employees of either Board following the amalgamation and later absorption into the service of the Council. It also provides in clause 13 for non-Government employees to be transferred. Part VI of the Bill provides for financial matters. There is provision in the Bill for the Council to receive loans or grants from both the Government and the private sector, including the Singapore Pools (Private) Limited. One new innovation in this Bill is that most of the financial provisions are set out in schedule form attached to it, and this has the advantage of shortening the Bill considerably.\n\nThe Bill does not confer authoritative powers nor powers to impose sanctions or penalties over national sports associations or private clubs, nor does it interfere with or usurp the functions of relevant Ministries, like the Ministry of Education. The Singapore Sports Council will be there to advise, encourage, coordinate and lead.\n\nIt is expected that with the setting up of the Singapore Sports Council by the amalgamation of the National Sports Promotion Board and the National Stadium\n\nCorporation, we will have a streamlined organisation made up of persons actively concerned with the promotion of sports, who would over the years he able to work together and build up a base among the masses, a base that would give the support necessary to bring about the popularity of sports. Whereas the Singapore Sports Council will be involved in the running of sports and physical education programmes, as well as the provision of facilities, the Ministry of Social Affairs will be actively concerned with policy direction.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to emphasise that with the formation of the Singapore Sports Council, we can look forward to seeing that the main objective of promoting mass participation of the people-in sports in Singapore, as well as bringing about physical fitness of the population, so essential to security and productivity in Singapore, would be achieved in the years ahead.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\n5.34 p.m.\n\nDr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Singapore Sports Council Bill. As in 1971, when the National Sports Promotion Board Bill was introduced, there is an air of hope for sports in Singapore. It is my personal hope and wish that the air now is not the same as the air then. However, looking at the present set-up, I am confident that the present Singapore Sports Council will augur well for sports in Singapore in future. However, I would be failing at this stage if I do not bring up a few points which I think are worth noting. Some of the officials in the last few surviving days-of the National Sports Promotion Board, who were responsible for some of the acts of mischief, are still very much with this new body and unless the new officials who are in charge will bear their authority upon these junior officials, I am afraid some of the acts of mischief committed in the past might be repeated in the new Council.\n\nSecondly, I notice that there is a definite shortage of staff in this big sports body. If that is the problem, then I think if we do not enlarge the staff we might be faced with more problems. Thirdly, I would like to comment on the efficiency and leadership which was so markedly lacking in the last National Sports Promotion Board. It is our hope that with the introduction of new officials, this noticeable lack of qualities in the past will no longer be with us now and we look forward to able leadership in the Singapore Sports Council.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the Minister for Social Affairs that my colleagues and fellow Members of Parliament here who have in the past brought to light some of the unpleasant problems would join me in wishing this new Singapore Sports Council all the very best, and we give it our fullest support.\n\nEncik Othman Bin Wok: Mr Speaker, Sir, just a few words to thank the Member and his colleagues for the support which they are giving to the Bill. One of the objectives of this Bill is also to rectify all the mistakes that have been made before, and to improve on the efficiency of the new organisation.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Encik Othman Bin Wok].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\n\nSTATUTES OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) (NO. 3) BILL\n\nOrder for Second Reading read.\n\n5.40 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSince the publication of the eight volumes of the 1970 Revised Edition of Statutes, certain printing and other minor errors appearing therein have come to light, and this Bill is designed to rectify these errors.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr E. W. Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. FISHERIES (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n5.43 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, the Bill that is before the House seeks to amend the Fisheries Act (Chapter 294 of the Revised Edition) with a view to providing a more exemplary penalty for trawl-net fishing within the territorial waters of Singapore. Trawler operations of late have increased to such an extent that they are not merely a destructive nuisance but have deprived many a coastal fisherman of his livelihood. Furthermore this method of fishing, whereby a vessel tows a net shaped like an open bag, is to be particularly condemned because of the manner in which immature and unmarketable fish, prawns and other forms of marine life are destroyed, when used in our shallow coastal waters. In addition to taking away almost everything in its path, the trawl-net drags away and destroys the fishing gear of our coastal fishermen and breaks their lines and nets. These operations have resulted in numerous complaints being made to the authorities, and despite a series of raids carried out to apprehend trawlers fishing within our territorial waters, this method of fishing has not abated.\n\nHon. Members who are aware of this problem have no doubt looked up\n\nthe Fisheries Act only to find that the legislation has provided relatively light sentences for such offences. This is because coastal water trawling commenced only a few years ago with only a few trawlers operating. But their numbers have since increased sufficiently to constitute a problem. One of the main reasons for the increase of such activity is the fact that the penalties imposed by the courts were not sufficient to constitute a deterrent, so that convicted trawler men continued to repeat the offence.\n\nIn order to effectively prohibit this practice of trawl-net fishing within our coastal waters, the Government has decided to introduce the amendments now before the House. Their main purpose is to provide for the imposition of a more salutary punishment upon those found guilty. Under the existing Act any person convicted of an offence under the Act, including trawling in coastal waters, is liable to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or to both such fine and imprisonment. The court may also order the confiscation of any vessel or appliance used in the commission of the offence. However, in practice, none of those convicted has so far been jailed and no vessel or appliance has been confiscated. The Bill seeks to amend the Act so that it shall he compulsory for the courts to impose on anybody convicted of inshore trawling a mandatory term of imprisonment of not less than three months and not more than three years, without the option of a fine. It also provides that the courts may make an order for the confiscation of any vessel, net, instrument or appliance used in the commission of the offence on the written application of the Public Prosecutor.\n\nFinally, the Bill confers on police officers the same powers as fishery officers to stop, search, detain and arrest any person found committing or attempting to commit an offence under the Act. This will enable the Marine Police to assist the Primary Production\n\nDepartment more effectively in its efforts to stamp out coastal trawling.\n\nIt is our hope that with these amendments to the Fisheries Act, a wasteful and destructive method of fishing within our territorial waters will completely cease or at least be reduced to negligible proportions.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Minister for introducing this Bill. The illegal trawlers regularly come to our coastal waters to catch fish, and this affects the livelihood of our fishermen. I hope the Marine Police will detail more boats to patrol our coastal waters so as to prevent these illegal trawlers from fishing in our coastal waters.\n\nMr Barker: Sir, I am not in charge of the Marine Police. But with the amendments proposed in the Bill, which give police officers the same powers as fishery officers, there will be more police patrols.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. --[Mr Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\n\nSERVICES' LANDS BOARD (REPEAL) BILL\n\nOrder for Second Reading read.\n\n5.52 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Services' Lands Board Act and to transfer all the assets and liabilities of the Services' Lands Board to the Singapore Government.\n\nDuring the Constitutional Conference held in the United Kingdom in 1958, it was agreed, inter alia, that the United\n\nKingdom Services should retain the land which they occupied in Singapore for defence purposes and that there should be established by statute a Services' Lands Board. It was also agreed that lands paid for by or on behalf of the Services should be transferred to and vested in the Board. The Services' Lands Board Ordinance was, therefore, enacted in 1959.\n\nSince its incorporation, the Services' Lands Board has been granted leases of State Lands.\n\nIn the recent Exchange of Notes on Defence Arrangements between the Governments of Singapore and the United Kingdom, it was agreed, inter alia, that all lands in Singapore held by the Board should, with effect from 1st November, 1971, be transferred to and be vested in the Government of Singapore.\n\nThe Bill seeks to give effect to this agreement and to abolish the Board.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.ADJOURNMENT: Resolved,\n\n\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"-[Mr Barker].\n\nAdjourned accordingly at Five minutes to Six o'clock p.m.", "url": "https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/#/report?sittingdate=25-07-1973"}
