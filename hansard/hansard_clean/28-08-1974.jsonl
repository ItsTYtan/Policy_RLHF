I shall be referring to this Paper when we come to Question No. 6 for Oral Answer on the Order Paper for today.\n\nMr Speaker: Yes.\n\nORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND CONTRIBUTIONS (Purchase of flats built by Housing and Urban Development Co. (Pte.) Ltd.)\n\n1. Mr Ang Nam Piau asked the Minister for Labour if he will consider extending the provisions of the Central Provident Fund (Approved Housing Schemes) Regulations, 1968, to purchases of flats to be built by the Housing and Urban Development Company (Private) Limited, so that persons in the middle-income group may make use of the amounts standing to their credit in, and their contributions to, the Central Provident Fund for the purchase of such flats.\n\nThe Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour): Mr Speaker, Sir, Members will\n\nrecall that the Central Povident Fund (Approved Housing Schemes) Regulations, 1968, were primarily designed to encourage home ownership among the lower income group. Notwithstanding that, I told the House last March that this policy would be reviewed in 1976 with a view to extending the provisions of the regulations to the middle income group. My Ministry understands and appreciates the problems and difficulties faced by the middle income group in purchasing a flat or a house and we are in full sympathy with them. We have therefore decided to review the policy this year instead of in 1976.\n\nMembers of the House will be glad to know that my Ministry has decided in principle to allow the middle income group to use part of their CPF savings for the purchase of flats to be built by the Housing and Urban Development Co. (Pte.) Ltd. The details of the middle income housing project are being worked out by the Housing and Urban Development Co. (Pte.) Ltd. Once these are finalised, the rules and regulations governing the use of CPF savings by the middle income group for the purchase of these flats will be worked out and announced. This scheme will be available only for housing units built with Government funds, for example, those built by the Housing and Development Board and the Housing and Urban Development Co. (Pte.) Ltd.\n\nSINGAPORE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (Additional facilities and construction of second runway)\n\n2. Mr P. Govindaswamy asked the Minister for Communications, in regard to the Paya Lebar International Airport, (a) if it is proposed to erect a step-like platform in the Waving Gallery to enable more people to watch aircraft landing and taking off; (b) if he will consider the provision of bigger lockers for the use of transit passengers and a restaurant or refreshment room on the ground floor of the terminal building; and (c) with the heavy aircraft traffic, what is the progress in the construction of the second runway and when it will be completed.\n\nThe Minister of State for Communications (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister for Conununications): Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to inform the hon. Member for Anson that the waving gallery at Paya Lebar International Airport was closed with effect from 19th March, 1974, for conversion into offices, in view of the shortage of such space at Singapore Airport. An announcement to this effect was made in the press.\n\nAs for the provision of bigger lockers for transit passengers, I would like to inform the Member that the present luggage locker service which commenced business in February this year has 51 standard-sized lockers to accommodate normal-sized baggage. Larger-sized baggage, which cannot go into any of the standard-sized lockers, are being accepted at the operator's counter for storage behind the counter where some open storage space is available. The Department of Civil Aviation has requested the operator to provide bigger lockers and the operator is presently looking into this request.\n\nAs for the provision of a restaurant or refreshment room on the ground floor of the Passenger Terminal Building, with the current heavy passenger traffic which is increasing, it is not considered desirable to re-assign space on the ground floor for restaurant or refresh-\n\nment area, as such facilities would occupy a very large area.\n\nThe present airport restaurant at the Passenger Terminal Building occupies almost the entire first floor above the public Main Concourse. Easy access from the ground floor has been provided to enable passengers as well as their well-wishers to patronize the restaurant. Furthermore, in the departure/transit hail, restaurant facilities have also been provided for transit passengers to have their meals and refreshments, if needed.\n\nAlthough approval for the construction of the second runway was given by the Development Planning Committee in July, 1973, no actual construction work has begun. The subject is still under review consequent to the steep rise in oil fuel early this year, and we are watching the impact on the rate of traffic growth. However, land acquisition and resettlement are proceeding for the second runway. If traffic warrants it, the second runway could be ready by the early 1980s.\n\nPOSTAL SERVICE (Transfer of Division I Officers)\n\n3. Mr P. Govindaswamy asked the Minister for Communications how many Division I Officers in the Postal Service have been transferred to other departments of the Public Service since March, 1973, or how soon such transfers will take place.\n\nMr Chai Chong Yii (for the Minister for Communications): Mr Speaker, Sir, since March, 1973, three Division I Officers in the Postal Services Departn:ent have been transferred out as follows:\n\n1. An Assistant Controller of Posts, with 2 years 6 months' service in the Department, was absorbed into the Statistics Service and attached to the Ministry of Labour as from 16th August, 1973.\n\n2. An Assistant Controller of Posts, with a degree in Engineering, took up the appointment of Mechanical Engineer in the Public Works Department with\n\neffect from 1st November, 1973. He had 1 year 5 months' service with the Postal Services Department.\n\n3. An Assistant Controller of Posts, with 2 years 8 months' service in the Department, was absorbed into the Administrative Service with effect from 1st January, 1974, but remains in the Postal Services Department on secondment basis for a period of one year with effect from 1st January, 1974, or until the vacancy is filled, whichever is earlier.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy (Anson): Mr Speaker, Sir, why was the Mechanical Engineer recruited into the Postal Services Department in the first instance?\n\nMr Chai Chong Yii: Sir, the Postal Services Department is a closed service, and if someone with a degree in Engineering applies for a post in the Postal Service and is accepted, I see no reason why we should not allow him to work there. But after working for some time, he shows more interest in some other department and, in fact, that was the reason why he was transferred out.\n\nPOSTAL SERVICES (Motorised delivery of mail in rural areas)\n\n4. Mr P. Govindaswamy asked the Minister for Communications (a~ how many scooters and motor cycles (including reserves) are available in the Postal Services Department for the delivery of mail in the rural areas; and (h) how successful has the use of these motorised units been in expediting the delivery of mail in the rural areas.\n\nMr Chai Chong Yii (for the Minister for Communications): Mr Speaker, Sir, 88 out of a total fleet of 124 motor scooters are available for delivery duties in the rural areas.\n\nIt is the view of the Postal Services Department that the use of scooters in the rural areas has been successful. In these areas, the delivery beats cover relatively longer distances of travel between the delivery post office and the\n\nfirst delivery point. The delivery points are also more scattered. Use of scooterised beats in the rural areas has reduced the travelling time of postmen by about 60 per cent, and each scooterised delivery beat can handle up to 33 per cent more mail traffic than a bicycle beat.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy: Mr Speaker, Sir, are all the motor scooters serviceable?\n\nMr Chai Chong Yii: Sir, the answer is yes.\n\nMr P. Govindaswamy: Sir, are there sufficient spare parts for the motor scooters?\n\nMr Chai Chong Yii: Sir, the Postal Services Department has four spare motor scooters and nine spare motor cycles. These are not included in the total fleet of 124 motor scooters which I have just given.\n\nLAMINATED DRIVING LICENCES (Issue of, and insertion of date of original issue)\n\n5. Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Communications if he will consider the issue of laminated driving licences and the insertion of the date of original issue in such licences so as to indicate the driving experience of holders.\n\nMr Chai Chong Yii (for the Minister for Communications): Mr Speaker, Sir. it is the intention of the Registrar of Vehicles to issue laminated driving licences with the inclusion of the date of original issue of a driving licence to indicate the driving experience of the holder of such a licence. As priority is given to public bus transport, the vocational and driving licences of bus drivers and conductors are being replaced first. The exercise to replace existing licences started on 15th July, 1974, and as on 19th August, 1974, 2,935 or 63 per cent of bus drivers and 2,648 or 65 per cent of conductors have been issued with laminated licences.\n\nIn the second phase, the vocational licences of taxi-drivers and general driving licences will be replaced. As there\n\nare 14,397 taxi-drivers and 533,631 general driving licences as at 31st March, 1974, officers in the Registry of Vehicles and Computer Services Department of the Ministry of Finance will be making a joint study on the implementation of this phase.\n\nMASS TRANSIT STUDY (Progress made)\n\n6. Mr Ong Teng Cheong asked the Minister for Communications what progress has been made in the Mass Transit Study, and whether there is any recommendation made or decision reached on the subject so far.\n\nThe Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin): Mr Speaker, Sir, the long awaited Final Report on Phase I Mass Transit Study has at last been completed and, with your permission, I have earlier on tabled it in this House as a Misc. Paper No. 3 of 1974. This is the Report in Brief, as the actual Final Report is somewhat voluminous with 232 pages and quite technical in character.\n\nThe Consultants, Wilbur Smith and Associates, in association with Parsons Brinkerhoff - Tudor-Bechtel who prepared the report for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in short, the World Bank, as Executing Agency of the United Nations Development Programme and the Government of the Republic of Singapore indicated several reasons which make it vital that any transport policy needed to support the development envisaged for Singapore must provide for a Mass Transit System.\n\nThe study examined six alternative systems, viz. (a) an extension of the existing road-based all-bus system on shared rights-of-way; (b) three rail-based systems; and (c) two all-bus mass rapid transit systems incorporating grade-separated busways. Each of these systems was evaluated in terms of operational feasibility, economic costs and benefits and impacts on the community. From the evaluation, the Consultants have recommended a rail-based mass\n\nrapid transit 3R system for further detailed study.\n\nBriefly, the recommended system has a total length of 24 miles, of which 10 miles would be underground and the balance at surface or at elevated levels. A total of 31 stations are planned, of which 16 would be underground.\n\nThe rail system envisages a network of connections from Jurong in the west through the Central Area to Siglap in the east, with a branch line from the Central area through the Orchard Road corridor, thence to Toa Payoh and ending at Ang Moh Kio to the north.\n\nThe estimated cost of the recommended 3R MRT system (according to 1972 prices) is $698 million which, however, does not include the cost of rolling stock or financing costs.\n\nGovernment has since decided to proceed with further Phase II detailed study of the recommended MRT system in respect of the engineering, economic and financial feasibility and which is expected to be completed, within a period of six months. The objectives for the Phase II study are as follows:\n\n(a) Soils tests along the proposed railway route, with special reference to those sections for which underground construction is recommended;\n\n(b) Updated estimates of construction costs, to an accuracy of approximately 20 per cent;\n\n(c) Analyses and comparisons of fare structures, ridership and revenues for the railway and scheduled bus services;\n\n(d) Updating of costs and benefits for the years 1982 and 1992, and calculations of financial and economic rates of return for alternative investment sequences of the MRT system, having regard to:\n\n(i) the impact of planned highway investment, and\n\n(ii) the proposed short-term measures to promote the efficient use of existing transport facilities.\n\nYOUTH ACTIVITIES (Setting up of co-ordinating body)\n\n7. Mr J. F. Conceicao asked the Minister for Culture whether any decision has been taken with regard to the setting up of a co-ordinating body for youth activities.\n\nThe Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong): Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been decided that a National Youth Co-ordinating Committee be established to co-ordinate youth activities in Singapore. The Committee will comprise representatives from the Ministries of Social Affairs, Education, Culture, Labour and the People's Association. The People's Association will chair the National Youth Co-ordinating Committee.\n\nCOMMUNITY CHEST (Setting up of)\n\n8. Mr Hwang Soo Jin asked the Minister for Social Affairs whether it has been decided to set up a \"Community Chest\" for charitable organisations.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been some publicity in recent months on the establishment of a Community Chest in our Republic. I am sure that the Member for Jalan Kayu is aware that the Singapore Council of Social Service is actively working on the establishment of a Community Chest with the aim of centralising fund-raising efforts to finance voluntary welfare activities in the Republic.\n\nMy Ministry supports the concept of a Community Chest. The establishment of such a Community Chest will result in an efficient utilisation of public donations for those in need and, moreover, by preventing the duplication and profusion of fund-raising efforts by the various voluntary welfare organisations, the Community Chest would enable these voluntary welfare organisations to\n\nconcentrate mainly on welfare work per se and to increase its efficiency and scope to meet the welfare needs of the community.\n\nCARE FOR THE AGED AND AGED SICK (Adequacy and co-ordination of services)\n\n9. Mr Hwang Soo Jin asked the Minister for Social Affairs (a) what was the total number of (i) aged persons, and (ii) aged sick persons maintained by the various charitable homes for each of the five years from 1969 to 1973; (b) whether he has any plan to organise more adequate services for these categories of people; and (c) if he will encourage and assist in the setting up of a National Association for the aged and the aged sick so as to coordinate efforts in this direction.\n\nMr Chan Chee Seng (for the Minister for Social Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, according to available records maintained by the Social Welfare Department, the total number of aged persons in the various charitable homes was as follows:-\n Year Number\n\n1969 471\n\n1970 467\n\n1971 538\n\n1972 608\n\n1973 669\n\nThe total number of residents in the Woodlands Home for the Aged administered by the Social Welfare Department was:-\n Year Number\n\n1969 375\n\n1970 433\n\n1971 437\n\n1972 463\n\n1973 564\n\nThere is no accurate record of the number of aged sick persons in the various charitable homes known to the Social Welfare Department. According to\n\nrecords maintained by these homes, the number of aged sick persons was as follows: -\n Year Number\n\n1969 295\n\n1970 316\n\n1971 438\n\n1972 436\n\n1973 451\n\nThe only Government Chronic Sick Hospital has about 100 aged sick persons under its care.\n\nThe Member for Jalan Kayu will agree that caring for the aged and aged sick, as in all welfare efforts, must be a community responsibility involving both the efforts of the Government and the private sector. There is happily no lack of initiative from both these sectors in the planning and implementation of more adequate services for the aged and the aged sick. Although both the Government and voluntary welfare organisations do provide institutional care for the aged and the aged sick, this we recognise is, at best, only a poor substitute for family care. Recent developments in the Republic have been in the direction of establishing facilities and services which will encourage the aged as well as the able-bodied persons to continue living and participating in the community. In the planning of more adequate services for these categories of people therefore, both the Government and voluntary welfare organisations have borne in mind the need for a balanced approach and have taken steps both to improve facilities and increase accommodation in institutions for the aged as well as to introduce new services which will enable the continued participation of the aged in the community.\n\nAs far as Government effort is concerned, in addition to the construction of four new dormitories in the Woodlands Home for the Aged to accommodate a greater number of aged persons, the Department of Social Welfare is proposing the setting up of Area Social Welfare Centres in the various housing estates which will provide, among other services, the establishment of Old\n\nPeople's Clubs where the aged could have the opportunity of socialising with others, engaging in leisure activities and on the whole leading a more meaningful life.\n\nIn keeping with the new thinking not to isolate the aged from the community, the Government recognises the need to assist the aged to continue living with their families. The revised Income Tax laws which allow for tax relief for maintenance of aged parents and grandparents is one of the positive measures by the Government in this direction.\n\nIn the voluntary sector, the Singapore Council of Social Service is setting up a Home for the Aged at Mandai. A community Home for the Aged in a housing estate at Henderson Hill has been implemented successfully, and this has encouraged other efforts by the Singapore Council of Social Service to explore the possibility of establishing a paying hostel for old people at Housing and Development Board estates.\n\nIt is envisaged that with the longer life expectation which people now enjoy, the problem of the care of the aged will become more acute. There will, therefore, be necessity for the activities of the various organisations concerned with the care of the aged to be co-ordinated. It may not, however, be necessary to set up a National Association for the aged sick but to have such co-ordination done through existing facilities now available. It may be possible for the Council of Social Service whose objects are \"to co-ordinate voluntary welfare activities in Singapore not only as between member organisations of the Council but also with other organisations\" to undertake this function.\n\nMr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu): Sir, would the Parliamentary Secretary please inform the House whether there is any intention to lay down minimum standards in the running of these homes, with particular regard to the health and medical care, and also to control the activities of some of these homes which are being run along commercial lines?\n\nMr Chan Chee Seng: Mr Speaker, Sir, these are good suggestions, and we will give consideration to them. DEVELOPMENT OF KAMPONG SAN TENG: 10. Mr Ang Nam Piau asked the Minister for Law and National Development what is the overall development plan in the Kampong San Teng area and when the development will take place.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the long term, the Kampong San Teng area may be developed for housing and industrial estates, but at the moment there is no planned development programme.\n\nTANJONG RHU HOUSING ESTATE (Provision of car park, lifts and rubbish chutes)\n\n11. Mr J. F. Conceicao asked the Minister for Law and National Development if he will ask the Housing and Development Board to give consideration to (i) converting the planted area along Kampong Kayu Road and next to the Geylang River into a car park; and (ii) constructing additional lifts and rubbish chutes for Blocks 10 to 13 in the Tanjong Rhu Housing Estate.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Sir, the Housing and Development Board does not consider it advisable to convert the site between Kampong Kayu Road and Geylang River into a car park, because there are sufficient car parks at Kallang Park within walking distance of the housing estate.\n\nThe flats, Sir, referred to in the Question, are the emergency-type flats. It is difficult to install additional rubbish chutes for these flats without major reconstruction. However, the Board will study the feasibility of installing additional lifts in the flats, provided the costs are not prohibitive.\n\nHOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD (Reasons for increased service/conservancy charges)\n\n12. Mr Ong Teng Cheong asked the Minister for Law and National Development if he will give reasons to justify the quantum of the recent increases in service/conservancy charges in the Housing and Development Board housing estates.\n\n13. Mr P. Selvadurai asked the Minister for Law and National Development for the details of the financial and other factors that have necessitated the recent increases in the Housing and Development Board conservancy charges.\n\nThe Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to answer Questions 12 and 13 together in order to avoid repetition.\n\nMr Speaker: Yes.\n\nMr Barker: Thank you, Sir,I refer Members to the budget of the Housing and Development Board for 1974/75, which was published in the Government Gazette on 24th May, 1974. The Board will spend $40 million on management, maintenance and repairs in its estates for the current fiscal year. It hopes to recover $18 million from its collection of service and conservancy charges at the old rates. The increases in service and conservancy charges will bring in another $15 million, making a total of $33 million. So the Board has still to provide a subsidy of $7 million for the maintenance and management services to its estates. The financial statements which I referred to do not include the capital costs of constructing swimming pools, sports complexes and recreational and other amenities in the housing estates, nor the increase in loan servicing expected for all new Government loans as a result of the new Central Provident Fund rates.\n\nMembers will recall that when I announced in Parliament on 30th November last year the increases in the\n\nselling prices of Housing Board flats, I also informed Members that the service and conservancy charges for HDB flats will be increased in 1974 and that rentals may be increased. Rentals have not been increased but the service and conservancy charges have been revised with effect from 1st July, 1974.\n\nThe reasons for the revision have been explained in the press statement issued at the time. The service and conservancy charges have never gone up since 1960 when flats were first built for rental by the Housing and Development Board nor for flats sold under the Home Ownership Scheme, first introduced in 1965. Most of the tenants in flats built by the former Singapore Improvement Trust do not pay any service and conservancy charges. This is an anomaly.\n\nIn the last 10 years, there have been mounting increases in the service and conservancy costs. The charges for water used in cleaning the common areas have increased by about 248 per cent. Charges for electricity for lighting of public areas, the running of lifts and power to pump water to the roof tank has increased by about 69 to 70 per cent. Wages of workers and salaries of management staff have also increased with the National Wages Council recommendations and higher Central Provident Fund contributions, while the inflation in our construction industry has raised the costs of redecoration and maintenance works by more than 100 per cent. Lift contractors charged from $30 to $50 per month to maintain a lift in 1964. Now they charge $80 per month.\n\nResidents in Housing Board estates now enjoy better environment, services and amenities than they did 10 years ago. More greenery, gardens and playgrounds have been added in the estates. Sports complexes and swimming pools are provided in each new town. There is emergency repair service round the clock for repairs to electrical and sanitary fittings in their flats. They can call upon the service of the Lift Rescue Unit. Residents will enjoy even better environment, services and amenities\n\nin the future. Swimming pools and other sports facilities are being extended to old housing estates. The first such swimming pool is under construction for the Old Kallang Airport and Tan jong Rhu Estates. Other swimming pools are being planned for the Bukit Ho Swee and Alexandra Estates while a sports complex will serve residents in the Tiong Bahru, Redhill and Henderson Road Estates.\n\nThe increase in service and conservancy charges has been modest. They appear large only because they had not been gradually adjusted since 1960. For the 66,744 owners of Housing Board flats, the maximum increase (for the larger-sized flats) is only $10 per month. Fifty-five per cent of these owners are using their CPF credits to pay for their flats. The only cash outlay per month for their homes is the service and conservancy charges and property tax, which together come to less than the rental they would otherwise have to pay.\n\nThe Housing and Development Board subsidises the rents of tenants. It cannot subsidise increases in service and conservancy charges. The 90,450 tenants of Housing Board fiats, who previously enjoyed lower service and conservancy charges than owners, have to pay the same rate as owners of Housing Board flats. But to minimise hardship, the increase ranging from $6 for 1-room (emergency) flats to $18.50 for 4-room flats, is being implemented in two stages.\n\nTo equalise subsidies between old and new flats, service and conservancy charges for sold SIT flats are now the same as for owners of HDB flats. 14,990 tenants of SIT flats will now pay service and conservancy charges similar to HDB tenants. These SIT tenants have been enjoying free service and conservancy for the last 17 years. This was due to an administrative oversight. Nevertheless, to relieve hardship, the Housing Board has implemented the increase of these charges also in two stages.\n\nThe Housing and Development Board has to revise the service and conservancy charges to be more equal in its treatment of old and new tenants, and between owner-owned and rented, premises. Lastly, may I remind Members that the Board must also be ready to meet increased subsidies as interest rates for loans from CPF funds go up for the new estates.\n\nMr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh): Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister why has it been necessary for the Housing Board to show discrimination in the issue of these notices to tenants and owner-occupiers of HDB flats? Owner.occupiers received their notices by registered mail whereas the tenants had their notices pasted on their doors without any prior notice at all.\n\nMr Barker: Mr Speaker, Sir, there was no intended discrimination between owners and tenants even in respect of the service of these notices. Under the law it is necessary to serve a tenant or a lessee-owner with a notice which is headed, \"Notice to Quit\", before the service and conservancy charges can be raised; the intention is to terminate the tenancy so that a new tenancy can be offered and signed between the Board and the tenant. In the same way, notices had to be served on owners of flats, telling them that the old rates do not apply and that new rates will apply as from the 1st of July. Under the terms of the tenancy agreement, of which I have a blank copy here, clause 18 reads:\n\n`all notices, including notices to quit, which the Board may require to be given to the tenant shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be sufficiently served if they are posted upon some conspicuous part of the premises or if they are addressed to the tenant at the premises and forwarded by AR registered post.' To have served nearly 196,000 occupiers of HDB flats with letters by AR registered post would have cost a lot of money. Even the post office charges have gone up! So where a tenant was not at home the notice was posted on\n\nto the premises. As far as the owners or lessees were concerned, there was no such similar provision in any of the clauses of the lease. Letters, therefore, had to be sent.\n\nMr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah): Mr Speaker, Sir, at this time of economic strain and stress, what justification is there for the Housing Board to provide such luxuries like swimming pools and a sports complex? Will there be any economic return because we do not know what is in Store for us in the future?\n\nMr Barker: Mr Speaker, Sir, financially, of course, it is a strain on the resources of the Housing Board to provide recreational or sports facilities, but the dividends do not come by way of money. They come by way of better and healthier citizens. Besides, nowadays tenants and occupiers of Housing Board flats expect swimming pools and parks. When the Housing Board first built flats in 1960, all it did was to provide homes with very little recreational or sports facilities. But our standards have gone up and their demands have gone up, and we will provide these sports and recreational facilities even if we lose money on them. I think the dividends that come by way of higher standards of sports, or healthier citizens (social dividends if you like) are really worth the money spent.\n\nTOURIST AGENCIES (Complaints against and plans to control)\n\n14. Mr Yeo Choo Kok asked the Minister for Finance (a) how many travel or tour agencies have been registered with his Ministry to date; (b) how many of them are ticket agents of the Singapore Airlines; (c) how many of them are conducting overseas group tours; (d) whether and how many complaints of breach of contract against travel agencies have been lodged with the Authorities by persons who had participated in group tours; and (e) whether his Ministry plans to tighten\n\ncontrol over group tour orientated travel agencies in order to save the public from being taken for a ride by fly-by-night travel agencies.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board has since December 1970 introduced the Tourist Promotion (Licensing and Control of Tourist Agencies) Regulations to license and control tour agencies. So far, 150 tour agencies conducting local tours have been licensed. Among these, 38 are agents of the Singapore Airlines and 54 of them also conduct overseas group tours.\n\nThere have been seven cases of complaints of breach of contract lodged with the Board against licensed tourist agencies. All these cases have been amicably settled between the parties concerned. Where complainants appear to have reason to feel cheated., the agencies have, on the advice of the Board, paid compensation. Where services rendered have been poor, the agencies have been warned to maintain a reasonable standard or have their licences revoked. The Board has, therefore, been able to influence and, if necessary, exercise effective control over licensed tourist agencies.\n\nTo protect members of the public from being taken for a ride, as the Member for Delta puts it, by fly-by-night travel agencies, I have asked the Board to introduce regulations to require any person or company engaged in the business of a tour agency to take out a licence, even where it handles only outward travel. The amendments to the regulations to empower the Board to license local tourist agencies handling outward travel are being drawn up.\n\nUntil the new regulations are brought into force, it is suggested that Singapore residents book their passages for their travel abroad through the 54 licensed Singapore tour agencies conducting overseas tours. The names of these licensed agencies can be obtained from the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board.\n\nINDUSTRIAL TRAINING BOARD (Graduations, and resignation of professional staff)\n\n5. Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Education, since the establishment of the Industrial Training Board in April 1973, (a) how many students have graduated from institutions of the Board, and whether they have been able to find suitable employment in industrial establishments; and (b) how many of the Board's training officers, instructors, etc., have resigned and the reasons for their resignations, and what steps his Ministry is taking to prevent further loss of these specialists.\n\nThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar) (for the Minister for Education): Mr Speaker, Sir, since the establishment of the Industrial Training Board in April, 1973, the total number of students who have graduated from ITB institutions is 4,173. Apart from those who are called up for national service, most of the graduates have been able to find suitable employment in industrial establishments through the placement service provided by the ITB in supplying names of graduates of various institutions to relevant industries for the purpose of offering employment. The only source where information on employment of graduates from ITB institutions can be obtained is through the response from the industrial sector in notifying the ITB when appointments are accepted by the graduates. However, information provided by this source does not reflect the correct position as industries concerned do not all notify the ITB when offers of appointment are made.\n\nThere were 823 professional staff on the establishment of the Industrial Training Board in April 1973. Since then, 41 officers have resigned. They comprise 30 Education Officers and training officers, seven workshop instructors and four workshop assistants. This constitutes 4.9 per cent of the professional staff. Most of the officers did\n\nnot assign any reason for their resignation. It can, however, be surmised that they left because of better prospects in the private sector. Turnover of staff is to be expected in any organisation. The rate of resignation in the Industrial Training Board is not considered high. However, to keep the resignation rate as low as possible, various measures are being taken to make the service more attractive. These measures include a revised salary structure, accelerated increments for deserving officers and the conducting of more frequent promotion exercises.\n\nINSTITUTE OF EDUCATION (Training of University graduates)\n\n16. Mr Teong Eng Siong asked the Minister for Education (a) how many University graduates have completed their training at the Institute of Education; (b) how many of them were from (i) the University of Singapore; and (ii) the Nanyang University; and (c) how many of them have been employed in secondary schools.\n\nMr Ahmad Mattar (for the Minister for Education): Mr Speaker, Sir, since\n\nthe inception of the Institute of Education on 1st April, 1973, 217 university graduates have completed their training at the Institute of Education. Of this number, 58 of them were from the University of Singapore and 90 of them were from Nanyang University. Of the 217 who have graduated, 163 have been employed in secondary schools.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE (Particulars of admissions and employment of non-citizen graduates in public and private sectors)\n\n17. Mr J. F. Conceicao asked the Minister for Education if he will ascertain (a) how many (i) citizens, and (ii) non-citizens have been admitted to the University of Singapore for each year of the latest convenient three-year period; and (b) for the same period how many non-citizens who have graduated have accepted employment locally in (i) Government, and (ii) the private sector.\n\nMr Ahmad Mattar (for the Minister for Education): Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of citizens and non-citizens admitted to the University of Singapore for the last three intakes is as follows:\n Non-Citizens\n\nCitizens Per- Admittted(including Per-\n\nAdmitted centage permanent residents) centage Total\n\n1972-73 1,136 74.0 400 26.0 1,536\n\n1973-74 1,396 82.5 296 17.5 1,692\n\n1974-75 1,421 88.9 178 11.1 1,599\n\nThe only source where statistics on hte employment of non-citizen graduates can be obtained is the general survey on graduate employment conducted by the Economic Research Centre in August 1973. The survey covered the 1972 and 1973 batch of graduates and yielded the following results:\n Number of non-citizen graduates employed in\n\nGovernment and\n\nStatutory Boards Private Sector\n\n1972 10 17\n\n1973 10 13\n\nHowever, it is to be noted that these figures do not reflect the ture picture as only 70.3 per cent of the 1972 graduates and 57.1 per cent of the 1973 graduates responded to the survey, and it was conducted only three months after the 1973 graduation when many graduates were still seeking employment. BILLS INTRODUCED: 3.24 p.m. ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT) BILL\n\n\"to amend the Road Traffic Act (Chapter 92 of the Revised Edition)\",\n\npresented by the Minister of State for Communications (Mr Chai Chong Yii); read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. NAVAL AND AIR BASES (REPEAL) BILL: \"to repeal the Naval and Air Bases Ordinance (Chapter 83 of the 1955 Edition)\",\n\npresented by the Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker); read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. CANCELLATION OF PLANNING PERMISSION BILL: \"to cancel planning permissions granted by the planning authority under section 9 of the Planning Act (Chapter 279 of the Revised Edition) and under section 61 of the Singapore Improvement Ordinance (Chapter 259 of the 1955 Edition) and for matters connected therewith, and to repeal sections 10 and 11 of the Planning Act (Chapter 279 of the Revised Edition)\",\n\npresented by Mr E. W. Barker; read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. FORESHORES (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270 of the Revised Edition)\",\n\npresented by Mr E. W. Barker; read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL: 3.28 p.m. First Reading\n\nThe Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled \"An Act to amend the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Chapter 112 of the Revised Edition)\".\n\nBill read the First time.\n\nSecond Reading\n\nMr Speaker: Second Reading, what day?\n\nMr Lim Kim San: Now, Sir.\n\nCertificate of Urgency signed by the President in respect of the Bill, laid upon the Table by the Minister.\n\nTyped copies of the Bill distributed to Members.\n\nMr Lim Kim San: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, formerly known as the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, was brought into force on 21st October, 1955, and has been extended from time to time. The Act will lapse on 20th October, 1974, unless further extended.\n\nThis Act provides primarily for the maintenance of public safety, peace and good order, prevention of strikes and lock-outs in essential services, and detention and supervision of persons associated with activities of a criminal nature. Since its introduction, this Act has been very effective in the maintenance of public peace and order in curbing the activities of persons associated with secret societies.\n\nAn indication of the effective use of the provisions for detention under the Act is established by the fact that for the past 10 years the average number of persons arrested per year under section 43 was 1,090. As on 31st July, 1974, the total number of persons detained under section 30 was 1,074 and the number of persons ordered to be placed under Police supervision was 832. These are known criminals who would otherwise be free without the powers provided by this Act.\n\nThe current situation with regard to secret societies in the Republic is under control. For the past 10 years there has been an average of about six secret society incidents per month. However, without exercising the provisions in the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act it would not be possible to maintain\n\nthis control. There is, therefore, a need to extend the operation of the Act. It is essential that the suppression of secret societies in the Republic should go on relentlessly and also in view of their possible involvement in racial disturbances.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Kim San].\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. ESTATE DUTY (AMENDMENT) BILL: \"to amend the Estate Duty Act (Chapter 137 of the Revised Edition)\",\n\nrecommendation of President signified; presented by the Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen); read the First time, to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed.

Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\n\nThat leave be given to introduce a Bill to incorporate the Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Singapore.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat leave be given to introduce a Bill to incorporate the Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Singapore.\n\nMr Speaker: Who is prepared to introduce the Bill?\n\nMr Selvadurai: I am, Sir,I beg to introduce a Bill intituled \"An Act to incorporate the Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Singapore.\"\n\nBill read the First time.\n\nMr Speaker: Second Reading, what day?\n\nMr Selvadurai: On the next available sitting of Parliament, Sir. ELECTRICAL WORKERS AND CONTRACTORS LICENSING BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.35 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, the Public Utilities Board has for a long time recognised the need for comprehensive legislation to license, control and regulate electrical workers of all grades engaged in electrical works. The need for such a legislation has become even more pressing with the rapid development of Singapore into an industrial, commercial and communications centre. Such development entails the installation and operation of complex electrical equipment operating at increasingly higher power and voltage levels, with inherent problems of safety and requiring competent workmanship and supervision. This need has been further reinforced by the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Robinson's Fire. Whilst some form of legislation could be achieved by means of Regulations under the Public Utilities Act, legal opinion is that the licensing system contemplated would require an Act of Parliament rather than a subsidiary legislation.\n\nThe Professional Engineers Act, 1970, prohibits anyone other than professional engineers with prescribed qualifications from engaging in electrical work. It also regulates the ethical conduct of such professional engineers. It is thus, apparently, limited to professional engineers and to those exempted under the Act.\n\nAs the Professional Engineers Act stands, it will not be possible, unless specifically exempted, for electrical contractors, artisans, craftsmen and technicians to undertake electrical work. These grades of workers exist and are necessary in the engineering field. Such electrical workers should be licensed, controlled and regulated. The Electrical Workers and Contractors Licensing Bill now before this House has, therefore, been specially drawn up to cover these categories. Professional engineers engaged in electrical power engineering work have also been included in this Bill. The Public Utilities Board at present registers electrical contractors to provide an ancillary engineering service. There is, however, no registration of electrical workers. Even the registration of electrical contractors lacks legal powers to regulate their duties and res-\n\nponsibilities. The Board can only deregister them. The Bill now makes a clear distinction between an electrical worker involved in the personal performance of electrical work, and an electrical contractor who, in the course of or in connection with any trade or business, carries on electrical work. The classification of electrical workers according to qualifications, duties and degree of responsibility and the licences to be issued will be spelt out in the Regulations to be made under the Act.\n\nThe particular licence would specify the scope of the electrical work to be carried out and any restrictions in regard to the type of work or class of electrical installations, or the circumstances or manner in which the holder of the licence may perform electrical work. Provisions have been made in the Bill to ensure that it is not too restrictive in its operation, especially in regard to contractors on the Board's temporary register. I will also move an amendment to the Bill in Committee which will ensure that bona fide users of electricity may be able to perform simple electrical operations such as changing an electric lamp bulb and replacing any fuse in premises used for dwelling purposes.\n\nThe overall aim of the Bill, therefore, is to achieve licensing and control of electrical contractors and electrical workers with a view to ensuring that they will render good service to those who employ them. Penalties in the form of fines and/or imprisonment or both have been provided under the Bill, and convey the assurance that by reason of their qualifications they will perform electrical work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\nMr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Bill now being read a Second time. But I would like to urge the Minister for the Environment to give due consideration to avoid causing any serious or undue hardship to those contractors who are without qualifications but who have been engaged in contracting operations\n\nin electrical work in the past years. I wonder if the Minister would also inform the House the basis on which the licences of electrical workers and electrical contractors will be issued.\n\nMr Lim Kim San: As I have mentioned just now, we already have a register of contractors and electrical workers. The basis on which they are registered depends upon their qualifications. Among them are professional engineers, holders of diplomas from the Singapore Polytechnic, technicians who have completed a prescribed course in the vocational institutes and contractors who, from long association with their work, are considered to be competent to deal with electrical work. We have on the register 961 contractors and 732 competent persons working with the electrical contractors. It is apparent, therefore, that most, if not all, of those contractors who are carrying out electrical work are registered. This Bill is unlikely, therefore, to cause hardship.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole house.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Kim San].\n\nBill considered in Committee. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\n3.45 p.m.\n\nClauses 1 to 7 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClause 8 -\n\nMr Lim Kim San: Sir, I beg to move, In page 6, after line 28, to insert -\n\n\"(b) a person to replace any fuse in premises used for residential purposes, not being a fuse belonging to the Board;\".\n\nSir, under the Bill house owners are prohibited from changing fuses in their houses themselves. This provision is considered too restrictive and difficult to enforce. The amendment will allow house owners to perform simple opera-\n\ntions, such as changing an electric bulb or replacing an electric fuse in dwellings.\n\nAmendment agreed to.\n\nThe Chairman: As a result of this amendment, there are consequential amendments to be made to re-letter paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) to (c), (d) and (e) respectively. This will be done.\n\nClause 8, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClauses 9 to 13 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nBill considered in Committee; reported with an amendment; read a Third time and passed. PUBLIC UTILITIES (AMENDMENT) BILL: Order for Second Reading read.\n\n3.50 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nSir, the principal amendments proposed in this Bill relate to Part V of the principal Act. Not only are substantial amendments proposed to the existing Part V dealing with the licensing of eiectrical and supply installation (as defined) but a new Part VA is also proposed, which provides for the licensing of water service workers, such as plumbers.\n\nWhile drafting the Electricity Regulations, under sections 62 and 88 of the Public Utilities Act, the Public Utilities Board recognised the necessity for recommending amendments to Part V. This Part, as it stands, is limited in its application to private electrical generating plant. The increasing use of electricity in major industries, highrise buildings and shopping complexes poses the problem of ensuring the periodical inspection of electrical installations. The necessity for legislation in this regard is dictated primarily by safety considerations in places of all public concourse. This is further underlined by the recent recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Robinson's Departmental Store fire.\n\nThe Commission's first recommendation, Sir, is that for electrical installations of a stipulated higher current rating, consideration be given by the Public Utilities Board to grade the licensing of electrical workers with a view to ensuring that only personnel with the requisite professional expertise and experience be allowed to undertake such work. This has been taken into account in the Electrical Workers and Contractors Licensing Bill, 1974, which is now before the House.\n\nIn proposing these amendments, Sir, full consideration has also been given to the second recommendation, that is, for a system of periodic inspection of places of public concourse so that the appropriate authorities may be aware of unauthorised additions or alterations which might endanger the safety of the public.\n\nThe amendments proposed to Part V of the Act are significant in that they would have the effect of making it mandatory for all electrical installations, including private electrical generating plants except those owned and operated by the Board, Government, other statutory authorities, or those used exclusively for domestic purposes, to be licensed and to be supervised or operated by such class of licensed electrical workers as are prescribed in the Electrical Workers and Contractors Licensing Bill, 1974, and ensure also that-\n\n(a) a licensee of an installation must cause an installation to be inspected at such intervals as the B'oard may deem necessary;\n\n(b) an inspection as required by a licensee must be carried out by such licensed electrical worker as the Board may direct; on completion of the inspection a Certificate as to the fitness of the installation for licensing purposes must be issued by a licensed electrical worker;\n\n(c) specified procedures are observed in case of dangerous defects in installations;\n\n(d) serious accidents and the investigation thereof are reported;\n\n(e) installations existing before the\n\ncommencement of the amending Act are subject to the Act and the Regulations.\n\nSir, although the Board at the present time does operate an administrative system of registering plumbers, it lacks the legal power to regulate the duties and responsibilities of such plumbers. A new Part VA has accordingly been introduced into the Act to remedy this deficiency. A licence granted to a water service worker will specify the scope of the water service work to be carried out and any restrictions in regard to the type of work, or class of water service installation, or the circumstances or manner in which the holder of the licence may perform water service work. New definitions of \"water service installation\", \"water service work\" and \"water service worker\" have been included in this Part.\n\nSection 19 (3) of the Act, as it stands, does not empower the Board to enforce any limitation of supply or to cut off supply made necessary in the public interest. The need for amending this subsection became clear when consideration was being given to the introduction of surcharges in the Tariff Regulations by which the Board sought to limit consumption of electricity to consumers, and in the event of any consumer exceeding that limitation to impose a surcharge. Under the existing provisions, the Board would not be able to cut off the supply of electricity to offenders who flagrantly disregard the limitation of consumption without prosecuting them. Subsection 19 (3) of the Act has, therefore, been amended to confer that power on the Board in this situation or in other situations in which the interests of the public are affected. Again, Sir, a new subsection (4) has been inserted in section 19 to enable the Board to cut off the supply of electricity to any person who operates an electrical or supply installation without a licence.\n\nThe other amendments appearing in the Bill have the effect of increasing the penalties for contravention of the Act. The existing penalties have not been changed since 1963 and have therefore ceased to be realistic as a deterrent.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion proposed.\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Mr Speaker, Sir, 1 would like to ask a point of information from the Minister. Since the Bill requires every electrician, wireman, and so on, to be registered or qualified before he could handle any electrical work, may I know whether there is any examination board where people who seek to be qualified electricians can be tested?\n\nMr Lim Kim San: Sir, there are many institutions which conduct courses in electricity. It may lead to a degree, diploma, or a certificate. We on our part have carried out certain examinations in the past - and I think we will continue to do so - to prove that a person who is to be licensed is at least competent to handle electrical work. But we now have the vocational institutes, the Polytechnic, and the University, and I think they should be able to turn out enough electrical workers for our needs.\n\nMr Ho See Beng: Sir, this information is not enough to satisfy me. At the moment, there are a lot of experienced wiremen, and if this Bill is passed then these people will not be allowed to handle any electrical work. So they want to find out whether there is any examination board to which they can go for a test in order to qualify as licensed electrical workers. Otherwise they will be stranded the moment this Bill is passed.\n\nMr Lim Kim San: Sir, I do not know if the hon. Member for Bras Basah was present just now when I made my Second Reading speech on the Electrical Workers and Contractors Licensing Bill, but just in case he was not present or that he was not listening, I would like to repeat what I said just now. We have already got 732 licensed persons who in our view are competent to handle electrical work, and this figure excludes 951 contractors. If there are in existence people who feel that they are competent\n\nenough to do such work, then I think they should be wise enough to get themselves registered. And if they are left out, obviously they are incompetent.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\n\nThe House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Kim San].\n\nBill considered in Committee. [MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR]\n\nClauses 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClause 4 -\n\nMr Lim Kim San: Sir, I beg to move, In page 10, line 35, to leave out \"injury\" and insert \"damage\".\n\nSir, this amendment is to rectify a typographical error.\n\nAmendment agreed to.\n\nClause 4, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nClauses 5 to 11 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\n\nBill reported with an amendment; read a Third time and passed.\n\nNEWSPAPER AND PRINTING PRESSES BILL (As reported from Select Committee)\n\nOrder for Third Reading read.\n\n4.02 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Third time.\"\n\nThe Bill that is now before the House was sent to Select Committee and the report of the Select Committee has been circulated to all Members. There is, accordingly, no need for me to go through this Bill clause by clause as no doubt hon. Members would have read this report of the Select Committee. There are, however, certain important recommendations in the report of the Select Committee which I would like to bring to the attention of Members.\n\nIn my view, one of the most important recommendations made by the Select Committee is in respect of the proposed management shares that will have to be issued by newspapers required to go public. These will have to be paid for at the prevailing market price of the ordinary shares of a newspaper company, that is, such price as would prevail at the date of the issue of the management shares. It follows, accordingly, that if a particular company's shares are quoted on the Stock Exchange, it is the market price ruling on that day that would be taken as the value to be attached to management shares so issued. Where, however, the company's shares are not so quoted, there would be no ready yardstick which can be applied. The recommendation of the Select Committee, therefore, is that such shares of unquoted companies would be issued at such fair and reasonable value as may be determined by the Minister. In order that the valuation of such shares may not be arbitrarily imposed, it has been suggested that that valuation be made subject to review by the courts. Accordingly, the Bill in accordance with the Select Committee's recommendation, now makes the Minister's valuation subject to appeal to the courts. Even without such provision in the law, I would like to assure hon. Members that such valuation as may be given by the Minister would have to be based on expert advice from persons such as qualified accountants who would be required to go through recent accounts and annual reports of newspapers. The Minister would also have in mind various other considerations such as up-to-date valuations of immovable property, machinery, fixtures and fitting of a newspaper company when seeking to arrive at a fair and reasonable valuation of such shares. However, with this specific provision allowing shareholders of newspaper companies, or the companies themselves to seek such redress as they may require on valuation, there should be adequate safeguards against arbitrary values placed upon these unquoted shares of companies involved.\n\nThe second recommendation of the Select Committee which I would like to touch upon is in regard to the greater voting rights conferred on management shareholders. Such superior voting rights can only be used in respect of any resolution touching upon the appointment or dismissal of any director or any member of the staff of a newspaper company. In regard to other matters, the holder of management shares will rank pan passu with the holder of ordinary shares of a company. This recommendation gives effect to Government's declared policy that it is not its intention to upset the commercial operations of newspaper companies nor to interfere in the routine management of newspapers.\n\nAnother useful recommendation of the Select Committee is the transitional provisions contained in clause 36 of the Bill. As in all probability some newspapers that are required to go public will find it difficult, if not impossible, to comply with all the provisions of this Act before it comes into operation, it is thought necessary that transitional provisions be inserted. It is to provide for the possibility of newspaper companies finding it difficult to suitably amend their memorandum and articles of association in time and to the satisfaction of the Registrar of Newspapers, and to accommodate them in regard to other procedural requirements which they might have to comply in the issue of shares, these transitional provisions have been devised. Although ample notice has been given to the newspapers of Government's intention to require newspapers in Singapore to become public limited companies, it is to ensure that such requirements that may be imposed may not unduly interfere with the ordinary business of a newspaper, that these transitional provisions have been inserted. To this end, clause 36 of the Bill in particular provides that the chief editor of any newspaper required to comply with the requirements of Part III of this Act shall be granted a permit authorising the publication of a newspaper up to and\n\nincluding 30th June, 1975, on the undertaking by the chief editor of such newspaper in writing that he will convert his newspaper into a newspaper company. Even so, any newspaper that is unable to meet this deadline of 30th June, 1975, may apply for further period or periods of extension, subject to such conditions as the Minister may see fit to impose.\n\nLastly, the Select Committee has recommended that appeal should lie to the President in respect of every decision made by the Minister in the exercise of discretionary powers, for example, whether to refuse or grant his approval under Part III of the Act or whether to grant or refuse further extensions of time under clause 36. It is hoped that this will allay any fears of the Minister acting arbitrarily when exercising his powers of discretion under the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that the committal of this Bill to a Select Committee has provided an opportunity for interested parties to air their views. It has enabled the Select Committee to recommend some very important and useful amendments. The Bill as amended is in conformity with Government's declared policy. I would like to assure Members that the Government has no intention whatsoever of taking over the press nor does it want to upset the commercial operations of any newspaper. The sole purpose of this legislation is, and I emphasise, merely to safeguard our national interest and the well-being of our citizens by preventing our newspapers from being used as instruments for subversion.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

AMENDMENT OF STANDING ORDERS: 4.16 p.m.\n\nThe Leader of the House (Mr E. W. Barker): Sir, I beg to move,\n\nThat Standing Order No. 95 (2) be amended by deleting the words \"as Parliament may refer to the Committee\" appearing in the tenth line thereof and substituting therefor the words \"as the Committee may think fit\".\n\nSir, the Government has accepted certain proposals of the Auditor-General for improving on the accountability of statutory institutions. One proposal recommends that Statements of Accounts of such institutions which are laid before Parliament be examined by the Public Accounts Committee. However, under paragraph (2) of Standing Order No. 95, only accounts showing the appropriation of the sums granted by Parliament to meet public expenditure and laid before Parliament stand referred to the Public Accounts Committee for examination.\n\nTo implement this proposal the Public Accounts Committee, in paragraph 12 of its Second Report to Parliament as contained in Paper Parl. 3 of 1973, recommended that an appropriate amendment be made to the Standing Order. The amendment suggested in my Motion is to give effect to the Committee's recommendation. Moreover, it is so worded as to give the Committee discretion in the selection of accounts for examination.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nMr Speaker: The Motion stands referred to the Standing Orders Committee under the provisions of paragraph 4 (b) of Standing Order No. 95.ADJOURNMENT: Resolved,\n\n\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr Barker].\n\nAdjourned accordingly at Twenty minutes past Four o'clock p.m, to a date to be fixed.", "url": "https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/#/report?sittingdate=28-08-1974"}
