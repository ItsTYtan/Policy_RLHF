Rahim Ishak (Siglap), Minister of State for Foreign Affairs - from 5th to 10th April, 1971.\n\nMr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol) from 7th to 18th April, 1971.\n\nYEOH GHIM SENG Speaker, Parliament of Singapore\n\n[MR SPEAKER IN THE CHAIR] ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND DEPOSITS (Purchase of private houses by middle income group)\n\n1. Mr Cheong Yuen Chee asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour, in view of the fact that the Housing and Development Board is unable to fully meet the housing needs of workers in the middle income group, if he will consider allowing this category\n\nof workers to utilise their Central Provident Fund deposits to purchase private houses built by reputable building societies.\n\nThe Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Central Provident Fund Board approved housing scheme regulations were introduced in August 1968 to enable members of the C.P.F. to purchase Housing and Development Board flats and houses under the home-ownership scheme of the Housing and Development Board.\n\nIn March 1970 the regulations were extended to include the home-ownership scheme of the Jurong Town Corporation. The Housing Board is now allowing families with a combined income of $1,200 per month to use their C.P.F. deposits to purchase Housing Board flats. This ceiling will be raised to $1,500 per month as from July this year.\n\nIt is true that applicants for Housing Board flats have to wait quite a long time because the demand for public housing exceeds the supply. The long waiting period is not confined only to applicants from the middle income group, but those from the lower income group also have to wait for their flats.\n\nIt is not intended to extend the C.P.F. approved housing scheme regulations to allow C.P.F. members from the middle income group to purchase private houses built by building societies. This policy may be reviewed in five years' time, depending on the housing position then and the Housing and Development Board building capacity as it grows in the next few years.\n\nMr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah): Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that there are people who have been on the waiting list for Housing Board flats for two years or even more, will the Minister care to review the position so that not only the middle income group but also the lower income group can utilise their C.P.F. deposits to buy private houses?\n\nMr Sia Kah Hui: Sir, when I said \"review\", of course, I meant a review of the whole picture. It need not be confined to the middle income group only.\n\nRE-ROUTING OF BUS ROUTES TO CENTRAL BUS STATIONS IN CITY AREA\n\n2. Mr Ng Kah Ting asked the Minister for Communications if his Ministry has made a feasibility study on the establishment of two or more central bus stations in the City area\n\nand the re-routing of bus routes where practicable to one or other of the bus stations so that commuters to and from the City will not have to change buses.\n\nThe Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin): Mr Speaker, Sir, the bus transport system is of a flexible nature by which passengers can be conveniently loaded and unloaded at very close intervals along the routes, unlike a rail or other mass transport system. The need, therefore, for a concentrated passenger stop, where passengers unload and walk to their destination, is not considered necessary. Nevertheless, in the bus reorganisation plan a number of high capacity bus stops in the City area, for example, in Market Street, Cecil Street, Empress Place, Collyer Quay, Prince Edward Road, which is just opposite the Singapore Polytechnic, are provided to cater for the needs of the majority of commuters who concentrate in this area.\n\nThe proposed re-routing of services has also been designed so as to provide direct links between major residential areas with the City area, namely, Collyer Quay, Shenton Way, Robinson Road, Chinatown, North Bridge Road, Victoria Street, High Street, and Orchard Road. Furthermore, a series of re-routes and inter-urban services also provide direct links between major residential and industrial areas. This arrangement of services should enable the majority of bus commuters to complete their journeys without changing buses or, at most, with only one transfer.\n\nCOMPLAINTS AGAINST CIVIL SERVANTS OF DISCOURTESY (Conduct of courtesy courses)\n\n3. Mr Ng Kah Ting asked the Minister for Finance (a) the number of complaints made against civil servants who have been discourteous and impolite to members of the public during the period 1st January, 1969 up to the latest convenient date; (b) whether courses on\n\ncourtesy have been organised for civil servants and, if so, (i) how many courses have been held; and (ii) how many and what categories of civil servants participated in them; and (c) whether more such courses will be conducted.\n\nThe Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance): Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of complaints of discourtesy of civil servants received by the Central Complaints Bureau during the period 1st January, 1969, to 8th February, 1971, is 154. Out of this, 118 complaints were not substantiated.\n\nGovernment is aware of the need to conduct courses on courtesy for civil servants, and such courses have been held regularly in the past. Since January 1969, 10 Customs officers, 12 Immigration officers and 12 Health officers have attended a \"First Course in Courtesy\". About 24 Administrative officers are currently undergoing an intermediate training course, which includes a course on public relations at the Staff Training institute.\n\nMore courses on courtesy are being planned. A courtesy course for about 20 personal assistants, telephone operators, receptionists and counter clerks is scheduled to begin some time next month. Another course for Division II and III officers is to be held at the National Youth Leadership Training Institute on 28th April, 1971. The course will include lectures on \"Essentials of human relations\" and discussions and role-play sessions on how to deal with members of the public.\n\nIt is intended to conduct training courses which will include courtesy to members of the public similar to the course which Administrative Officers are currently undergoing, for other Division I officers in departments which come into constant contact with the public, such as those in the Foreign, Immigration, Customs and Postal Services.\n\nFORTY-TWO HOUR WEEK FOR CIVIL SERVANTS (Evaluation of benefits)\n\n4. Mr Ng Kah Ting asked the Minister for Finance if it is feasible for his Ministry to evaluate what benefit has been derived from the introduction of the 42-hour week, by the increase of an hour per day, in all sectors of the civil service, and whether any inconvenience has been encountered by civil servants by the change in the times of arrival at, and departure from work.\n\nMr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not possible to quantify the benefits of the changed working hours. However, the fact that offices are now open from 8.00 a.m, to 5.00 p.m, on weekdays except Saturdays, instead of from 9.00 a.m, to 4.30 p.m. as before, means an improved service to the public in the sense that they now have more time to visit these offices to get their affairs attended to.\n\nNo survey has been conducted and it is, therefore, not known definitely whether any inconvenience has been encountered by civil servants by the change. As far as can be judged, it would appear that while some civil servants did encounter some inconvenience in the beginning in adjusting to the new routine, all of them by and large are now used to the changed hours of work.\n\nCONSIDERATION OF MORE THAN ONE ITEM OF SUPPLY BUSINESS\n\nResolved,\n\nThat, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, the second and third readings of the Supply Bill for the financial year 1st April, 1971, to 31st March, 1972 and the Supplementary Supply Bill, 1971, be taken today.\" [Mr Hon Sui Sen]. SUPPLY BILL: Order for Second and Third Readings\n\n2.41 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\n\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe Main Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for the financial year 1st April, 1971, to 31st March, 1972, have been considered and approved by the House as Cmd. Paper No. 3 of 1971. Under section 85 of the Constitution of Singapore, heads of expenditure other than statutory expenditure to be met from the Consolidated Fund have to be included in a Bill to be known as the Supply Bill. The purpose of such a Bill is to provide for the issue from the Consolidated Fund of the sums necessary to meet the expenditure and the appropriation of these sums for the purposes specified therein.\n\nThe Supply Bill before Members is to give legislative approval for the issue of funds from the Consolidated Fund to meet the sums of expenditure for the financial year 1st April. 1971, to 31st March, 1972. In the Schedule to the Bill are shown the various heads of expenditure and the sums that may be incurred in respect of each head. These have been approved by the House in the Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1st April, 1971, to 31st March, 1972, and appear in pages 51 and 52 of Cmd. Paper 3 of 1971.\n\nOnce the Supply Bill is approved, I will be empowered to issue warrants authorising expenditure up to the amount under each head as shown in the Bill to be paid out from the Consolidated Fund.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time. Third Reading\n\nMr Speaker: Mr Hon, will you please move the Third Reading?\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Third time.\"\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Third time and passed*. * President's assent, see Appendix at cols. 1459-60.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY SUPPLY BILL: Order for Second and Third Readings read.\n\n2.43 p.m.\n\nThe Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\n\nThe purpose of this Bill is to provide statutory authority in accordance with clause 2 of Article 85 and clause 2 of Article 87 of the Constitution of Singapore for additional provisions for expenditure in excess of the provisions for expenditure authorised by the Supply Act. 1970. These additional sums have been scheduled as Supplementary Estimates which have been considered and approved by the House as Cmd. Paper 5 of 1971.\n\nSir, I beg to move.\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Second time. Third Reading\n\nMr Hon Sui Sen: Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Third time.\"\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nBill accordingly read a Third time and passed+. + President's assent, see Appendix at cols. 1459-60\n\nADJOURNMENT SINE DIE: 2.45 p.m.\n\nThe Leader of the House (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have come to the end of a long session and Members of this House have asked me to express and record a vote of thanks to you, Sir, and the members of your staff.\n\nHon. Members: Hear, hear!\n\nMr Barker: Sir, your Clerks have been of considerable assistance to Members and have always rendered service with a smile. Your interpreters have been coherent, though their interpretation has had to be simultaneous. Your Parliamentary reporters have, within 24 hours, produced highly accurate copies of proceedings for the benefit of Members, and Hansard has always been prepared and printed with expediency. Above all, Sir, you have treated some Members so kindly, dealt with others most tolerantly, and been patient and understanding throughout every sitting. Sir, I beg to move, \"That Parliament do now adjourn sine die.\"\n\nMr Speaker: Honourable Members, I do not think there is any need for me to say anything except that it has been a pleasure listening to some of you. And I am sure my Clerks, interpreters, reporters, and I myself have learnt a lot about what to say and what not to say!\n\nQuestion put, and agreed to.\n\nResolved,\n\nThat Parliament do now adjourn sine die.\n\nAdjourned accordingly sine die at Thirteen minutes to Three o'clock p.m.\n\nASSENTS TO BILLS PASSED: The following Bills, which were passed by Parliament on 29th March, 1971, were assented to by the President on 30th March, 1971;\n\n(i) Supply Bill and\n\n(ii) Supplementary Supply Bill.", "url": "https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/#/report?sittingdate=29-03-1971"}
