      "subTitle": null,
      "sectionType": "OA",
      "content": "<p>1 <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Transport (a) whether more measures can be put in place to detect non-compliant active mobility devices (AMDs) considering the increased incidence of AMD-related fires in 2024; (b) whether enforcement officers are adequately trained to identify modifications on non-compliant AMDs during spot-checks; (c) whether the frequency of spot checks on shops that repair or sell AMDs can be increased; and (d) whether more stringent penalties can be imposed to deter illegal modifications, especially for repeat offenders.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we adopt a multi-pronged approach in the enforcement against non-compliant active mobility devices (AMDs).</p><p>First, we work closely with Singapore Customs, and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to curb the inflow of non-compliant AMDs into Singapore.</p><p>Second, our enforcement officers conduct operations daily to enforce against non-compliant devices on paths, as well as retailers selling non-compliant devices. Our officers undergo regular training to be updated on the latest violation trends, and are equipped with a variety of detection tools. Most recently, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) conducted an ambush operation in Punggol and seized four non-compliant AMDs. We will continue to conduct regular and targeted enforcement operations.</p><p>Third, we require e-scooters, which are required to be registered for use, to undergo inspections every two years to ensure compliance with regulations.</p><p>Fourth, we impose significant penalties on illegal modifications of AMDs for deterrence, given the risks they pose. All offenders, including first-time offenders, will be taken to court. Individuals who are first-time offenders are liable for a fine of up to $20,000 or an imprisonment term of up to 24 months, or both, while retailers who are first-time offenders are liable for fines up to $40,000. Repeat offenders are liable for higher fines and/or imprisonment terms.</p><p>We will continue to review regulations relating to AMDs, to enhance fire safety and deter the sale, purchase and use of non-compliant devices.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his response. I have several Yio Chu Kang residents coming to me, expressing concerns about AMDs and fires related to AMDs.</p><p>Considering the role that retailers, repair shops and especially online shops play in the modification and maintenance of AMDs, how does the Ministry determine the current frequency of inspections for these establishments? What criteria are being used to assess compliance and are there plans to increase inspection frequency or implement additional measures to ensure adherence to safety standards? And lastly, what is being done to ensure compliance of safe devices being sold by online retailers?</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng</strong>: Sir, LTA has enhanced enforcement operations. In particular, for retailer operations, the number of operations mounted over the years has increased; in fact, it has increased four-folds, in 2022 compared to 2024. So, we will continue our efforts.</p><p>The challenge is with online retailers. As the Member has rightly pointed out, it is difficult for us to go after or to track what people are selling or buying online. However, we will be introducing regulations for online marketplace platforms and shops, in respect of non-compliant devices. We will share more later this year and we hope that this would help us in our efforts against sale, purchase and use of non-compliant devices.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Dr Tan.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>: I thank the Ministry of Transport (MOT) for sharing that there are plans to introduce regulations to address the issue of online shops selling AMDs that are in breach and unsafe. Can I ask MOT whether as part of the regulation review, they will be looking at how liability is assigned when a device has been purchased from an online shop, and let us say subsequently, there is a fire. In short, does the Ministry agree that the liability should not be any different regardless of whether the item was bought from an online retailer or from an offline, brick and mortar real world retailer? Because the fire burns as hot and as damaging, regardless of where the defective product came from.</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng</strong>: When we look at reviewing the regulations against online retailers, we look at how we can align the rules that we apply on brick and mortar retailers as well. If a retailer knowingly sells a non-compliant device or an illegally modified device, the retailer must be held responsible. But if the purchaser subsequently modifies the device, then the purchaser or the owner of the device must be responsible. In cases where we are able to investigate and conclude which is the party that is responsible for the illegal modifications, the relevant party will be taken to task.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Dennis Tan.</p><p><strong>\tMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his answers. The Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned about actions against retailers. I have two supplementary questions. One is regarding these retailers. In the past,&nbsp;I believe in the previous Committees of Supply or Bills, I have suggested for the Government to take action at the Customs level, when retailers import illegal AMDs. Can I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to update the House on what efforts are being taken to stop the import of illegal AMDs at our border?</p><p>Secondly, can I ask the Government to consider allocating more budget and resources to LTA for better enforcement efforts and better public education efforts against non-compliant AMDs?&nbsp;Whether in terms of fire risk or when they are in use generally in the public, for example. Because we still see that there are many non-compliant devices being used on the road, for example, those using throttle or those with weight issues and also illegal speed modification, and bearing in mind that LTA will also be requiring more resources soon as they seek to enforce the new regulations on mobility scooters.</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, indeed, as said in my reply, we work closely with the Customs and ICA to curb the import of such devices. In fact, we have forfeited devices that were unauthorised imports, whether by companies or individuals. So, we work with our border agencies to do that.</p><p>Yes, I thank the Member for also asking for more resources for LTA to mount all these operations on the paths, in the public spaces to catch users or the use of non-compliant devices.&nbsp;We will do our best with our limited resources. We will tap on technology, whether speed cameras, surveillance cameras, devices, tools to be able to help our enforcement officers to do their work better and more efficiently.</p>",

      "title": "Reasons for Rise in Recidivism Rate at Drug Rehabilitation Centre Inmates",
      "subTitle": null,
      "sectionType": "OA",
      "content": "<p>2 <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Home Affairs in view of the two-year recidivism rate for inmates released from drug rehabilitation centres (DRCs) reaching the highest since 2015 (a) what factors have contributed to the rise in the recidivism rate; (b) whether the Ministry is reviewing the effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes within DRCs; and (c) where do drug abusers obtain their supplies from and whether the increased accessibility to drugs has contributed to the increase in recidivism rate.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Home Affairs)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the recidivism rate is influenced by many factors, including the extent of the ex-offender’s family or peer support after their release into the community, as well as their ability to remain gainfully employed.</p><p>In 2019, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) changed the drug rehabilitation regime such that abusers who are arrested for the third and subsequent times are sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) for rehabilitation, instead of being prosecuted and subject to an extended imprisonment term. Since this change, the proportion of repeat drug abusers in the DRC release cohorts has increased from about 35% for the 2020 release cohort to 54% for the 2022 release cohort. Repeat drug abusers have a higher likelihood of reoffending and this may have contributed to the increase in the recidivism rate of DRC inmates.</p><p>Singapore Prison Service (SPS) regularly reviews the DRC regime to ensure it remains effective in addressing the drug abusers’ risks and needs. For example, to better prepare drug abusers for release, SPS recently established the Re-integration Hub to centralise the pre-emplacement regime for drug abusers who are scheduled for release on community-based programmes.</p><p>Drug abusers obtain drugs from various sources, including through platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp. To curb the accessibility and supply of drugs into Singapore, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) regularly orders online platforms to take down material advertising the sale of controlled drugs and takes tough action against drug traffickers as well as syndicates operating from overseas. Last year, CNB dismantled 25 drug syndicates and made significant drug seizures with an estimated market value of about $13.5 million. CNB will continue with its robust enforcement efforts&nbsp;to stem the supply of drugs and keep Singapore drug-free.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister of State for his reply. The Minister of State mentioned that repeat drug abusers have a higher likelihood of reoffending. What are two-year recidivism rates of those with drug antecedents compared to those without drug antecedents? And recognising that re-integration into society is critical for preventing relapse, what post-release support systems are currently in place&nbsp;for former DRC inmates and how does the Ministry collaborate with community organisations to ensure continuous support? And are there plans to expand these initiatives?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>: Sir, I thank the Member for the supplementary question. Indeed, based on the two-year recidivism rate,&nbsp;inmates with previous drug antecedents are approximately three times more likely to reoffend than those without.</p><p>If you look at the release cohorts over five years, you can see that the recidivism rates are also different, about three times more. When we look at the recidivism rate for the release cohort in 2018,&nbsp;for those with drug antecedents, it was 29.9%. For release cohort 2019, it was 27.4%. For release cohort 2020, it was 26.9%. For release cohort 2021, it was 29.2%. For release cohort 2022, it was 29.7%.</p><p>And if you look at those without drug antecedents, so, for the 2018 cohort, with drug antecedents, it was 29.9%, and without drug antecedents, it was 11.6%. For 2019, with drug antecedents, it was 27.4%, compared to without&nbsp;drug antecedents, it was 9.8%. For 2020, with drug antecedents, it was 26.9%, without drug antecedents, it was 9.4%. For release cohort 2021, with drug antecedents, it was 29.2%, and without drug antecedents, it was 9.4%. And the recent one, for release cohort 2022, with drug antecedents, it was 29.7%, and without drug antecedents, it was 9.8%.</p><p>So, with this we know the harms that drugs do to individuals. That is why we go upstream to work with the community to see how we can prevent anyone, even one person, from taking drugs, because we know drugs are harmful.</p><p>We have extensive preventive drug education programmes and then, recently, we launched the Inter-Ministry Committee on Drug Prevention for Youths, and we have organisations coming onboard to help us with&nbsp;Dadah Itu Haram programmes. It is about reaching out to the community so that we can help our people to stay away from drugs.</p><p>This is important. I hope that we can get support from the House as well as society here in Singapore, fellow Singaporeans, because when you do not have a tough stance on drugs, it will seep into the society, it will break the society, destroy the society. Many of my counterparts that I have met overseas shared with me, without them knowing, some of their countries have become a narco-state.</p><p>So, we want to make sure we help Singaporeans to have avenues for a pro-social quality of life. What is key is that we must make sure that while there are those who just do drug abusing, consumption, but we have seen how drug consumption have led to criminal activities.&nbsp;So, when someone is arrested, not only for drug consumption, but with some criminality aspect, it gets difficult and it gets more complicated. It will destroy the families, it will destroy the society, not only the individual.&nbsp;So, I hope that we can work together on this.</p><p>While there are those who have been arrested for consumption or any related drug antecedent, we want to help them. Essentially, that is why we have the Re-integration Hub, where we bring in programmes relating to employment, relating to how they can improve their social esteem and also how they can feel they have a sense of belonging. There are also religious programmes at the Re-integration Hub.</p><p>We also have organisations, platforms like the Yellow Ribbon Community Project, Malay/Muslim Organisations Rehabilitation Network, Prison Fellowship, Hindu Centre, coming on board to help us. Recently, we also roll out the Desistor Network to get these desistors to play a part in this effort. It is about enhancing all these efforts together so that we will continue to support them, even though they have taken drugs. They have abused drugs, they have committed an offence, but we want to provide them with second chances, so that they can build up their lives for better days ahead.</p>",

      "subTitle": null,
      "sectionType": "OA",
      "content": "<p>3 <strong>Ms Joan Pereira</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Home Affairs in view of the number of people killed and injured in traffic accidents in 2024 at a five-year high (a) what are the profiles of speeding motorists in terms of age, gender, nationality, years of driving experience and types of vehicles driven; (b) whether public education and penalties can be adapted to target groups at higher risks of offending; (c) what are the main reasons for speeding violations; and (d) what new measures will be considered to reduce drink-driving incidents.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>\tThe Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Home Affairs)</strong>: Sir, based on the data on speeding violations in 2024, males, Singapore Citizens and those driving cars are disproportionately represented amongst speeding offenders. As for age, nothing stands out. The Traffic Police (TP) does not track the data based on years of driving experience.</p><p>TP collaborates with community partners to conduct public education campaigns for different road user groups. For example, we have the annual Anti-Drink Drive campaign and Singapore Road Safety Month campaign, with the latter, focusing on a different theme every year, depending on the traffic trends.</p><p>TP complements this with engagement of vulnerable road users, such as elderly pedestrians and children, with different campaigns addressing the specific behaviours of each group. As for the penalty framework, those who commit multiple offences or are recalcitrant offenders can expect to receive higher penalties.</p><p>Egregious offenders are more likely to face prosecution in court instead of being offered composition. In addition, the Road Traffic Act mandates heavier penalties, such as suspension of licence and mandatory minimum sentences for certain profiles of repeat offenders.</p><p>TP does not track the reasons for speeding. That said, commonly cited excuses include the lack of awareness of the speed limit or of the speed at which the motorist was travelling, and urgency to reach to reach appointments.</p><p>Drink driving is a major concern for TP. To tackle this, we increased our penalties in 2019 with mandatory imprisonment and mandatory disqualification of licence for dangerous and careless driving offences, if the offenders were under the influence of alcohol. TP has also intensified enforcement against drink driving. In addition, we are reviewing the maximum allowable breath and blood alcohol concentration limits and will announce the details when ready.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Pereira.</p><p><strong>\tMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Speaker. I have two supplementary questions for the Minister of State. I would like to ask, first whether the red-light cameras have been effective in improving the enforcement of speeding offences since 1 April 2024. Second, what are the state of progress and future plans for the island wide roll-out of using red-light cameras to detect speeding offences, if the red light cameras are effective?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. Indeed, TP's use of the red-light cameras with the speeding enforcement function has been effective in deterring speeding.</p><p>If Members can remember, at the initial part, there was an initial increase in speeding violations at red light camera locations where the speed enforcement function was activated. But we saw a gradual decrease over time. So, we are pleased that people are more cognisant of the fact that they need to be careful, they need to make sure that they practise road safety habits and so forth.</p><p>So, with this in mind, we will also continue to activate the speed enforcement function on more red-light cameras in 2025 and at the same time, we will also do more enforcement work on the ground.</p>",

      "title": "Tightening Regulations on Digital Payment Token Service Providers",
      "subTitle": null,
      "sectionType": "OA",
      "content": "<p>4 <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what are the Government's key considerations in deciding to tighten regulations for digital payment token service providers, including the prohibition of payments via locally issued credit cards; and (b) what is the anticipated impact on younger consumers, particularly those aged 18 to 25, who are increasingly adopting the use of cryptocurrencies.</p><p><strong> The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth and Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and speculative in nature and are usually not anchored on any fundamental value. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has consistently issued public warnings that dealing in cryptocurrencies is hazardous, highly risky and not suitable for the general public.</p><p>If an individual uses his credit card to purchase cryptocurrencies, he could be borrowing from the credit card, which attracts a higher rate of interest than other forms of credit. If the value of the cryptocurrencies fall, he may suffer substantial losses and be unable to pay off his credit card debt, with the higher rate of interest compounding his debt.</p><p>More generally, using credit or leverage magnifies losses and investors can lose more than the principal amount they put in. MAS has therefore prohibited digital payment token service providers from providing credit or leverage to all retail customers, regardless of age, for the purchase of cryptocurrencies. This includes restrictions on their acceptance of credit cards.</p><p>MAS cautions that regulatory measures cannot insulate consumers from losses associated with the inherently speculative and highly risky nature of cryptocurrencies. Consumers should steer clear of cryptocurrencies.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip Hon Weng.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for his reply. What is MAS' view on banning cryptocurrencies and will it lead to consumers going underground? And given that individuals aged 18 to 25 are increasingly adopting cryptocurrencies, what specific factors did the Ministry consider regarding this demographic when formulating these regulations? And how does the Ministry plan to address these unique financial literacy and risk exposure challenges faced by younger consumers?</p><p><strong>\tMr Alvin Tan</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I thank Mr Yip for his supplementary questions. I will start with the second one, and that is, the Government will continue to step up communications to warn consumers of all ages on the hazardous nature and the highly risky, volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. And that does not just apply to the youths, but it also applies to any consumer who deals with cryptocurrencies.</p><p>On the broader perspective of what MAS' views are on cryptocurrency, MAS seeks to foster an innovative and responsible digital asset ecosystem. But this is very different, and there is a sharp distinction that we need to draw between growing an innovative and responsible digital asset ecosystem, and the distinction between that and speculation in cryptocurrency, which MAS has consistently discouraged to the retail public.</p><p>With regard to the banning of cryptocurrencies, the Member would understand and realise that cryptocurrency trading and services are cross border in nature. And so, such a prohibition may be unlikely to be effective in limiting its harms. In fact, as the Member alluded to, imposing a prohibition could likely lead to some consumers turning to unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges to access cryptocurrency services, where consumers might not be properly informed of the risks to make well-informed decisions. Therefore, to reduce the risk to consumers from speculative trading in cryptocurrencies, MAS requires that digital payment token service providers ensure proper business conduct and provide adequate risk disclosures.</p><p>In fact, these regulatory measures are comprehensive to reduce consumer harm in Singapore. They include consumer access provisions, business conduct provisions, as well as technology risk provisions. But our message is clear, it is consistent: consumers should steer clear of cryptocurrencies.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof James Lim, a short supplementary question to give the Minister of State time to answer.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>: Thank you, Speaker, for your indulgence. I had filed a crypto-related question yesterday about holdings by our Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs). I am wondering if I could follow-up a little little bit on that.</p><p>I fully agree with the Minister of State that for the retail investor, there are substantial risks. But I think there is an evolving understanding of the role of cryptocurrencies as a balancing asset, much like gold. And while I do not take any position about the utility of it in our SWF portfolios, I&nbsp;am wondering if MAS has a view about what it means for institutional investors, whether at the SWF level or institutional investors in the Singapore financial ecosystem.</p><p><strong>\tMr Alvin Tan</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I thank Assoc Prof James Lim for his question. I think that that question has been answered yesterday as a written Parliamentary Question, about that position. I also wanted to clarify with the Member what is his, and as well as the party's position, on cryptocurrency in general.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Lim, do you want to respond?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>:&nbsp;Sure, I am happy to explain that for me, I do not hold any inherent favour or not. But I would like to understand what cryptocurrency means for institutional investors, much like how we draw a distinction between encouraging retail investors with a certain kinds of asset investments, as opposed to institutional investors.</p><p><strong>\tMr Alvin Tan</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the answer was quite clear yesterday that our investment entities make professional investments decisions to take long-term orientation. And so, they invest in assets that are anchored to underlying economic fundamentals with the potential for long-term value increase. Cryptocurrencies do not fit this profile.</p><h6>11.30 am</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. End of Question Time.

(proc text)]</p><h6>11.31 pm</h6><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Minister Desmond Lee.</span></p><p><strong>The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee)</strong>: Mr Chairman, at the start of this term of Government, we faced significant challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was against this backdrop that I outlined the Ministry of National Development's (MND's) priorities during the Debate on the President's Address in 2020.</p><p>First, we committed to keep public housing affordable, accessible and inclusive. Second, we said that we will transform Singapore into a City in Nature, one that is more liveable and sustainable. Third, we would continue uplifting our Built Environment (BE) sector, to make it more productive and resilient.</p><p>We worked with colleagues, stakeholders and the community to deliver on these priorities. Today, I will speak on housing as well as the BE sector transformation. My colleague, Second Minister Indranee Rajah, will cover long-term planning for our city and support for our construction firms. Senior Minister of State Sim Ann will share our efforts to enhance our living environment. Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How will touch on how we are transforming Singapore into a City in Nature, and Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim will speak about what we are doing for lower-income households.</p><p>Let me start with our first priority: affordable and accessible housing. Over the past few years, we grappled with significant housing challenges. The pandemic severely impacted supply. Fear of housing delays also caused demand to spike.</p><p>At the same time, there was a broad-based increase in demand driven by changing social norms. Application rates for Build-To-Order (BTO) flats spiked and Housing and Development Board (HDB) resale prices rose sharply. We rolled out various measures over the last few years to address this supply-demand imbalance.</p><p>First, we pushed hard to complete the flats delayed by COVID-19. In January this year, HDB caught up on the delays and completed all 75,800 flats that were affected by the pandemic.</p><p>Second, we ramped up supply of new housing. We are on track to exceed our commitment to launch 100,000 BTO flats from 2021 to 2025. This is the equivalent of two Ang Mo Kio towns in less than five years, despite the pandemic.</p><p>Third, we brought down overall waiting times. We have shortened the median waiting times for BTO flats. In 2024, the median waiting time was less than four years, comparable to the pre-COVID-19 norm of three to four years. We had also previously committed that by 2025, we will build 2,000 to 3,000 shorter waiting time flats, which are flats with a waiting time of two-plus years.</p><p>We met this target one year ahead of schedule when we launched more than 2,800 shorter waiting time flats last year in 2024. As a result, BTO application rates for first-timer families have stabilised to below pre-COVID-19 levels, from 3.7 times in 2019 to 2.1 times in 2024. In the most recent February 2025 sales exercise, first-timer family application rates fell further to 1.5 times subscription. This means that first-timer families applying for BTO flats are more likely to receive an invitation to book a flat today than it was before the pandemic.</p><p>On the private housing front, we have increased supply through the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. In 2024, we released land for around 11,000 private housing units, which is the highest in a single year since 2013.</p><p>As a result, the private housing market started to ease in recent years. Private residential property prices increased by 3.9% in 2024, compared to 6.8% in 2023 and 8.6% in 2022, but we will keep pushing on to increase housing supply, to help more Singaporeans meet their housing needs.</p><p>This year, we will launch more than 25,000 flats. This includes 19,600 BTO flats and more than 5,500 Sale of Balance flats (SBF) flats. We will also raise private housing supply from the GLS programme to around 8,500 units in the first half of 2025, with more to come later this year. From 2025 to 2027, we will launch more than 50,000 BTO flats.</p><p>We will also continue to shorten waiting times. This year, we will launch another 3,800 Shorter Waiting Time flats (SWT). This means that 20% of all BTO flats launched this year in 2025 will be a SWT flat. We launched our largest ever SBF exercise last month, and we will be launching another SBF exercise later this year.</p><p>These flats will cover a wide range of locations. This year alone, HDB will be launching BTO flats in around 60% of our towns and estates. Singaporeans can also look forward to more flats in attractive locations, such as Mount Pleasant. With your permission, Mr Chairman, may I display some slides on the LED screens?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Go ahead. [<em>Slides were shown to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>: Thank you, Sir. The first of six BTO projects in Mount Pleasant will be launched in October 2025. The first Mount Pleasant project will be a sizeable development, with approximately 1,500 units of 2-room flexi to 4-room flats, including public rental flats. It will be near the future Mount Pleasant Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the Thomson East Coast Line. There will be an eating house and a supermarket within the precinct. Residents will be able to cycle to MacRitchie Reservoir to enjoy nature.</p><p>The Toa Payoh Town Centre and the future Toa Payoh Integrated Development will not be far away, with supermarkets, a polyclinic, a library, sports facilities and more. The new estate will be inspired by the area's rich heritage. Six buildings from the Old Police Academy have been conserved.</p><p>Even as we ramp up supply, we have kept new flats affordable. We have increased market subsidies for BTO flats to keep them affordable for households, with a wide range of incomes. We also raised the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) last year. First-timer families can now receive up to $120,000 in grants, with lower middle-income households getting more support.</p><p>As a result in 2024, more than eight in 10 first-timer families who collected keys to their BTO flats were able to service their HDB loans using their their Central Provident Fund (CPF), with little to no cash outlay. We have taken major steps to ensure that public housing in attractive locations like Mount Pleasant remain affordable. This also ensures that they remain inclusive, an important part of Singapore's social compact, so that Singaporeans of different backgrounds and income levels can live in the same neighbourhood.</p><p>At the same time, we need to reduce the lottery effect for those who successfully ballot for such flats, to keep the system of subsidies fair. This is something Miss Cheryl Chan had asked about. We took the first major step four years ago with the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model in 2021. In October last year, we took another big step with the new flat classification framework, categorising BTO projects into Standard, Plus and Prime. We will launch the first Mount Pleasant project as either Plus or Prime. This allows us to unlock new, choicier areas for affordable public housing.</p><p>Take the Redhill area near the MRT station, for example. It is currently built up with private residential properties etched in pink. These can be expensive as Redhill is a highly sought-after location. But HDB launched Alexandra Vale in 2022, and then Alexandra Peaks in 2023 in the same area, all under the PLH model.</p><p>In July 2025, we will be launching another two BTO projects in the area under the new flat classification framework, one next to Alexandra Peaks and another along Tanglin Road. One of the blocks in Alexandra Peaks will also house public rental flats, allowing lower-income households access to public rental options in these prime areas.</p><p>How affordable are Plus and Prime flats? In October last year, Mr Chua Heng Wee and Ms Shermaine Ho, a young couple, applied for a 4-room BTO Plus flat in Merpati Alcove, in Macpherson. They were successful and booked a flat on a high floor early this year, for around $620,000, before grants.</p><p>Merpati Alcove is in a very good location, right at the doorstep of Mattar MRT station and within walking distance to the Circuit Road Food Centre. With a combined income of around $7,800 today, they received an EHG of $20,000 and were able to service their mortgage with low cash outlay.</p><p>For prime flats, let us look at Tanjong Rhu Parc Front in Tanjong Rhu, which we launched last month. It is a very attractive project near the city centre and a short distance from the riverfront. A 4-room BTO Prime flat in that project is around $640,000, before grants.</p><p>A couple with a combined income of $8,500 would receive an EHG of $10,000 and will be able to service their mortgage with a monthly cash outlay of about $180. This is what we mean when we say that we will seek to ensure a wide range of affordable housing options for Singaporeans with different housing budgets.</p><p>Let me now turn to the HDB resale market. Singaporeans have been anxious about resale flat prices. Mr Xie Yao Quan asked how resale flats can be kept affordable for Singaporeans. I mentioned earlier that the supply-demand imbalance had led to high resale prices. In these past few years, we have also seen fewer flats reaching their minimum occupation period (MOP), due to fewer flat completions during the pandemic.</p><p>In fact, in 2020, HDB should have completed 20,000 flats, but because of the disruptions by the pandemic, we completed fewer than half of that. So, five years on in 2025, with much fewer flats completing their MOP and even fewer flats going on the resale market. The supply tightness should start to recover next year. We expect to see a larger supply of flats entering the resale market, providing options for Singaporeans. There will be a significant jump in the number of new flats reaching MOP, from 8,000 this year, to 13,500 next year, and this will steadily increase until we hit 19,500 in 2028.</p><p>The cooling measures that we implemented will also continue to work their way through the market. Taken together, the HDB resale market will stabilise. We will also improve housing accessibility for all Singaporeans. But let me assure first-timer families that we will continue to prioritise you for new flats. First, we tighten the rules on non-selection of flats, to give priority for those with genuine, pressing housing needs.</p><p>Next, we also introduced the First-timer (Parents and Married Couples) (or FT(PMC)) category. We have seen positive outcomes so far. Take Ms Nicole Chong and Mr Christopher Edward Sean. They decided to solemnise their marriage before applying for their flat. This made them eligible for the FT(PMC) category. With that, they managed to book their 4-room Standard flat in Sengkang on their very first try!</p><p>Nicole and Christopher are just one of the many couples who have benefited from these priority schemes. About nine in 10 First-Timer Parents' and Married Couple applicants have so far been invited to book a flat when they applied for a 4-room or smaller Standard flat. This means that virtually all of them were given the chance to book a flat within two tries in categories where they are given first priority. We have also provided more support to families who need a place to stay while waiting to collect their keys.</p><h6>11.45 am</h6><p>Today, we provide subsidised temporary housing through the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS). In recent exercises, all eligible applicants who are married with children aged 18 and below have been invited to select a PPHS flat. We will double PPHS supply again from 2,000 to 4,000 PPHS flats this year. And we have come a long way since 2021, when we started out with 800 PPHS flats. So, some five times increase.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked whether the Government will consider allowing single unwed parents to qualify for PPHS. To all single parents who have needs, HDB will not turn away your request for housing assistance. We will take a holistic approach to every case and, depending on the needs, we may assist with interim rental housing.</p><p>So, for those who are eligible for the schemes that I have mentioned, they likely can book a flat on their first or second try, based on current trends. Then, they can apply for temporary subsidised rental housing through the PPHS. If they booked a SWT flat, they will be able to collect their keys in two-plus years.&nbsp;</p><p>Miss Cheryl Chan asked how we plan to keep housing affordable. Aside from first-timer families, we recognise that there are more singles looking to own their own home. Over the years, we have provided singles with greater access to public housing. In the past, singles 35 and above were only allowed to buy HDB resale flats. Then in 2013, the Government allowed first-timer singles to purchase new 2-room BTO flats, but only in non-mature estates.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, we have made further moves. From October last year, we allowed first-timer singles to apply for 2-room Flexi BTO flats island-wide, including in Prime and Plus locations, and not just Standard. Just last month, one in four of the flats offered at the launch was a 2-room Flexi flat. In fact, we will launch up to 14,000 2-room Flexi BTO flats from 2024 to 2026 and the majority of these will continue to be set aside for singles.&nbsp;From the middle of this year, we will move beyond just access, to providing priority access for singles who wish to live near or with their parents, under the new Family Care Scheme. We also want to look at the needs of other groups, including second-timer families.</p><p>In 2022, we had reduced the proportion of BTO supply set aside for second-timer&nbsp;families in order to better prioritise first-timer families because, if Members remember then, first-timer application rates had increased significantly. Application rates for first-timer families have come down. We also hear the concerns of second-timer families who need to buy another subsidised flat. And these include families which have grown and others who may wish to right-size due to financial reasons.</p><p>Therefore, we will allow more second-timer families to buy BTO flats by increasing the second-timer allocation quota by five percentage points for 3-room and larger flats. This change will take effect from the July 2025 BTO exercise, that is, the next BTO exercise. HDB will release more details closer to the date. We do not expect significant impact on the application rates for first-timer families as we are continuing to build more BTO flats to meet demand.&nbsp;</p><p>We will continue to review our policies to see if there is scope to improve access further for different groups, such as singles and others. Mr Henry Kwek and Miss Cheryl Chan have also asked if we can raise our BTO and Executive Condominium (EC) income ceilings.</p><p>Our BTO income ceiling today still covers about eight in 10 Singaporean households. New flats and housing subsidies are prioritised for those who need them more. For those with incomes up to $16,000, we will be increasing EC supply this year to around 1,500 units, up from around 1,200 units in previous years. Those within and above this income bracket, can also choose from a wide range of resale HDB flats or private residential properties, for which there is no income ceiling.&nbsp;We will continue to keep an eye on income growth and market conditions, and will raise the income ceilings when the time is right.&nbsp;</p><p>Our second priority is to keep public housing inclusive. We will continue to support the housing needs of different segments of Singaporeans.&nbsp;One segment is our lower-income and vulnerable households, who do not have other housing options and family support at this time. We are making significant moves through the Fresh Start Housing Scheme to support public rental tenants on their home ownership journey, as Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had announced during his Budget Statement. My colleague, Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim, will share more details later.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, another group would be our seniors.&nbsp;Under the Age Well SG programme, we are making our environment more senior-friendly. Miss Cheryl Chan, Ms Carrie Tan and Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin had asked about this.&nbsp;</p><p>At the HDB estate level, we will be introducing senior-friendly enhancements for selected HDB estates under the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) and the Silver Upgrading Programme. These include fitness trails to support healthy living, as well as rest points along pathways to boost walkability.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the home, HDB offers subsidised senior-friendly fittings under the Enhancement for Active Seniors programme (EASE). These fittings help to improve the mobility and safety of seniors in their own homes. We expanded the range of subsidised fittings under EASE 2.0 last year, to include fittings like foldable U-grab bars, home fire alarm devices and more. Since EASE and EASE 2.0 were introduced, about 340,000 households have signed up.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond HDB estates, we also plan to help seniors in private residential properties age-in-place. Mr Henry Kwek, Ms Joan Pereira and Ms Denise Phua asked for more details.</p><p>We have expanded the scope of the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) to include senior-friendly enhancements, such as barrier-free ramps and covered drains for more walkways. We also have a new EUP for Silver Estates, so that these benefits can reach selected estates that have benefited from EUP some time ago.&nbsp;</p><p>We will do more to improve the safety and mobility of our seniors living in private homes within their own home. We will introduce a new programme, EASE(Private), as the Prime Minister had announced during Budget. I remember Ms Denise Phua and Ms Ng Ling Ling asking MND last year to consider this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>EASE(Private) will be available to Singaporean Citizen households living in private properties with at least one senior aged 65 years and above, or who are between 60 and 64 years old and require assistance with at least one of the Activities of Daily Living (ADL). More than 70,000 households will be eligible for subsidies to engage contractors to install a basic list of senior-friendly fittings in their homes, such as grab bars. The Government will subsidise 75% of the cost of these fittings, with the subsidies capped at $1,200.&nbsp;</p><p>EASE(Private) is targeted to commence early next year and will be a three-year pilot programme for a start and then, we will have a review. Aside from improvements to the estate and home, we understand that Singaporeans are also concerned about retirement adequacy. Mr Pritam Singh has asked about this. We hear the concerns that those who buy older resale flats might not have saved enough for retirement. But do not worry, we have a system in place today to help home buyers balance between meeting their housing and retirement needs. And a home is also a store of value for retirement.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who buy older resale flats, there are limits placed on the use of the CPF Ordinary Account, as well as the amount of HDB housing loan taken. The money set aside can then be used to help home buyers meet their retirement needs. The generous housing grants received by eligible first-timer home buyers are also refunded into their own CPF account when they sell their flat.</p><p>Today, seniors can unlock the value of their flats to supplement their retirement income through a number of ways.&nbsp;First, seniors can consider renting out their flat or spare bedroom. They can opt to sell part of their lease back to HDB through the Lease Buyback Scheme. Seniors can also choose to right-size to a smaller home. We will do more for seniors who wish to right-size for their retirement.</p><p>Today, the Government provides a Silver Housing Bonus (SHB), of up to $30,000 in cash when seniors right-size to a 3-room or smaller flat. We will make three changes to the SHB, which will take effect from 1 December 2025. First, we will provide an additional $10,000 cash bonus to seniors who right-size to two-room flats or Community Care Apartments. This will bring the maximum bonus quantum from $30,000 currently to $40,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Second, we will extend the scheme to more seniors living in private residential properties, with annual values between $21,000 and $31,000. They will receive a bonus of up to $10,000 if they right-size to a 3-room HDB flat and up to $20,000 if they purchase a 2-room HDB flat or Community Care Apartment.&nbsp;With this enhancement, more than 15,000 more seniors can qualify for the SHB. Altogether, the Silver Housing Bonus scheme will cover more than three in four residential properties.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, we will adjust the cash top-up requirement so that seniors will qualify for the SHB as long as they commit to a net increase of up to $60,000 in their CPF Retirement Account after right-sizing, for their retirement payouts. This amount can come from their CPF housing refunds, which means that seniors may no longer need to make a cash top-up to qualify for the SHB. This will make it easier for seniors to benefit from the Silver Housing Bonus.</p><p>Mr Chairman, our third priority is to rejuvenate our towns. Some Members have asked about the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS). VERS will be one of the ways to enable our towns to be revitalised to refresh the age profile of our public housing stock. When the concept of VERS was first announced back in 2018, we made it clear that VERS will not start until the 2030s, when our first flats are around the 70-year mark. There are no such flats today, nor any within this decade.&nbsp;</p><p>VERS is a complex and long-term undertaking and is one of a number of programmes that we will need to rejuvenate and reimagine our public housing estates. We need to carefully and sensitively stage the programme to reduce disamenities to residents living in newer parts of towns. At the same time, we need to ensure that there are enough homes for those who need to relocate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We will share more details on the mechanics, processes and packages for VERS in due course and seek views from Singaporeans in the process. Meanwhile, we will do a second round of Home Improvement Programme (HIP) upgrading for flats from around the 60- to 70-year mark.&nbsp;</p><p>The HIP is today our flagship programme for tackling common maintenance issues faced in our older estates. Under the HIP essential improvements, like repairs to spalling concrete, are fully funded by the Government. Ms Joan Pereira had asked about this.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, we are working with industry partners and research institutes to develop better ways to address maintenance issues in our old estates. As our homes get older, issues, such as spalling concrete and external wall seepage, can be destructive to residents' daily lives.</p><p>First, we want to make repairs more durable. For example, HDB introduced the corrosion resistant repair (CRR) method last year.&nbsp;CRR helps to reduce the recurrence of spalling concrete.</p><p>Second, we want to improve diagnosis methods, so that we can more accurately pinpoint the root cause of the issue. One example is external wall water seepage. In complex cases, it can be difficult to identify exactly the source of seepage and the extent of repairs needed through visual checks alone.</p><p>HDB has started trialling the use of better scanning technology. Similar to an x-ray machine, it allows us to see beneath the surface, to try to trace the root cause of the seepage. If successful, residents can look forward to faster and more accurate diagnosis and swifter repair works. We will trial this technology starting with some 70 flats. Then, we will see if this technology can be scaled up for widespread use.</p><h6>12.00 pm</h6><p>Third, we will develop early detection technology, such as predictive data analytics. This allows HDB to put in preventative measures and develop more targeted programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>We will push on with research and development (R&amp;D) over the next few years. We plan to invest around $10 million in R&amp;D to build HDB’s capabilities under these three pillars. HDB will progressively launch grant calls to develop ideas. We will also ensure that the technology we develop will be put to good use, by helping out Town Councils and private contractors to strengthen their capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, as we develop and improve our city, we must make our built environment sector more productive and resilient.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about our plans to accelerate sector transformation.&nbsp;To better support developers in their transformation efforts, we will revise the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) regime for those who undertake complex projects. Currently, to ensure timely injection of housing supply, most housing developers are required to commence construction within two years, and complete construction and sell all units within five years. Failing which, the upfront remittable ABSD component will be clawed back.&nbsp;</p><p>We will therefore extend the ABSD remission timeline for housing developers undertaking these projects. This includes projects that:&nbsp;transform our urban environment at a large scale; optimise land through intensification or integration with other developments including major public infrastructure; rejuvenate older estates; or adopt new technologies to achieve higher productivity targets.</p><p>Through this, we want to encourage housing developers and their alliances or firms to undertake projects that will transform our built environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, to encourage early adoption of CORENET X for smaller projects, the Government will extend the qualifying period for the ABSD remission timeline extension for these projects until 31 December 2026. Details will be released in a statement later today.</p><p>We will also introduce the Built Environment Technology and Capability (BETC) Grant to support the sector in long-term building capabilities that extend beyond immediate project investments. We will set aside $100 million over five years. This will be used to enhance enterprise capabilities, adoption of advanced technologies and the building of firms’ manpower capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>My colleague, Minister Indranee Rajah, will share more about our efforts to transform the built environment sector in her speech. Mr Chairman, if you allow, in Mandarin, please.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20250305/vernacular-Desmond Lee MND 5Mar2025-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;This year marks Singapore's 60th year of Independence. For 60 years, the Government has stayed true to its mission of providing homes for our people. This commitment has never changed and will not waver.</p><p>Today, some elderly parents worry whether their children will be able to afford and purchase homes. We want to assure these parents that we have implemented various measures to ensure their children can afford and acquire homes.</p><p>In January this year, we successfully completed all pandemic-delayed HDB projects, delivering over 75,000 HDB units.&nbsp;We have also reduced waiting times for new HDB projects. Last year, the waiting time for new flats was less than four years, similar to pre-pandemic levels.&nbsp;Overall, the application rates for first-timer families for BTO flats are lower than pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>Last year, we increased the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant to ensure low- and middle-income first-time homebuyers can afford HDB flats. These families can receive up to $120,000 in grants when purchasing BTO flats. Last year's data also shows that most first-time homebuyers can use their CPF to pay their monthly instalments, with only minimal cash outlay required and some not needing to use any cash at all.</p><p>Although the situation has stabilised, the Government will continue to launch many HDB flats for Singaporeans to apply for.</p><p>In the next three years, we will launch over 50,000 HDB units. This is equivalent to one Ang Mo Kio town. This means that between 2021 and 2025, we will launch over 100,000 units, exceeding our previous target.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, we will also launch 3,800 HDB units with shorter waiting times of two-plus years. These shorter waiting time flats make up one-fifth of total supply. We will also launch another round of Sale of Balance Flats later this year.</p><p>Many are familiar with the Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme and have received Government subsidies to install elderly-friendly features, like grab bars and ramps, in their homes. We will extend the EASE programme to elderly households living in private properties to make their home environment more accessible and safer.&nbsp;The programme will begin early next year for a period of three years, with details to be announced later.</p><p>We will continue to address common maintenance issues in older HDB flats through the Home Improvement Programme, such as spalling concrete and external wall seepage, while continuing to develop more inspection technologies and repair methods.</p><p>For retired seniors who wish to monetise their flats to supplement their living expenses, we will provide more assistance.&nbsp;We will enhance the Silver Housing Bonus scheme to benefit more seniors.&nbsp;From 1 December 2025, seniors who right-size to 2-room Flexi flats or Community Care Apartments will receive an additional $10,000 bonus. This means the maximum bonus they can receive will increase from the current $30,000 to $40,000.</p><p>Currently, elderly homeowners need to use cash proceeds from their flat sale to top up their CPF Retirement Account to receive the bonus. We will adjust this rule. Homeowners can use the CPF refund from their flat sale to top-up their CPF Retirement Account. This way, seniors may no longer need to use cash to be eligible for the Silver Housing Bonus.</p><p>Additionally, we will expand the scheme. Currently, the Silver Housing Bonus is only available to private property owners with Annual Value below $21,000. We will extend the scheme to private property owners with Annual Value below $31,000, allowing them to benefit as well.</p><p>Let me summarise.&nbsp;</p><p>Our pioneers' foresight laid a strong foundation that allows us to enjoy high-quality living today; our homeownership rate is among the highest globally.&nbsp;We will carry on with this mission.</p><p>This is our promise to Singaporeans: whether it is you, your children or grandchildren, everyone will be able to have a safe haven, living and pursuing their dreams in a warm and harmonious environment.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mr Chairman, let me conclude.&nbsp;At MND, we have had the privilege to work with many talented architects, planners, builders, dedicated colleagues, industry partners, conservationists, NGOs, nature groups, and so on. They have contributed to making Singapore a distinctive global city and an enduring home for Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>Five years ago, we plunged into crisis mode. COVID-19 had long-tail effects, particularly for construction, but we have caught up and we have sought to address as many pain points as possible. We have completed all COVID-19 delayed flats. We are on track to launch more than 130,000 flats over seven years from 2021 to 2027. We have shortened BTO waiting times this year to the pre-COVID-19 norm. BTO application rates are now lower than during pre-COVID-19 levels. We opened up access to singles and will be restoring some of the access for second-timer families. On the HDB resale market, we implemented cooling measures and ramped up the supply of flats, which will stabilise the market over time.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, we have worked to prepare for the longer term. We introduced the New Flat Classification Framework during the pandemic. In doing so, we ensure social mixing in different parts of Singapore now and in the future. We are also planning bigger moves for areas such as Mount Pleasant, Greater Southern Waterfront, Paya Lebar Airbase and Turf City. This will create more space for Singaporeans, for their homes, dreams and aspirations.&nbsp;</p><p>As Singapore grows and develops, we have also been deliberate in ensuring that we conserve nature and protect our heritage. Given our very limited land and resources, this is not an easy feat. It requires thoughtful and disciplined long-term planning, building on the good work of our predecessors to dream bigger for the future, and to dream sustainably.</p><p>And we are not done yet. It is an ongoing journey and Singapore will always be a work in progress. And through it all, we will continue working with Singaporeans as custodians and stakeholders to shape our social compact and achieve our shared vision to create a home where Singaporeans can thrive, where no one is left behind. This is our enduring commitment for an endearing home. [<em>Applause</em>.]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister Indranee Rajah.</p><p><strong>The Second Minister for National Development (Ms Indranee Rajah)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, we have transformed our city and our island in the last 60 years, despite our limited land. This is enabled by our integrated planning framework, which allows agencies to coordinate land use and development needs. Agencies also closely engage citizens and industry, enabling active participation from stakeholders.&nbsp;</p><p>Effective implementation is equally critical. We will need to push the boundaries for productivity, sustainability and resiliency, to keep Singapore a liveable city for many generations to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, I will share how we are working closely with our stakeholders to revitalise our city for the future: first, we will continue to engage Singaporeans on our Draft Master Plan (DMP) 2025, even as we prepare for the mid-year launch of the DMP2025; second, we will transform the built environment sector to strengthen our productivity and sustainability; and third, we will continue to enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of our city.&nbsp;</p><p>The Master Plan is a statutory plan that translates longer-term land use strategies from the Long-Term Plan into detailed plans and policies to guide physical development over the next 10 to 15 years. It is instrumental to shaping our city’s future, by balancing economic, social and environmental considerations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since the DMP2025 public engagement was launched in October 2023, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has engaged over 175,000 people on its key themes, which are: one, shaping a happy, healthy city; two, enabling sustainable growth; three, stewarding nature and heritage, and four, strengthening urban resilience. These engagements have generated greater awareness and appreciation amongst Singaporeans of the complexities and challenges of land use planning in Singapore, which require balancing housing, jobs, green spaces, infrastructure and heritage, all within our limited land and sea space. Given the DMP’s importance, we encourage all Singaporeans to participate in the ongoing engagements.</p><p>We have ambitious plans for coastal protection against the impacts of climate change.&nbsp;These include the “Long Island” currently&nbsp;being studied as part of DMP2025. \"Long Island\" is a good example of how we use imagination and innovation to overcome our land constraints and address multiple challenges with an integrated solution.</p><h6>12.15 pm</h6><p>First, \"Long Island\" will protect against rising sea levels; second, it will mitigate floods for the low-lying East Coast; third, it will increase our water supply resilience with the creation of a new freshwater reservoir; and finally, it provides optionality for growth, through the creation of new spaces for housing, jobs and recreation, for future generations of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>Given its scale and complexity, we need to start our preparations for \"Long Island\" as soon as possible. We have initiated technical studies, including environmental studies, while simultaneously engaging stakeholders and members of the public to gather ideas and suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond infrastructure, we want to create spaces where we can feel connected to one another and the environment. This involves preserving our built heritage so that we have a physical anchor to our past and memories.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Keith Chua has asked how the Government will support heritage businesses. MND and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) have set up a Task Force on Heritage Businesses, Traditional Activities and Cultural Life. Led by Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim and Senior Minister of State for the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and the Ministry of Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling, the task force aims to strengthen support for heritage businesses and traditional activities so that our built heritage areas retain their character and “soul”. The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth or Senior Minister of State Low Yen Ling will share more about this task force at MCCY’s Committee of Supply (COS) debate.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked how public feedback, especially on high-rise developments in built-up residential areas, is incorporated into our plans, such as those at Amber Road. In land-scarce Singapore, we have to optimise our limited land resources to meet a wide range of diverse needs, including housing, transportation and community spaces. This is especially important for work and residential areas nearer to MRT stations, including the Amber Road area near the newly completed Tanjong Katong TEL station, which can allow more residents to enjoy the convenience of living near transport nodes and amenities. The Government will study the feedback raised, such as on density and traffic, and consider mitigating measures where feasible. With careful planning and thoughtful design, we will continue to safeguard a quality living environment for all Singaporeans, while balancing our diverse land use needs.</p><p>Mr Louis Chua asked how the Government can enhance amenities and infrastructure to enhance liveability and inclusiveness in Sengkang. These will be factored into and featured at the upcoming DMP2025 exhibition, which is the culmination of our public engagements, from June 2025 onwards. The DMP2025 exhibition will display our planning vision, strategies and development plans for the next 10 to 15 years and be brought to various locations island-wide. We encourage everyone to visit the DMP2025 exhibition.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I move to our plans to build a strong and dynamic built environment (BE) sector. The last five years were not easy for the BE sector. The sector was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;To help the sector, the Government provided a slew of support, including significant financial assistance through the $1.36 billion Construction Package; legal support for firms unable to meet their contractual obligations due to the pandemic; and support for contractors to bring in foreign workers, as they were faced with manpower shortages when we restarted construction works. This experience has strengthened our resolve to transform the BE sector, which has been so pivotal to Singapore’s development.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan has asked for an update on the progress of the BE Industry Transformation Map (ITM) efforts. We are on track to hit our target of 70% by 2025 for both the adoption of Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD), which enables greater collaboration between stakeholders, and Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA), which shifts construction offsite to safer and more productive settings before onsite assembly.&nbsp;</p><p>With advancements in science and technology, the BE sector is moving from bricks and mortar to smart technology, encompassing AI-assisted tools, automation and digital collaboration across the construction lifecycle, from planning and design, to construction and inspection. CORENET X, a one-stop digital platform that streamlines regulatory approvals, allows architects and engineers to ensure regulatory compliance more easily and focus on innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>In the construction phase, firms are also deploying technological solutions to improve worker safety. For example, Zheng Keng Engineering and Construction has incorporated AI into their onsite safety surveillance system, so site managers can intervene immediately during risky situations.</p><p>BCA has also recently implemented virtual Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) inspections through virtual scans, as an alternative inspection option to conventional, physical site inspections. We are working with agencies to expand these efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of our continued efforts to drive transformation under the BE ITM, the Government will introduce a new Built Environment Technology and Capability (BETC) Grant to further support the development of long-term capabilities of all firms in the sector. BE firms can receive up to 70% funding support to develop enterprise capabilities, technology adoption and manpower capabilities. One hundred million dollars will be set aside over a five-year period for the grant, which will accept applications from 1 April. I strongly encourage firms to approach BCA for more information and to apply.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government will also continue to encourage our local construction industry to adopt productive technologies. MOF has announced the Land Intensification Allowance (LIA) scheme will be extended until the end of 2030, which allows companies investing in Integrated Construction and Prefabrication Hubs (ICPHs), to receive tax allowance on their capital investment. We are reviewing the types of construction facilities supported by the LIA and will share more details when ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, transformation goes beyond technology. At the heart of any successful sector are the people, in this case, the built&nbsp;environment professionals – the architects, engineers, quantity surveyors and more.&nbsp;This is why we have set up the Taskforce for Architectural and Engineering Consultants in September 2024, co-led by myself and Mr Chaly Mah, Chairman of Surbana Jurong Group.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last few months, the task force has been engaging a wide range for stakeholders, including young professionals and firms in the BE sector. We were heartened to learn that young BE professionals gain immense satisfaction from contributing to Singapore’s built environment. They take pride in designing and constructing buildings that improve the lives of future generations – a hospital that cares for the sick, a school that nurtures the next generation, or a landmark that puts Singapore on the world map.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, professionals have also expressed concerns on the sector’s pay, career development opportunities and HR support. We have also heard that some firms put in lowly-priced tender bids at the expense of quality and business sustainability.</p><p>Let me provide an update on the task force’s efforts and preliminary recommendations, in response to Mr Henry Quek and Mr Lim Biow Chuan’s questions. First, the task force is looking at how we can strengthen and support the BE consultancy trade associations and chambers (TACs), such as the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) and the Association of Consulting Engineers Singapore (ACES), to play a greater role in uplifting the sector.</p><p>The TACs are critical if we are to succeed. The task force will study how to help our TACs build up their capabilities, including areas, such as sector branding, catalysing members’ adoption of technology and capability building. We will share more details when ready.</p><p>Second, the task force aims to make the BE sector a career of choice for talented Singaporeans passionate about shaping Singapore’s physical development. We have also heard our youths’ concerns on the sector’s pay and appeal.&nbsp;In response, the task force is working with the firms, TACs, Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and professional boards to enhance internship experiences and review the starting salaries for fresh graduates. Several progressive firms, such as Arup Singapore, Beca, DP Architects and ID Architects, have already put these in place and we encourage more firms to do so.</p><p>To Miss Rachel Ong’s question, our agencies actively facilitate opportunities for our local architects to participate in public sector projects and showcase their capabilities, through design competitions and tenders. Many local architectural firms have put forth innovative design proposals for unique projects of varying scales and types, ranging from landmark developments, such as the Pinnacle@Duxton, new civic and public spaces, like Geylang Serai Cultural Belt, to signature buildings, such as the upcoming NS Square.&nbsp;</p><p>We have also heard in-service professionals requesting&nbsp;more career development opportunities and improved HR support. I am pleased to announce a new collaboration amongst SIA, ACES and the Institute for HR Professionals (IHRP) to roll out HR transformation support to help firms enhance career development support.</p><p>Third, the task force has heard that some firms tended to put in lowly-priced tender bids at the expense of quality and business sustainability. To address this, the Government has been progressively enhancing our tender evaluation approaches to deter fee-diving and strengthen the quality-based procurement criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>The proportion of tenders awarded to low outlier bids has declined significantly from 2017 to 2024, with the majority of public sector tenders awarded to the top-quality bids. However, we can and will do more.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government will further expand our tender evaluation approach to disadvantage low outlier bids for a wider range of public sector projects.&nbsp;We will also review our procurement contracts to ensure a fairer balance of risks between service buyers and BE consultants. Beyond public sector projects, we strongly encourage the private sector service buyers to enhance your procurement practices. This will give the industry greater assurance to compete on quality, offer differentiated value propositions, and invest in human capital, technologies and innovation.</p><p>Fourth, we want our BE consultants to harness the ongoing technological revolution to grow their capabilities, profits and careers. For example, SAA Architects, a Singapore home-grown firm, has been able to speed up its early design processes by leveraging GenAI-powered automation tools. This lets them focus on higher value work, such as analysis and study of their designs.</p><p>Harnessing technologies can also improve BE consultants’ career prospects. When Mr Muhammad Khalil started his career as a draftsman in 2025, manual drawing was still prevalent. [<em>Please refer to the clarification later in the debate.</em>] Over the years, Mr Khalil upskilled to use technologies, such as building information models (BIM) and AI tools, which opened up new career opportunities. Today, Mr Khalil is a Senior Vice President at Boustead Projects, where he partners developers, builders and fellow consultants to leverage digital technologies to deliver building projects more efficiently.</p><p>To guide more firms and BE professionals to embark on their transformation journeys, I am pleased to announce that BCA will put together a one-stop compilation of the programmes and initiatives that support firms to transform their capabilities and upskill their employees. I encourage firms to tap on these resources to accelerate their transformation journeys.</p><p>The task force will continue working on these highlighted areas. Our efforts will also address some of the feedback that businesses have provided to the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong. We welcome further inputs ahead of our finalised recommendations in the second half of 2025.</p><p>As we revitalise and build our city, we must ensure its inclusiveness to different segments of our society. As such, we had convened a Code Review Committee, to review the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment.&nbsp;</p><h6>12.30 pm</h6><p>The Code review seeks to address the current gaps and anticipate the future needs of persons with disabilities (PwDs), the elderly and young families with children.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, enhancements to lactation room standards to better support the needs of breastfeeding mothers have been proposed. The Code Review Committee has recommended to: first, lower the GFA threshold for the provision of lactation rooms; and second, expand the list of mandatory features that lactation rooms are to be equipped with, such as seats and side tables. In addition, we will continue to provide funding support through the Accessibility Fund, to encourage owners of existing older buildings to upgrade their premises with inclusive features.</p><p>We thank the public for your views during our consultation. The Code will be finalised and released in the second quarter of 2025 and the industry will be given sufficient lead time before the Code takes effect.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Ong Hua Han asked whether the Government would consider extending the benefits of HDB’s Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme to PwDs.</p><p>While EASE is designed to meet the needs of seniors, we understand that EASE may also be helpful for other HDB residents with mobility challenges. HDB assesses applications from those who do not meet the eligibility criteria on a case-by-case basis. Social agencies and healthcare professionals may advise PwDs staying in HDB flats to approach HDB for assistance if they are looking for in-home fittings.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and SG Enable also have a suite of existing initiatives to support PwDs to live independently in the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chairman, in conclusion, our future is shaped by the collective efforts of every segment of society.&nbsp;I urge each of you to actively participate in the upcoming Draft Master Plan Exhibition and our other initiatives that will contribute to shaping Singapore’s urban landscape, as part of our continuous efforts to revitalise and enhance our home.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Sim Ann.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Ms Sim Ann)</strong>: Mr Chairman, I thank Members for their cuts.&nbsp;</p><p>I will speak on four areas: first, maintaining affordable cooked food options in the neighbourhood; second, making physical enhancements to our neighbourhoods to take care of the needs of more users;&nbsp;third, improving the delivery of municipal services; and lastly, resolving complex community challenges.</p><p>Let me first update on our efforts to ensure affordable cooked food options in our estates.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chong Kee Hiong and Mr Henry Kwek will be pleased to hear that our Budget Meal initiative has made good progress since it was announced in March 2023.&nbsp;As of January 2025,&nbsp;more than 60% of 397 HDB rental coffeeshops and about 30% of 403 privately-owned HDB coffeeshops now offer budget meals.&nbsp;</p><p>This means budget meals can now be found at many more heartland locations throughout the island. If we were to draw a radius of 400 metres or about five to 10 minutes walking distance around every coffeeshop offering budget meals, more than 80% of HDB flats would be covered.&nbsp;</p><p>Credit goes to the collective efforts of the Community Development Councils, HDB and Enterprise Singapore for achieving this coverage. In particular, the agencies jointly encouraged nine coffeeshop chain operators to come onboard the Community Budget Meal initiative in July 2024.</p><p>All these stalls offering budget meals can be found on the BudgetMealGoWhere portal, a collaboration between HDB and GovTech, that allows users to search for the nearest coffeeshop with budget meal options. Since its launch, the BudgetMealGoWhere portal has been well-received, and has recorded more than 450,000 unique visitors.</p><p>To reach out to more people, including seniors who may not be active online, MND and HDB have publicised the budget meal initiative via mainstream media, including newspapers and radio channels, and will continue to explore ways to raise awareness on the availability of budget meals in HDB estates.</p><p>We will continue with our plans to make budget meals available at even more locations. We are on track to onboard all HDB rental coffee shops to provide budget meals by 2026.&nbsp;Since December 2023, new buyers of privately-owned HDB coffee shops will need to offer budget meals once they have taken over the coffee shop. Eight coffee shops now provide budget meals in line with this requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>From May 2025 onwards, when privately-owned coffeeshops in HDB estates renew their application to use the Outdoor Refreshment Area (ORA), HDB will also require these coffee shops to offer budget meals as one of the conditions for renewal. This will enable more residents to have access to affordable cooked food.&nbsp;</p><p>While ensuring affordable cooked food options for Singaporeans, we do not wish to overburden our local food businesses, particularly stallholders running small or micro-businesses. To this end, we are studying two key moves.&nbsp;First, we are reviewing the Price-Quality Method (PQM) framework to increase the weightage of quality and take into account stall-level charges that prospective coffeeshop operators will impose on stallholders.&nbsp;Second, we are reviewing HDB’s rental renewal policy to deter overly high rental bids for HDB rental shops and coffeeshops, to ensure that stallholders can continue to operate sustainably.&nbsp;Details of these changes will be announced at a later date.</p><p>Next, let me share on how we are enhancing the inclusiveness of our neighbourhoods. Miss Cheryl Chan, Ms Jean See, Ms Joan Pereira, Ms Denise Phua and the Leader of the Opposition, all spoke on this from the perspective of different stakeholder groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Miss Cheryl Chan asked about spaces that allowed for intergenerational exchange, and for people with special needs.</p><p>We actively partner the community in the design and upgrading of our neighbourhood spaces to ensure that they are inclusive to people of all age groups and capabilities.&nbsp;For example, under the Silver Upgrading Progamme (SUP), agencies will engage residents through a community walk, to identify gaps and seek their suggestions for improvement.&nbsp;</p><p>This may include adding senior-friendly mobility enhancements like rest points and barrier-free access ramps along frequented routes, dementia-friendly features to improve wayfinding, as well as wheelchair-friendly therapeutic gardens and three-generational amenities to promote inter-generational interaction.&nbsp;In addition, we also work closely with community partners to ensure that seniors and the vulnerable are well supported if their flat has been chosen for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).&nbsp;Ms Nadia Samdin asked about this.</p><p>For example, for SERS in Ang Mo Kio, every household is assigned a journey manager who proactively reaches out to provide relocation assistance especially to seniors. Seniors are guided throughout the entire SERS process from announcement to key collection and flat return. Where needed, journey managers work with other agencies such as People's Association (PA), Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and MSF.&nbsp;</p><p>Households who would like to continue living close to their neighbours in the designated replacement site can do so by applying for their replacement flats under the Joint Selection Scheme.</p><p>Sir, Ms Jean See asked about the Tripartite Workgroup’s progress in fostering safer and more efficient last-mile deliveries for delivery personnel as well as residents.&nbsp;Over the past year, our Tripartite Workgroup has engaged over 2,000 stakeholders, from delivery personnel to developers. For greater awareness, URA will rove the exhibition on innovative last-mile delivery practices to heartland malls in the next few months.&nbsp;As the Workgroup continues to study more ways to improve last-mile deliveries, we encourage more stakeholders and residents to co-create solutions suited for different locations.</p><p>Ms Joan Pereira raised on behalf of her residents the issue of disamenities in residential sky gardens.&nbsp;HDB will continue to work with the Member, Town Councils and NEA on various efforts to minimise disamenities to residents, while keeping communal spaces open and accessible for all.&nbsp;We urge everyone to be considerate in their use of communal spaces, including sky gardens.</p><p>Ms Denise Phua asked about support for condominium living. Resources on best practices in estate management and support for dispute resolution are available, such as Strata Management Guides issued by BCA, industry-led accreditation schemes for Managing Agents as well as the Strata Titles Boards (STB) which mediate and hear disputes related to strata-titled properties.</p><p>To the query by the Leader of the Opposition, the funds granted to each town by the Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC), depends on three factors.&nbsp;First, the number of HDB flats in the town. Larger towns with more residents will be allocated more resources.&nbsp;Second, the number and value of projects submitted. The CIPC will evaluate projects in the rank order submitted by the Town Councils (TCs) and Citizens’ Consultative Committees (CCCs).&nbsp;Third, whether the submitted projects meet eligibility criteria. For example, projects that are not value for money, or cater only to specific interest groups or commercial entities will be rejected.&nbsp;</p><p>Broadly speaking, larger towns that submit more projects amounting to higher values get more funding. Most projects are approved. Where they are rejected, there are two reasons. [<em>Please refer to the clarification later in the debate.</em>]</p><p>One, they did not meet the eligibility criteria; or two, they were lower-ranked projects from towns which submitted a total project value far exceeding what would have been commensurate with the number of flats in their town. For such projects, TCs and CCCs can resubmit them in subsequent&nbsp;years with higher rank orders.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, we have completed three funding cycles for FY2021, FY2022 and FY2023. For FY2024, we have completed the first stage of <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">in-principle&nbsp;</span>approval. From experience, the final funding for FY2024 may be slightly lower if TCs and CCCs eventually decide, for their own reasons, not to proceed with some of the supported projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the funding approved to date, between FY2021 and FY 2024, the top five towns are Ang Mo Kio, Pasir Ris-Punggol, Jurong-Clementi, West Coast and Sembawang, with funding ranging from $14.2 million to $21.1 million. These are larger towns ranging from 69,000 to 104,000 HDB flats.</p><p>The bottom five towns are Aljunied-Hougang, Marsiling-Yew Tee, East Coast, Holland-Bukit Panjang and Bishan-Toa Payoh with approved funding ranging from $11.0 million to $4.9 million. Most of these are smaller towns, ranging from 39,000 to 53,000 HDB flats. The exception is Aljunied-Hougang, which has 62,000 HDB flats – a mid-sized town with the lowest funding approved across towns.</p><p>I looked into why Aljunied-Hougang has been receiving less CIPC funding than other towns. The reason is that it has consistently submitted fewer projects than the rest.&nbsp;For example in FY2024, each town on average submitted 53 projects. On average, the CIPC approved about 39 projects at about $4 million per town. Aljunied/Hougang submitted the fewest projects: 18 projects for a total of $1.2 million, and CIPC gave in-principle approval to all 18 projects.</p><p>Sengkang submitted the most projects, 248 projects worth $30 million or about half of the more than $60 million funding approved across all towns. Given funding constraints, the CIPC could only support 47 of Sengkang's higher-ranked projects amounting to $4.5 million.</p><p>The CIPC is happy to clarify with any TC or CCC if they have queries on their rejected proposals. In fact, the CIPC has regularly provided explanations to TCs and CCCs that requested such information and will continue to do so.</p><p>Sir, while municipal issues like cleanliness and pest control may seem routine, they significantly impact residents’ daily lives. Let me now share on how Municipal Services Office (MSO) is working with stakeholders to pilot new approaches to these essential services.</p><h6>12.45 pm</h6><p>In February 2022, we started the Integrated Municipal Operations Pilot in Tampines Town. The pilot centralised the delivery of 10 common municipal services under a single operator, where they used to be done by multiple contractors under different Ministries. This includes services, such as cleaning and infrastructure maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the pilot, the active use of operations-technology (ops-tech) solutions, coupled with the cross-skilling of municipal workers, has enabled them to take on more related tasks with a leaner, more productive workforce, while also addressing issues more pre-emptively.&nbsp;We have reaped good results at our first pilot site and have expanded the integrated ops to Pasir Ris-Punggol, to see if we could achieve similar efficiencies over a larger area.</p><p>To address Mr Xie Yao Quan's question, the expanded pilot continued to yield good results. Resident satisfaction increased by 15 percentage points in the first six months of operation in Pasir Ris-Punggol, on the back of more than 30% speedier response and true case resolution, despite three times the area of operations.</p><p>Given the positive results, we are gathering learning points and studying how to refine and expand the model. We have begun proactively engaging industry partners to share our findings and understand what other capabilities can be tapped on. We will share more details when ready.</p><p>Sir, municipal issues are really about people and not just things like roads and buildings. The trickiest municipal issues tend to involve changing human behaviour.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Joan Pereira has asked for stricter measures to deal with hoarding cases.</p><p>These have already been included in amendments to the Community Disputes Resolution Act last year. Where the hoarder has a suspected mental health condition, the pilot Community Relations Unit (CRU) will work with mental health professionals from relevant agencies and community partners to refer such cases for the appropriate mental health assessment and support. If the hoarder refuses assistance or assessment, affected residents can file a claim with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) and apply to CDRT for a Mandatory Treatment Order.</p><p>We know that the underlying motivations and support networks of hoarders and their families vary from case to case. There is no one-size-fits-all solution and enforcement is only one of the several measures. The New Environment Action Team (NEAT) will continue to develop and refine our strategies.</p><p>Chairman, in Mandarin, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20250305/vernacular-Sim Ann MND 5Mar2025-Chinese(mnd).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;The Government will expand the Budget Meal programme to more locations to benefit more people. We are on track to onboard all HDB rental coffeeshops to provide budget meals by 2026.&nbsp;Starting from May this year, HDB will require privately-owned coffeeshops seeking to renew their application to use the outdoor refreshment area, to provide budget meals.&nbsp;</p><p>While ensuring Singaporeans have access to budget meals, we do not want to overburden our local F&amp;B operators, especially stallholders running small businesses. Therefore, we are studying two new initiatives.</p><p>First, we are reviewing the Price Quality Method (PQM) framework to increase the weightage on quality and take into account stall level charges that prospective coffeeshop operators will impose on stallholders.&nbsp;Second, we are reviewing HDB's rental renewal policy to deter overly high rental bids for HDB rental shops and coffeeshops.&nbsp;</p><p>Further details will be announced when ready.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): These initiatives reflect our commitment to partnering with stakeholders, like residents and business owners, in shaping enduring, vibrant communities and ensuring our neighbourhoods remain desirable places to call home.&nbsp;We invite Members of this House to join us in this endeavour and encourage active participation within your constituencies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Tan Kiat How)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, since Independence, the Government has been working hard to ensure Singaporeans enjoy a pleasant and green living environment.&nbsp;We have come far since our Garden City days and are now transforming Singapore into a City in Nature.</p><p>Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin has asked for progress updates.&nbsp;</p><p>We are continuing to expand our green spaces and bring them closer to every resident. First, we have achieved our 2021 target of developing 130 hectares of new parks by 2026. Second, to make green spaces even more accessible for Singaporeans, as of end 2024, we have established 391 kilometres of park connectors. This is equivalent to crossing Singapore's length from East to West almost eight times. We are making good progress towards achieving our target of 500 kilometres of park connectors by 2030.&nbsp;</p><p>National Parks Board (NParks) will continue expanding its network of parks and park connectors. With eight parks and 13 kilometres of park connectors added to our pipeline of green spaces, we target to develop more than 25 new parks and over 50 kilometres of park connectors, which Singaporeans can look forward to over the next five years.&nbsp;</p><p>We are also progressively carrying out concept studies on over 100 hectares of potential park development area in the coming years, with a view to bring more green spaces closer to all Singaporeans. These complement our plans to enhance 13 Southwestern parks, including transforming three of the parks into Destination Parks and the rejuvenation and greening of Orchard Road.&nbsp;We are also expanding our blue spaces. Last year, we announced plans to designate a second marine park at Lazarus South and Kusu Reef.</p><p>To answer Ms Nadia's query, we are working with the nature community, experts and other agencies on detailed site studies, to inform the designation of the second marine park. We will share more details when ready.</p><p>Ms Nadia and Miss Cheryl Chan asked about accessibility and inclusivity of our green and common spaces, and how we can cater spaces for active living.</p><p>We have made a concerted effort to make our green spaces more accessible and inclusive. Our network of green spaces with therapeutic gardens, landscapes and pro-health features enriches our interactions with nature.</p><p>Mdm Auo Siew Kheng and Mdm Tan Sew Leng are residents who visit the therapeutic garden at HortPark. They are both wheelchair dependent in their golden years and Mdm Auo is also living with dementia. At the therapeutic garden, they enjoy hands-on gardening activities amidst nature and explore sensory plants, like pandan, which evokes memories of local culinary delights.&nbsp;</p><p>We now have 17 therapeutic gardens within our parks island-wide, which is more than halfway to our target of having 30 by 2030. So, as we expand our network of parks in the coming years, we will incorporate more therapeutic landscapes and pro-health features where feasible, such as the upcoming Teachers' Estate Park and the park at Spottiswoode.&nbsp;</p><p>We are also ensuring our parks and gardens are accessible for a diverse range of users, including seniors, children with special needs and wheelchair users, so as to facilitate interactions with nature and encourage active living. For example, in East Coast Park, the KPMG Wellness Garden incorporates barrier-free paths and features a wheelchair-friendly trampoline and accessible lookout platforms. For our Nature Parks, Rifle Range Nature Park also features a wheelchair-friendly boardwalk.</p><p>Last year, we reopened Sisters' Islands Marine Park, which offers barrier-free amenities, including a floating boardwalk, which doubles as a coral habitat and research site. Residents can also look forward to a wheelchair-accessible jetty at Pulau Ubin, which will commence work this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Ang Wei Neng, Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap and Mr Dennis Tan asked about the lift provision in our HDB estates and improving accessibility for residents facing mobility challenges.&nbsp;I fully appreciate the points raised by Members and can empathise with the difficulties that mobility challenged residents face.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, around 99% of all HDB blocks were either built with direct lift access or has benefitted from the Lift Upgrading Programme, or LUP. Since January 2023, we have offered LUP to 28 HDB blocks that do not have direct lift access.&nbsp;HDB is constantly studying how to make our blocks more accessible and inclusive. It keeps abreast of technological development and trials potential solutions to determine their feasibility and cost-effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, HDB has explored mechanical solutions, such as chairlifts and stair climbers. However, these were not implemented due to safety concerns. HDB will continue to explore new ways to bring direct lift access to the remaining blocks, such as working with research institutes to better leverage technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As HDB does so, it has put in place measures to support households that face mobility challenges. For example, these households can tap on the Lift access Housing Grant (LHG), which can support successful applicants with up to $30,000 to buy new and resale HDB flats that have direct lift access.&nbsp;This grant is intended to assist households that require direct lift access due to mobility challenges in securing homes that are more accessible and convenient for them.</p><p>I encourage households with pressing accessibility needs to approach HDB for assistance. Members can also direct these households that require such assistance to our HDB colleagues. HDB will seek to understand the circumstances of the household and provide the necessary support.</p><p>In response to Mr Faisal Manap's query on LUP for the three blocks, the current lift configurations were decided in consultation with residents and their representatives. They meet the objective of achieving direct lift access for every resident and were also successfully polled by the residents of the block.</p><p>Ms Nadia Samdin, Ms Ng Ling Ling and Mr Henry Kwek asked about how we can empower more people to be involved in our City in Nature journey.</p><p>We work closely with the community, industry partners and stakeholders to realise our City in Nature vision and we are very grateful for their support. For example, since the Nature Kakis Network was launched in 2023, we have established 23 Chapters islandwide with over 250 Nature Kaki stewards. NParks also works with community members on the OneMillionTrees Movement, which has planted more than 760,000 trees, including forest and mangrove trees, since 2020.&nbsp;We encourage interested residents to step forward and work alongside us in stewarding our City in Nature.&nbsp;</p><p>When we embark on new park projects, we also involve residents in designing features that will cater to their needs and will continue to do so. Interested residents can also be involved in safeguarding biodiversity, such as through the 100k Corals Initiative, which Ms Nadia has also asked about.</p><p>Launched last December, it aims to scale up our coral restoration efforts over the next 10 years and beyond, with focus on the recovery of rarer species, like the Staghorn coral.&nbsp;We have begun working with experts to develop a coral reef restoration plan, which will guide future restoration efforts and plan to involve the wider community in our efforts. We will share more details when ready.&nbsp;</p><p>We are also very encouraged to see residents initiating green efforts to enliven shared spaces, as Ms Carrie Tan has mentioned. Through the Lively Places Fund (LPF), we have supported ground-up efforts, including allotment or community gardens.&nbsp;To make it easier for communities to set up gardens in their estates, we have simplified the LPF application process.&nbsp;</p><p>Going forward, communities will be able to submit proposals for gardening initiatives, including on top of underutilised HDB multi-storey carparks via a centralised application portal. Applications will open every six months and more details will be shared by HDB.</p><p>Besides gardening, LPF supports community-driven projects that transform public spaces into active, vibrant spaces that bring communities together and we welcome such applications via the same portal.&nbsp;</p><h6>1.00 pm</h6><p>The community also plays a key role in safeguarding animal health and welfare. In light of the cases of animal cruelty and neglect we have encountered in the past year, we have been hearing greater calls to review our penalties.</p><p>Mr Henry Kwek asked for an update on our ongoing review of the Animals and Birds Act (ABA).&nbsp;The ABA provides us with the powers to detect, prevent and control the spread of animal diseases and to safeguard animal welfare in Singapore. We are reviewing the regulatory framework for the prevention and control of animal diseases and veterinary health products. This includes measures to stem animal smuggling and ensure the quality of veterinary health products (VHPs).&nbsp;</p><p>We are also reviewing enforcement powers and regulatory levers for animal welfare and management. For example, we are reviewing the licensing regime for regulated pet sector activities and penalties for animal cruelty offences, including the disqualification order.&nbsp;</p><p>NParks has been conducting small-group discussions with the relevant stakeholders and incorporating their inputs. We intend to share more details later this year and will conduct consultations with a broader set of stakeholders to get feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, we launched the Cat Management Framework to enhance the welfare and traceability of cats, which includes the licensing of pet cats.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked about the sterilisation for pet cats.&nbsp;Last month, I gave a more comprehensive update on the progress of the Framework. We are encouraged to see that 97% of pet cats licensed to HDB flats to date have already been sterilised. We have just started implementing the cat management framework, which requires extensive effort on the ground. For now, we will monitor the situation and work closely with our partners to raise awareness on the benefits of sterilisation.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Nadia Samdin, Mr Chong Kee Hiong, Mr Xie Yao Quan and Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about our wildlife management approach, including our pest bird management efforts.&nbsp;To ensure public health and safety, we will continue to work closely with relevant agencies and stakeholders on our science and community-based approach to manage wildlife populations and strengthen awareness on managing human-wildlife encounters. We have stepped up efforts to manage our pest bird populations.&nbsp;</p><p>In an effort to stem the growth of the crow population and reduce the risk to public safety, NParks has since last year progressively taken on the function of removing crow nests in trees within areas managed by Town Councils. To address the bird feeding situation, we partnered Town Councils and agencies last year to deploy more CCTV cameras and enforcement personnel at identified feeding hotspots. Last year, we took action against 258 incidents for feeding pigeons illegally.</p><p>For feeders with mental health needs, NParks works with agencies to understand their motivations, address misconceptions and discourage them from feeding. We will continue to collaborate with Active Ageing Centres to raise awareness among the elderly on the negative impacts of bird feeding. To complement these efforts, we have also ramped up education and outreach on bird feeding and food waste management at food and bin centres, in collaboration with NEA and SFA. Everyone plays a part in keeping our estates clean.</p><p>We also launched a pigeon management pilot last year, which included a customised plan for participating Town Councils and guidelines for direct population control. The preliminary results are encouraging. The number of pigeon-related feedback across the three Town Councils under the pilot – Bishan-Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar – has decreased between July to December 2024.&nbsp;We are evaluating the pilot's outcomes further and plan to expand the initiative to other Town Councils.</p><p>Chairman, please allow me say a few words in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20250305/vernacular-Tan Kiat How MND 5Mar2025-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>We have been working hard to make our green spaces more inclusive. We now have 17 therapeutic gardens in parks across the island, more than halfway towards our target of 30 gardens by 2030.&nbsp;These gardens are thoughtfully designed to&nbsp;cater to a diverse range of users, including seniors, children with special needs and wheelchair users,&nbsp;to facilitate interactions with nature, improve well-being and encourage active living.</p><p>Singaporeans can look forward to more green spaces that incorporate therapeutic landscapes and&nbsp;pro-health features, such as the&nbsp;upcoming gardens in Teachers' Estate Park and park at Spottiswoode.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Sir, please let me conclude. As Singapore continues to develop, we will ensure that all Singaporeans feel fulfilled, included and empowered in their communities and homes.&nbsp;We are heartened to see community stewardship for our estates, animals and nature, and we will keep working closely with our residents as we push forward with our efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, we can nurture a Singapore that is vibrant and inclusive for many generations to come.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister of State Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.</p><p><strong>The Minister of State for National Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)</strong>: Sir, I thank the Members for their questions and suggestions. Over the years, the Government has uplifted families in need through targeted and progressive shifts in our public housing policy. But our work does not stop here. Today, I will share more about how we will strengthen our support for the vulnerable to achieve two objectives: stability and empowerment.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me start with stability.&nbsp;The Public Rental Scheme has been a social safety net for our lower-income and vulnerable households, providing them a stable home as they navigate other life challenges.</p><p>I would like to assure Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin and Mr Xie Yao Quan that we are continuously improving the Public Rental Scheme for our tenants.&nbsp;</p><p>First, to provide timely support. During COVID-19, applications for rental flats surged and waiting times increased to up to 11 months. Since then, HDB has streamlined the flat selection process and reduced waiting times to an average of five months. We are working to reduce waiting times further. As part of our efforts, we will build another close to 5,000 public rental flats by 2030.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Second, to create a conducive living environment for our tenants to regain stability. Some may remember our older rental blocks, with long narrow corridors and units on both sides, and often clustered together. We no longer build rental housing that way. Today, rental blocks are interspersed with sold blocks and built with similar designs as sold blocks.&nbsp;</p><p>Going a step further, we have been building rental flats in the same blocks as sold flats, to encourage social mixing. HDB has completed six such blocks and will complete another 28 in the next five years. To better meet the needs of our tenants, we have also been adjusting rental flat designs, such as building new rental flats with high partitions to provide more privacy for tenants under the Joint Singles Scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, we piloted the Single Room Shared Facilities model to provide single tenants with their own room, while sharing common facilities like toilets and kitchens. Tenants have moved in from August last year and many were pleased to have their own room. We will continue to learn from this pilot and improve the experience for our single tenants.</p><p>Next, let me touch on empowerment. We are committed to supporting all public rental households on their home ownership journey, starting with families with children or ComLink+ families.&nbsp;Many of these families face complex and overlapping challenges, such as balancing employment and childcare responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Take Mdm Christabel Tan, for example, one of our public rental tenants. After her husband's passing, she became the sole breadwinner of the family, raising three young children on her own. She took on a part-time job, so she could still take care of her children when she was not working.</p><p>Mdm Tan has never been a home owner and she hopes to buy her own 3-room flat one day. However, with her limited bandwidth and unstable income, home ownership seemed out of reach and she applied for a rental flat instead. We have taken steps to better support families like Mdm Tan. Since late last year, HDB provides proactive home ownership guidance to ComLink+ families upon their entry to public rental.&nbsp;</p><p>When Mdm Tan recently collected the keys to her rental flat, an HDB officer spoke with her to understand her home ownership aspirations, work out her housing budget with her based on the housing grants and loan she is eligible for and provide tailored advice on her housing options.</p><p>She was very thankful for the personalised guidance from HDB. It gave her clarity that a stable income with CPF contribution is crucial for her to build up her savings and close the $30,000 shortfall to buy a 3-room flat. Mdm Tan has since started a full-time job as a sales executive and is working hard to buy a flat of her own. To her, home ownership is no longer a distant dream, but an attainable goal.</p><p>We will also do more to support families like Mdm Tan who need help to bridge the last mile towards home ownership.&nbsp;Today, the&nbsp;Fresh Start Housing Scheme (Fresh Start) provides holistic support for second-timer public rental families with children to be proud home owners again.</p><p>I would like to inform Ms Mariam Jaafar that 85 families have moved into their flats through support from Fresh Start. Another 28 families have booked their flat and are waiting for their keys.&nbsp;</p><p>We will do more to support more families to realise their home ownership aspirations. As the Prime Minister had announced in his Budget Statement, we will be enhancing Fresh Start to support more ComLink+ families in public rental on their home ownership journey.&nbsp;</p><p>First, we will extend Fresh Start to first-timer ComLink+ families in public rental, to allow them to buy a 2- or 3-room Standard flat on a shorter lease. This will benefit first-timer families, like Mdm Tan, who find it challenging to buy a 99-year lease flat. With this change, she will be able to afford a shorter-lease 3-room Standard flat and achieve her goal of owning a flat sooner.&nbsp;</p><p>Like all other first-timers, they will continue to benefit from the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) of up to $120,000, in lieu of the Fresh Start Housing Grant.&nbsp;First-timer families who are eligible can apply for Fresh Start from April this year. Those emplaced on the scheme can book a flat under Fresh Start from the first sales exercise in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, we will increase the Fresh Start Housing Grant for second-timer ComLink+ families in public rental from $50,000 to $75,000. With this enhancement, eligible families will receive an upfront disbursement of $60,000 into their CPF Ordinary Account before key collection, to help defray immediate costs of buying a home. The remaining $15,000 will be disbursed in equal tranches over five years after key collection to help families manage their mortgage payments.&nbsp;Eligible families can look forward to tapping on the increased grant from the July 2025 sales exercise.</p><p>I recently visited one of our Fresh Start families, Mdm Nureezan and her two young daughters, Azura and Adiera, at their new flat in Marsiling. When Mdm Nureezan was living in a rental flat, people told her that she would never be able to own a home of her own as a divorced, single parent. But she refused to give up. Knowing the importance for her children to have a better living environment, she was determined to buy her own flat.&nbsp;</p><h6>1.15 pm</h6><p>Fresh Start made home ownership possible for Mdm Nureezan. With the Fresh Start Housing Grant, she was able to buy a new 2-room Sales of Balance flat with a 55-year lease, that is fortunately near her workplace and children’s school. She also benefitted from priority allocation under the Tenants’ Priority Scheme. Her family moved into their new flat within a year, with minimal renovations needed.&nbsp;</p><p>I am very happy for Mdm Nureezan. Her journey was not easy, but she persevered and worked hard for her daughters. She told me that her daughters were overjoyed with tears on the day of moving into their new flat and said this to her “Mama, you made our dream come true.”&nbsp;</p><p>Truly, home ownership is a dream for many. Mdm Nureezan’s story has shown that this dream can come true, as long as families stay committed to this path. Like Mdm Nureezan, more than 700 public rental households moved into their new flat last year. We are encouraged by this, and will continue working with our social agencies and community partners to enable more to do the same.</p><p>Home ownership is a journey, not a destination. It comes with many responsibilities and requires careful financial planning. As our tenants take this important step, we will continue to guide and support them every step of the way.&nbsp;</p><p>Chairman, allow me to now speak in Malay.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20250305/vernacular-5 Mar 2025 - MOS Faishal Ibrahim - Reply to MND Cuts (nj).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>Home ownership represents a significant milestone for many people.&nbsp;We are committed to supporting all public rental households to own their homes, starting with families with children, or ComLink+ families.</p><p>Since late last year, HDB has been providing proactive home ownership guidance to ComLink+ families upon their entry to public rental.

To make a lasting impact, we need the support from every member of the society, including all of us here in this House. Together, we can build a stronger, more inclusive community, so that Singapore remains a home that all Singaporeans are proud of.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Before I go to clarifications, Senior Minister of State Sim Ann, you have a clarification to make?</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>: Mr Chairman, please allow me to make a clarification. There was a missing word from my speech earlier, in the section where I dealt with CIPC applications. I should have said: \"Most projects are approved. Where they are rejected, there are generally two reasons\". And the reasons are as what I have stated in the speech.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: We have to finish at the guillotine time of 1.50 pm I see a number of hands, so my first request to all is to keep your clarifications short. And likewise for the responses from the front bench, to also keep it short. Miss Cheryl Chan.</p><p><strong>Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (East Coast)</strong>: Thank you, Chairperson. I have a clarification for Minister Desmond Lee. Beyond the Home Improvement Programme, does the Government have other plans around rejuvenation for Singapore on a broader level?</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>: Just confirm, the Member is asking about HDB or generally? Generally, okay.</p><p>Mr Chairman, I had spoken earlier in my speech about HIP, which is about making improvements within the home, resolving common maintenance issues in the home, and I have also spoken about EASE to make our homes in our HDB estate safer for seniors. That is within the home.</p><p>Around the home there is the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) and this seeks to improve the livability of the estate, the precinct as well as the neighbourhood. But at the higher level we also have the Revitalisation of Heartlands (ROH) programme and this is a programme that roves around different towns and seeks to rejuvenate the town as a whole. It probably may be better characterised as a very significant NRP.&nbsp;NRP is about specific neighbourhoods but revitalising our heartlands, the ROH, allows us to look at the entire estate, the town centre, the neighbourhoods, the precincts, and to make improvements across large parts of the town.</p><p>So, those are with regard to improving the livability and the quality of life in public housing estates.</p><p>Mr Chairman, I had also spoken about how we are making efforts to also improve our private housing estates, particularly for our seniors. We see as we go around the private housing estates, whether it is a group of condominiums or landed estates, there are seniors living there, and sometimes they face challenges too in getting about daily life. And so, the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) has been around for some time, the different tranches to enable us to work with communities to improve the liveability of those private estates&nbsp;– for example, covering drains, improving walkways, improving pocket greens and parks for inter-generational bonding, for instance.</p><p>But we also had a mirror to what in HDB we call the Silver Upgrading Programme. And the Member might have heard about the Silver Upgrading Programme, which is a kind of NRP, but it covers estates which had already gone through upgrading before, through the MUP, for instance; but with many seniors, we come back again and look specifically at what needs to be done to improve the public housing estates for seniors.</p><p>So, the mirror on the private housing estate side is EUP Silver. EUP is across the board, but EUP Silver allows us to zoom in specifically on the needs of the elderly living in the private estates as well.</p><p>So, these are, in sum, a range of programmes that allow us to improve the livability of our estates. And you heard just now Senior Minister of State Sim Ann talk about the Community Improvement Programme Committee (CIPC) that allows us to make year-on-year, smaller scale improvements to improve the quality of life as well.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Pritam Singh.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: Thank you, Chair. And thank you to the MND office holders for responding to the cuts. Just a few clarifications from me. First on Minister Lee's speech, the Minister spoke about a number of new initiatives, new scanning technology for flats which have a persistent facade-related leakages. Minister identified 70 flats. Just some clarity on that pilot, whether it covers a specific cluster or Town Council, or is it more general to some of the more problematic flats, and whether other Town Councils can request for the extension of this technology to persistent facade-related problems for flats in their Town Councils.</p><p>I thank the Minister for responding to the cut on retirement adequacy. The Minister referred to the Silver Housing slew of policies that MND has and how those are going to be improved. I would just seek clarification on the Community Care Apartments. There was an announcement, I believe sometime in late 2023, about the total number of Community Care Apartments that were being earmarked for construction until the end of the decade. Is there a change to that number? I think the number was 30. Is there is any change to that?</p><p>My final clarification for the Minister pertains to a point I made in my Budget debate speech with regard to the number of ultimate dwelling units that were reflected in the HDB Annual Report in the year 2019-2020 and how that number increased in the latest HDB Annual Report. What was the basis of that increase? If the Minister does not have the reply, I can always file a Parliamentary Question for that clarification. He can just let me know whether I need to do that.</p><p>Finally, to Senior Minister of State Sim Ann, thank you for that extensive reply on CIPC. I think it is well appreciated. With Aljunied Hougang Town Council having received little to no CIPC funding from 2011 to 2021, one can understand why this source of funding is important for Town Councils. I appreciate the funding that has been extended after 2021 and I note Senior Minister of State's reply in terms of how MND will look at some of the projects that have been put up. For Aljunied Hougang Town Council, we will put up projects subsequently with a focus on recreational upgrades and upgrades for seniors in our town, because it is a more mature town. So, just to record my appreciation for that reply.</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>: I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his questions. First is on scanning technology. This is a pilot. We have enterprises that are experimenting with ways to better scan the walls and ceilings. Because visual inspection can go so far, but if you are able to look beneath the surface, you might be able to better pinpoint the source of leaks. I am sure the Member would be familiar with it, when you have external wall seepage, you think the water is leaking from this place, but actually there could be micro cracks in other parts of the external surface that caused this water to accumulate and then enter the home.</p><p>And so, this scanning technology is a pilot and we are going to start with 70 flats. They are all over. We are going to select the flats that will allow us to test out the efficacy of this technology. And having pinpointed it, we hope that the repair method will so called nip the problem in the bud at the source, and hopefully the solution becomes a lot more durable, because then you try to target where the problem is. And so, no specific towns per se, but HDB will identify 70 flats for a start to see whether this technology, coupled with the follow-up repair, achieves results.&nbsp;And if it is successful, then we will try to expand it.</p><p>As I said earlier, Mr Chairman, we will look to strengthen capabilities across our Town Councils, as well as our BE sector, our contractors and all who will need to be able to know how to use this technology and to be able to make more durable repairs.</p><h6>1.30 pm</h6><p>The second question is on Community Care Apartments, no change to the earlier target to build 30 Community Care Apartments by 2030.</p><p>The third question, I must apologise to the Leader of Opposition. I might have missed that in the Budget. Maybe I will just invite him to file a Written Question and I will then have a look at the issue.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Chong Kee Hiong.</p><p><strong>Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Chairman, I have two clarifications. The first one for Senior Minister of State Sim Ann. How will MND ensure that the expansion of the Budget Meal Initiative is sustainable for operators and individual stall owners? My second clarification is for Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How, in his speech, he mentioned that MND has exceeded their target of developing 130 hectares of new parks by 2026, and have made good progress in restoring habitats and establishing park connectors. Does NParks intend to review the next bound of these targets?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Sim Ann.</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>: In response to Mr Chong Kee Hiong's question about budget meals, our officers at HDB continue to stay in touch with the operators in our HDB rental coffee shops. We take in feedback from the operators with regards to the implementation of the budget meals. This is one way in which we check that the scheme is sustainable.</p><p>And as I have also shared in the speech, we are going beyond that to review the PQM framework, as well as considering measures to deter overly high bids, because we are mindful about the possible impact on stall holders who may feel squeezed by providing budget meals on the one hand, but they may possibly also face the requirement for high stall rents. I think in putting in place these measures, we can assure stall holders that we do have the sustainability of their livelihoods at heart.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Joan Pereira.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>: Thank you, Chairman. I have two clarifications for Minister. The first is on the&nbsp;—</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: My apologies, I think that Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How wanted to respond to the earlier clarification? Ms Joan Pereira, I will call you on again.</p><p><strong>Mr Tan Kiat How</strong>: Sir, I just wanted to reply to Mr Chong Kee Hiong's second query about the targets. We announced our vision to transform Singapore from a City in a Garden to a City in Nature at COS 2020. That seems quite a long time ago. We were still in the midst of COVID-19 half a decade ago. We shared our aspiration for Singaporeans to co-exist with flora and fauna, and talked about the importance of enhancing greenery across our island in the face of climate change, more extreme weather conditions and also increased urbanisation.</p><p>This was one of the pillars under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. We have put in place a set of longer-term targets, mostly pegged to 2030, to ensure that we keep on track to make our aspirations a reality. And we are very heartened to see that we are making steady and strong progress in meeting many of these targets, even at the halfway point.</p><p>And many of these targets span the four key areas of our City in Nature vision, namely: first, conserving and extending our natural capital; second, intensifying nature in our parks and gardens; third, to restore nature in our urban landscape; and fourth, strengthening connectivity between our green spaces.</p><p>So, we have made good progress over the last few years, notwithstanding many of challenges of COVID-19. We are now, as Mr Chong pointed out, at the midway mark. Looking at the City in Nature targets, it is a timely opportunity for us to review them and we will do so. We will take stock of our progress and more importantly, identify the areas where we can strengthen our efforts, where needed, to make greater strides to meeting our targets. We are doing so not just under our City in Nature targets, but also in context of the broader Green Plan 2030 that involves many agencies and other Ministries.</p><p>So, we are looking at our targets. We will consider the next bound of our targets beyond 2030 and we will chart our approach beyond that.</p><p>I just want to make a final point to say that, ultimately, these are targets, but it is really the spirit of it. It is our commitment to shaping a City in Nature and we must take ambitious steps to weave nature more closely as part of our urban environment, especially as a small and densely populated city-state, with very tight land use constraints.</p><p>This is a major endeavour that the Government cannot undertake alone. We will need the support of the community and as mentioned earlier in my COS speech, I encourage many more Singaporeans, like-minded Singaporeans, enterprises, corporates, community partners, to work together with us on this important effort.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: We still have many clarifications, but we only have 15 minutes left. Ms Joan Pereira, you have the floor.</p><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira</strong>: Thanks again, Chairman. I have got two clarifications for Minister Lee. On the scanning technology that the Leader of Opposition also asked about, that would be piloted in 70 units, can I make a request to have my Henderson Crescent flats be part of the pilot, if it is not already in the list?</p><p>The second clarification, our seniors' needs are becoming more diverse. The Minister has briefly touched on how the Government intends to support our seniors' housing and retirement needs beyond these measures that were shared. Can the Minister elaborate on other efforts by the Government to meet our seniors' evolving housing needs?</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>: To reply to the first question, let HDB identify the flats which would best allow them to test out the technology. We have been doing a lot of the work in Building Research Institute (BRI), which is HDB's research institute. We want to be able to try this out in more realistic settings. But we certainly will bear the Member's offer in mind and look forward to her support if there are any units in her area.</p><p>The other question is about how we can better support seniors' housing and retirement needs, am I right? I have earlier spoken about various upgrading programmes, to make our homes and our neighbourhoods safer and more senior-friendly, so that is one. In terms of housing options, when it comes to HDB housing, seniors have a whole range of monetisation options, as I mentioned earlier in my speech. They can also do Lease Buyback. So, they age in place, make the home safer through EASE and do a Lease Buyback to allow them to gain an additional income stream for retirement.</p><p>They, of course, can right-size, by buying a smaller BTO flat or a 2-room Flexi flat on a shorter lease, and in doing so, get extra support through the enhanced Silver Housing Bonus, which will be enhanced from 1 December of this year.</p><p>There are also, of course, Community Care Apartments that our seniors can look to move to. This is a concept where housing and social and care come together in the estate to allow our seniors to age within the community more effectively. So, these are the things that we have been doing to better support our seniors with a wider range of housing options, through a suite of monetisation options and to better support our seniors, for example, through SHB as they seek to right-size.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: I am giving priority to those who filed more cuts. Mr Henry Kwek.</p><p><strong>Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru)</strong>: Chairman, I would like to ask MND two clarifications for the BE sector. First of all, some consultants are concerned about being held responsible for what you call excessive contractual liabilities arising from projects and project disputes. Can he share how the proposed review of public sector procurement practices could help alleviate that?</p><p>Second is more on the BETC grants, which will go very far to help the sector. Can MND share more about how, specifically, it will help the BE sector, which is essential for MND's construction plans for the future?</p><p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah</strong>: Mr Chairman, before I respond to those clarifications, I just need to make one small correction with regard to my speech, where I had earlier said that the date of when Mr Muhammad Khalil had started his career as a draughtsman in 2025. The correct date should actually be 2005.</p><p>Coming to the clarifications as sought by Mr Henry Kwek. On the first one about the consultants being responsible for contractual liabilities, the task force acknowledges the industry's concerns about the balance of risk between service buyers and the BE consultants, and how being held responsible for excessive liabilities may impact the consultant's business sustainability. And consequently, the attractiveness of the BE careers.</p><p>So, what we are doing in the task force, and what the review will do, is look at ways to better scope consultants' liabilities to be fairer. One area being studied is the use of limitation of liability clauses, which will enable consultants to procure professional indemnity insurance (PII) coverage to manage liabilities that may arise. For service buyers, having their consultants sufficiently insured by PII would give assurance on the consultant's ability to compensate them should there be a need to do so.&nbsp;And at the sectoral level, having sufficient PII coverage will also allow for more efficient risk sharing, thereby strengthening the sustainability of our BE professions.</p><p>With respect to the other question on the details of the BETC grant, the BETC grant supports initiatives in three key areas: first, enterprise; second, technology; and third, manpower.</p><p>So, it supports enhancement of enterprise capabilities, such as in adopting lean construction practices and collaborative contracting. Second, it will support adoption of advanced technologies, including robotics and automation. Third, it supports the building of firms' manpower capabilities, such as in innovative sourcing methods, job redesign and specialised training.</p><p>These examples are not exhaustive. We are open to considering other relevant initiatives that align with the ITM and which would contribute to the sector's overall transformation.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Xie Yao Quan.</p><p><strong>Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong)</strong>: Thank you, Chairman. Two questions. First, on my suggestion for a separate buyer stamp duty regime for the HDB market to give the Government greater policy optionality to cool the resale market quickly when needed, I would just like to ask the Minister if the Ministry would be minded to consider that suggestion, and if not, why not?</p><p>The second question is to Senior Minister of State Tan, and it is about pest birds. I just want to stress again that this can be a huge pain point for us locally, especially when the bird population flares up and we need quick fixes to bring down the bird population. So, really, are there further strategies and measures that the authorities are considering to help the Town Councils to manage this problem? And could he also share further details about the pilot Pigeon Management Framework that he mentioned in his reply?</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>: I thank the Member for his suggestion made during his cut about having a buyer stamp duty as a mechanism to cool the HDB resale market. Principally, firstly, we have to make sure that the property market, whether it is on the HDB side or the private housing side, is in line with economic fundamentals.&nbsp;We need to understand the causes of market movements and then target measures. And the measures are broadly supply side. That means you inject supply to meet demand. You inject supply in order to assure people that there is available units coming on stream. And then, there are demand side measures, for example, tightening on loans, limiting eligibility, which can sometimes be painful as we have seen, and these are demand side measures, and you need to allow them to work through the market.</p><p>On the Member's specific suggestion, we do not discuss cooling measures because of the sensitive nature of market cooling measures. But we certainly will consider all suggestions that both he and other Members may have given.</p><h6>1.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Tan Kiat How</strong>: Sir, I thank the Member for raising this issue. Indeed, for many town councils across the board, managing pest birds is something that they are working on and we see the number of feedback and complaints coming up, rising over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>The Member mentioned pest birds but maybe allow me to just speak about two specific species because there are slightly different techniques and approach that we use for pigeons as well as crows. Basically, there are roughly, broadly, about four pest bird species in Singapore. We have feral pigeons, common and white-minted mynahs and house crows. So, most of the feedback is really around pigeons and crows. This is something that the HDB has been working very closely with Town Councils to manage some of these disamenities and to manage the population issues on the ground.&nbsp;Let me touch on two particular areas that the HDB has been working closely with Town Councils on.&nbsp;[<em>Please refer to \"</em><a href=\"#WSOS262901\" id=\"OS260301\" id=\"OS260301\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Clarification by Senior Minister of State for National Development</em></a><em>\", Official Report, 5 March 2025, Vol 95, Issue 158, Correction By Written Statement section.</em>]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Tan, I hope you can make it short. I am trying to squeeze one more clarification.</p><p><strong>Mr Tan Kiat How</strong>: Okay. Firstly, it is on pigeons. The Member asked about the pilot that we are working on with three Town Councils (TCs). I mentioned earlier Bishan-Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar. The results are encouraging but one of the most important set of takeaways from the pilot it really requires&nbsp;– it is not just the Town Council or HDB – but requires everyone to play our part. It is not just about reducing the population sizes of the pigeons in the estate, but it is really to minimise the food sources which is one important driver for the pigeon population.</p><p>So, the Member asked what they can do or how can they work more closely with different agencies. The first will be making sure that food sources can be minimised.&nbsp;For example, SFA is working with hawker centre operators to retrofit tray return tracks, having protective netting at food establishments where the bird nuisances were reported to minimise the food source availability for such birds.&nbsp;For example, also, working together with NEA to monitor waste disposal activities near bulk bins and for the Town Councils to also take enforcement action against improper refuse disposal.</p><p>So, there are things that we can do; practical, sensible steps that we can do. We are evaluating the results of the pilot and we will see how we can extend it to more Town Councils.</p><p>On the second species of pest bird issues is really around crows, and that is where NParks has leaned in, leaned forward to work closely with Town Councils to minimise the crow issues on the ground. So, there are things that we can do, sensible things we can do.</p><p>For example, as part of the TC-managed tree regime, how can we work together with NParks to expedite the removal of crow nest and to stem the growth of the crow populations and NParks will deploy trained contractors and operators for such operations.</p><p>There are a number of things we can do as well in terms of habitant modification. The Town Councils can work together with NParks to step up pruning of the trees in hotspot to discourage roosting and we can also improve trapping efficacy; for example, through the use of new designs and trapping methods such as mist nets.</p><p>And thirdly, again, similar to the pigeon issue is about food reduction so I look forward to Town Councils working together of NParks to minimise the availability of food sources and to work together with agencies, like NEA and SFA, to improve food and refuse disposal.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: I was going to give Mr Lim Biow Chuan or Mr Louis Ng the last clarification because they all filed three cuts but we have run out of time. I am sorry. So, can I invite Miss Cheryl Chan to, if you like, to withdraw your amendment?</p><p><strong>Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling</strong>: Thank you, Chairman. As with every COS at MND, we always run out of time to ask all the clarifications. But I think people can appreciate the amount of effort and the wide span of topics that MND covers. I thought there is always worth mentioning and sometimes credit has to be given where it is due. For example, it is really not an easy task to be able to recover in terms of the public housing supply during the pandemic till now, because my Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) Members and I have been fully involved during that time and we know how difficult it was for the contractors and also, for the agency to be able to get the supply back on track. So, I have to say kudos to the Ministry, thank you to Minister Desmond Lee and all the office holders, especially the MND family, I think everyone has contributed to this. Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw my cut.</p><p>[(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Mr Saktiandi Supaat.</p><h6>1.51 pm</h6><h6><em>Future of Singapore's Transport System</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".</p><p>This year marks SG60. In the past 60 years, we have developed from Third World to First.&nbsp;Transport has been a critical part of that story. The hot and creaky public buses have been replaced by fully air conditioned ones.&nbsp;We opened our first Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line in 1987&nbsp;and we now have six lines with more than 140 MRT stations.&nbsp;Our airport and seaport are among the best in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I would like to ask the Ministry to share how it will take Singapore's transport system forward in the next phase?</p><p>For MRT, we plan decades ahead of time with new technologies. With potential artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous vehicles coming onstream, how is our transport infrastructure going to be enhanced?</p><p>It was announced mid-last year that up to $900 million will be spent over the next eight years to improve the bus network under the Bus Connectivity Enhancement Programme.&nbsp;Besides more express bus services and bus route adjustments,&nbsp;how else will we reinvent our public bus system?</p><p>We also have the North-South Corridor (NSC) to look forward to. Conceptualised in 2016, the completed NSC will divert vehicular traffic to the underground expressway tunnel, so the ground-level space can be used for wider footpaths, cycling paths, bus priority lanes and more communal and green spaces.&nbsp;Besides COVID-19, what challenges has the NSC construction encountered and are we on course to achieve completion by 2027 to 2029?&nbsp;</p><p>However, it was disappointing to see the announcement by Volocopter in November that a lack of local funding partners has forced them to put the launch of air taxi services in Singapore on hold.&nbsp;Besides ferrying humans by air, how close are we to seeing our goods and food deliveries flown by unmanned drones,&nbsp;like what is already being done in various cities in China?&nbsp;</p><p>What is the next bound for our transport system beyond SG60 and when do we expect to get there?</p><h6><em>Sustaining Rail Reliability</em></h6><p>Mr Chairman, the six-day interruption on the East-West Line (EWL) in late September 2024 brought the issue of rail reliability back into focus. It was an unexpected disruption, especially after several years of steady improvements and minimal incidents since the challenges in 2012.</p><p>A Straits Times forum letter highlighted the importance of balancing rail reliability with costs, emphasising the severe impact of extreme events on commuters. This is a valid concern and we must always strive to minimise disruptions.</p><p>However, it is important to recognise that our rail operators are not neglecting maintenance to cut costs or simply meet performance indicators.&nbsp;Beyond their service obligations, operators bear significant expenses for service recovery, bridging bus services and repairs during major disruptions. The EWL incident, while unfortunate, demonstrated the effectiveness of our response system and the adaptability of commuters who navigated the situation with patience and understanding.</p><p>The Transport Minister has assured us that SMRT has maintained its maintenance spending, even during years without major incidents. While it is natural to question whether more should be spent, we must also consider the financial balance. With the Public Transport Council carefully managing fare adjustments to protect commuters, any additional funding for enhanced maintenance may require increased Government subsidies, a cost ultimately borne by taxpayers.&nbsp;Greater transparency on revenue and cost figures could help foster public understanding of this complex equation.</p><p>The timing of the 2024 disruption during the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) season added another layer of stress for affected students and parents. While such stress is difficult to quantify, it is reassuring that the School Examinations and Assessment Board acted swiftly to accommodate affected students. This reflects the strength of our broader support ecosystem, on top of what Ministry of Transport (MOT) has done, which works alongside transport operators to mitigate the wider impact of service disruptions.</p><p>As we expand our rail network in the coming decade, a key question remains: what proactive measures are we taking to uphold reliability standards and develop a skilled, future-ready workforce to sustain those efforts? Continued collaboration, innovation and learning from past incidents will be essential in building an even more resilient rail system.</p><p>Let us use this incident as an opportunity to refine our strategies and reaffirm our commitment to a reliable and commuter-centric public transport network.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6><em>Enhancing Rail Reliability</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang)</strong>: Chairman, our MRT network is the backbone of our public transport system.&nbsp;With a growing network and more rail assets to operate and maintain, we need to ensure that we have the appropriate measures in place and dedicate sufficient resources to keep our rail network available and reliable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although our MRT system has been reliable in general, performing well above the target of one million train-kilometres between delays, there had been service disruptions, including a severe one on the East West Line last year. Will the Ministry share its insights on how it will enhance rail infrastructure reliability to minimise service disruptions?</p><p>With an expanding rail network, with the Jurong Regional Line and Cross Island Line in the pipeline, what are the steps taken to recruit, train and retain talents for the rail transport workforce?</p><h6><em>Improving Rail Reliability</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Taking the MRT is part of many Singaporeans' everyday life and it is hard to imagine what Singapore was like before the advent of MRT travel. Singapore's first MRT service started in 1987 and was then just a six-kilometre stretch of the North-South Line (NSL) between Yio Chu Kang and Toa Payoh. Fast forward 38 years, our MRT network now spans 250 kilometres, comprising of 143 stations and six lines. Every day, 9,500 engineers, technicians, statisticians, schedulers and station, workers work diligently to keep our Singapore train services running, making our train services one of the most comfortable and reliable in the world.</p><p>As the Executive Secretary (ES) of the National Transport Workers Union (NTWU), I have met personally, the good men and women from our Rail Industry. Unbeknownst to many, no two rail systems are exactly the same and our rail engineers and technicians are passionate solvers who think out of the box dealing with tens of thousands of spare parts and multiple vendors to maintain and repair train systems uniquely Singaporean in terms of age, build, obsolescence and technical parts used.</p><p>As public transport workers, our Rail workers bear their work with purpose and national pride. During the recent MRT service disruptions, our rail teams worked ceaselessly through many late nights and early mornings, in rain and shine, to minimise train disruptions, all the time carrying the heavy weight of duty to our commuters on their shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that our rail assets are ageing, that there will be new replacements of carriages coming in and the pressures rail workers put themselves through to adhere to top of class deliverables, how will the Ministry work with tripartite partners to level up our workforce to strengthen rail reliability? Are there plans by the Ministry to continue to reinvest into technology alongside our rail operators to ensure that our rail workers have more accurate monitoring gauges to pre-empt maintenance requirements.</p><h6><em>Developing Robust Rail System</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas)</strong>: Mr Chairman, an efficient and reliable public transport is vital in moving millions of Singaporeans daily.&nbsp;</p><p>I note from the Transport Minister's recent Parliamentary Question replies that the Land Transport Authority (LTA) was still looking into the root causes of the recent train disruptions. I hope the investigations would address the following areas:&nbsp;</p><p>One, how did the recent train disruptions differ from past occurrences? Were these technical failures, human errors, or external factors influencing the rail system?&nbsp;Two, how did the LTA and our rail operators handle the train disruptions as they unfolded and how can we ensure timely and clear updates to affected commuters?&nbsp;Three, will there be a review of the current training and preparedness protocols for staff in handling major train disruptions? Are there plans to implement more rigorous training and better incident response simulations to better prepare for unexpected situations?</p><p>It is also important that we continue to invest in predictive and preventative maintenance. How does the LTA intend to use technology, including artificial intelligence, to establish a robust schedule for regular maintenance and inspections for our rail systems, to pre-emptively identify and address potential issues?</p><h6>2.00 pm</h6><p>We should also invest in redundancy systems and parallel bus routes that can be activated swiftly during disruptions, so as to allow commuters to continue their journeys with minimal impact.</p><p>While disruptions are an unfortunate reality of any transport system, they can also be catalysts for improvement. By proactively addressing the root causes, we can refine our rail system to ensure a safer, more reliable experience for all Singaporean commuters.</p><h6><em>Train Service in the West</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Residents in Jurong West are currently served only by the East-West Line, and we welcome the upcoming Jurong Region Line, or JRL. While Singapore's train network has significantly improved in reliability and consistently achieving over one million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF), breakdowns cannot be entirely ruled out.</p><p>To enhance resilience in the West, even with JRL, I urge LTA to consider extending the JRL to connect with the Circle Line and the upcoming Cross Island Line as soon as possible. This will not only provide alternative routes during disruptions but also improve connectivity and convenience for residents in the western region.</p><h6><em>New Rail Line in North and Northeast</em></h6><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) 2040 was first released by LTA in 2019.&nbsp;Can the Ministry provide an update on its feasibility studies for a proposed rail line in the north and northeast regions as outlined in the LTMP 2040?</p><h6><em>Growing Public Transport Ridership</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang)</strong>:&nbsp;In 2019, the LTA reported that they were on track to meet its 2030 target of a 75% public transport mode share for all peak period commutes. In 2016, the public transport mode share for MRT, Light Rail Transit (LRT) and buses was 62%. This increased marginally to 65% in 2023.</p><p>I am concerned about the pace of progress in encouraging public transport use, given we are just five years away from 2030. Regardless, however, we should aim to ambitiously exceed our current car lite light targets by enhancing the affordability, comfort and reliability of our public transport network.&nbsp;Commuting via public transport should be made more economical for regular commuters, especially given the high cost of car ownership.</p><p>However, the adult monthly travel pass is still considered expensive by many frequent commuters, many of whom are also being squeezed by the high cost of living. As it is for existing adult monthly travel pass holders, their average expenditure without the pass would be about $140 per month, compared to the price of the pass at $128 per month, just a $12 savings a month, on average, for heavy users of public transport.&nbsp;The average monthly expenditure for adult commuters, on the other hand, is estimated to be only about $45, based on the response to my Parliamentary Question earlier. Even for lower-wage workers who qualify for a monthly concession pass at $96 a month, this is barely economical for average users, without even considering that they already received discounts of up to 25% of adult public transport fares.</p><p>Lowering the cost of the travel pass could better incentivise Singaporeans currently taking less environmentally friendly private vehicle options, regardless of whether it is cars, taxis or private hire vehicles (PHVs), to make the switch to public transport. This is ultimately our goal, as expressed by the LTA, if the plan is to meet and exceed the 75% public transport mode share.</p><p>Therefore, would the Government consider reducing the price of the adult monthly travel pass to further incentivise greater public transport use? Alternatively, could the scheme be expanded to include City Direct and Express fares as well, given an expansion of such travel options as part of the commuting mix and that these two are green public transport options as well.&nbsp;I recognise that building a people-centric public transport network may require funding from the Government's purse, which also includes sustainability-linked revenue sources such as carbon taxes.</p><p>Hence, with carbon taxes aimed at supporting our decarbonisation efforts set to increase in the future, would the additional revenue generated help fund enhancements to our public transport network? As Singapore accelerates towards a car lite future, building a transportation network centred around affordable, comfortable and reliable public transit should be the Transport Ministry's utmost priority.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Gan Thiam Poh, you can take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>New Rail Line</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, many of my residents are appealing to have MRT stations in the proximity of their homes.&nbsp;Will LTA reconsider a new MRT line to support residents at Seletar, Yio Chu Kang, Fernvale at the central, north and northeast zones to the city at the south, and new Woodlands North, as well as to Changi Airport on the east and Tuas on the west?</p><h6><em>Bus Connectivity Enhancement Programme</em></h6><p>With more Built-To-Order (BTO) flats in Fernvale, the demand for bus services has been increasing.&nbsp;Residents need the connectivity to other parts of Singapore and the waiting and commuting times should preferably be minimised as much as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, would LTA introduce new bus services in Fernvale under the Bus Connectivity Enhancement Programme, as well as additional new bus services, once the Buangkok Drive extension is completed, to connect to Buangkok MRT and Yio Chu Kang MRT stations?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Bus Services along Hougang Avenue 7</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, currently, and for many years, there is only one full-day bus service, Bus Service 112 serving Hougang Avenue 7. Would the Government please consider either increasing the frequency of Bus Service 112 throughout the day or add an additional full-day bus service to serve Hougang Avenue 7.</p><p>I have written appeals regarding various different residents' feedback for this bus service over the years, including frequency of services and asking for services to be increased, bus services timing on the LTA's my TransportSG app, at being inaccurate, buses not keeping to scheduling, buses bunching up and so on.</p><p>Residents have also asked for an additional bus service to ply Hougang Avenue 7. Newer residents have moved into Hougang Avenue 7 in the past few years, including the large Riverfront Residences condominium from October 2023 onwards, with 1,472 units, increasing the pre-existing commuter load from residents from the Housing and Development Board (HDB) estate and other condominiums along Hougang Avenue 7.&nbsp;Some residents welcome the new City Direct Service 676 to the Central Business District from 2 January 2025. But there are only two services each during morning and evening peak periods.</p><p>I would like to thank the LTA for agreeing to add additional trips to Bus Service 112 during morning peak hours, from 17 February 2025 onwards, as LTA had informed me in a reply to one of my appeal letters on behalf of my residents. May I seek LTA's confirmation regarding what is the expected waiting time now for the morning peak period?</p><p>Nevertheless, resident commuters I spoke to before and after 17 February still wish for the waiting times for the rest of the day, including the evening peak times, to be reduced, as well as for a second full-day bus service to ply Hougang Avenue 7.&nbsp;I appeal for LTA to look into reducing waiting times at other times of the day, as well as to consider my request for an additional full-day bus service along Hougang Avenue 7.&nbsp;</p><p>I recently appealed, on behalf of a resident, for LTA to consider diverting one of the current bus services currently travelling from Hougang Avenue 8 Punggol Park towards the Hougang Interchange via Upper Serangoon Road. LTA did not agree to this request.</p><p>Sir, there are a number of bus services, such as Bus Services 74, 113, 147 and 324 which pass through Upper Serangoon Road before terminating at Hougang Interchange, three stops later. One of these buses can be diverted to travel via Hougang Avenue 7, Hougang Avenue 5, before heading to Hougang Interchange. LTA has said in a recent reply to my appeal letter on behalf of a resident that diverting could result in longer travel times and higher fares for onboard passengers, as well as affect connectivity for commuters at bus stops along Upper Serangoon Road.</p><p>Respectfully, such a proposal will only add one more additional bus stop to any of the four bus services as compared with the current route along Upper Serangoon Road but will cater to serve a greater number of residents living along Hougang Avenue 7. On the other hand, there are already a number of such services plying Upper Serangoon Road before heading towards Hougang Interchange.&nbsp;I will urge LTA to balance the interest of Hougang Avenue 7 commuters, who have only one such full-day service, as opposed to various existing full-day services along Upper Serangoon Road.</p><p>LTA also suggested in a reply to my appeal letter on behalf of a resident that Hougang Avenue 7 residents are within a 400-metre walk to bus services plying Upper Serangoon Road. Sadly, such a walk may not be expedient for many of our seniors, or those with mobility issues. Moreover, Bus Service 112 is a long loop service between Hougang Interchange, Hougang Avenue 7, Tampines Road, Kovan, Upper Serangoon Road, Hougang Avenues 2, 8, 9 and 10 and Hougang Street 92.</p><p>I took a ride on Bus Service 112 recently in the afternoon, and it took me more than one hour and 10 minutes for the loop. I am not surprised that the nature of this long greater Hougang loop service contribute to the bunching, especially during peak times. A diversion from one of the four above mentioned buses, or better still, a direct feeder bus service alongside Bus Service 112, will provide a more direct access for residents along Hougang Avenue 7.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Public Bus Services at Kaki Bukit</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>: Sir, at the Committee of Supply (COS) 2023, I spoke on behalf of my Kaki Bukit residents, requesting an enhancement of public bus services to improve connectivity to other parts of Bedok Town, particularly the convenience of elderly commuters.&nbsp;The Minister replied that no new routes were being introduced for such intra-town feeder services due to the trade-offs involved.&nbsp;Today, with the same purpose of enhancing the public service for my residents, I would like to request the extension of Bus Service 137 to one of the loops of Bedok South Street 3.</p><p>Sir, the current Bus Service 137 travels to and from Sims Place, the middle and Upper East Coast Terminal. The bus route covers Bedok North Avenue 1, Bedok North Avenue 2, Bedok North Street 3 of Kaki Bukit ward. Unfortunately, the route from Sims Place to Upper East Coast direction does not cover the loop of Bedok North Street 3, which has the bus stop number 84381 and 84391.</p><p>Sir, I have received many requests, especially from elderly residents for Bus Service 137 to be extended to the two bus stops mentioned earlier. Based on my estimation, this extension will only have an added time of between three to four minutes and added distance of about 500 to 600 metres.&nbsp;</p><p>The proposed extension will not only ease the plight of elderly residents who currently have to walk a distance to the nearest bus stop but will also lay the ground for the future residents who will occupy a potential future residential development at the former Bedok Town Secondary School.</p><h6><em>Bus Connectivity Enhancement</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Poh Li San</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, our public bus network serves an essential role in enhancing point-to-point connectivity for commuters who need to or choose to travel on public transport. Encouraging more Singaporeans and residents to use public transport whenever possible is in line with our national effort to go green and reduce our carbon footprint.</p><p>What are the Ministry's plans for enhancement in bus connectivity in 2025, especially for towns with new BTO flats and regional facilities?&nbsp;How will MOT improve accessibility and reduce waiting times for commuters in those areas?&nbsp;Good bus connectivity requires more manpower, from drivers to technicians, to maintain reliability.&nbsp;How will we attract and retain more talent and manpower in this sector?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Autonomous Bus Deployment</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye</strong>: Mr Chairman, earlier this year, LTA launched a tender, seeking proposals to trial autonomous buses and to evaluate the feasibility of using autonomous vehicle technology for public bus services.&nbsp;</p><p>Can the Ministry provide an update on the deployment of autonomous buses for revenue service and the implementation roadmap? How many public transport workers, in particular, our bus captains and bus technicians, will be affected by the roll-out of autonomous buses on our roads? What is the Ministry's plan to ensure that the affected public transport workers are suitably upskilled, reskilled and redeployed? I urge the Ministry to work closely with the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU) to ensure a smooth transition for all affected workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Support for Bus Captains</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, bus captains play a vital role in our public transport system, ensuring safe and smooth journeys for commuters. Their job is demanding. They must navigate traffic while also ensuring passenger safety and comfort. Given these responsibilities, we must ensure that they receive the support they need.</p><p>Beyond that, how can we better recognise and support our bus captains? Strengthening career pathways and professional development can ensure that they feel valued in their roles. A well-supported workforce leads to better quality and service and a positive commuting experience for all. We must continue our efforts to improve the well-being of our bus captains.</p><h6>2.15 pm</h6><h6><em>Improve Public Transport Work Experience</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Yeo Wan Ling</strong>: With over 3.7 million rides a day, Singaporeans are avid bus users and rely on bus services to connect them with the last miles of their daily journeys. As new estates are built and travel patterns evolve, enhanced connectivity and bus service frequency continues to drive the productivity measures of our bus operators. The launch of the $900 million Bus Connectivity Enhancement Programme (BCEP) promises improvements with the introduction of new bus services, the purchase of new buses and the recruitment of more staff.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides new transport infrastructure, investing in our bus captains must be seen as the heart of the matter. It is no mean feat being a bus captain. It requires resilience, patience, multitasking and steely-eyed focus, at all times. The tripartite partnership has convened several taskforces looking into the safety and welfare of our bus captains and ensuring that our bus captain role continues to be attractive to new and younger entrants.&nbsp;</p><p>During the task force meetings, our bus captains gave feedback that protected uninterrupted meal breaks, reasonable runtime lengths, improved technology to enhance safety, refresher programmes and stronger legislative measures against rude, violent acts need to be looked into. Given a growing bus network and higher service expectations demanded of our captains, what more can be done to further improve the working conditions of our bus captains and transport workers?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Update on Public Bus Safety</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, a series of accidents involving public buses last year spurred the establishment of the Bus Safety Tripartite Taskforce in July 2024. June alone saw a public bus run over a construction worker and other buses colliding with cars, a lorry and a trailer truck.</p><p>And it is not just the accidents that we are worried about. A safe bus ride experience is important. The risk of aggressive driving by some bus captains, including rapid acceleration and deceleration as well as swerving between lanes, endangers passengers who are elderly or otherwise less mobile.&nbsp;We must pay attention to how public bus safety has changed amidst increased standing capacity in new bus models over the years, an increasing shortage of bus captains and continued recovery of bus ridership post-COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>Following my Parliamentary Question last November, can the Ministry provide an update on the review of public bus safety by the Bus Safety Tripartite Taskforce? Is it on course to complete its review by the first half of 2025, and have there been any urgent rectification measures implemented as a result of the feedback and studies so far?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Enhance Bus Services</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng</strong>:&nbsp;As our train network expands, it has become the backbone of Singapore’s public transport, with buses primarily serving first- and last-mile connections. However, some bus routes still span over two hours, connecting MRT stations at opposite ends of Singapore. Such long routes are inefficient for commuters and can lead to driver fatigue, raising safety concerns. So, I am glad that Minister of State Murali is leading a taskforce to enhance bus safety and I look forward to his updates.</p><p>Meanwhile, I urge LTA to consider new bus services that connect HDB heartlands more directly to key services like polyclinics. In Nanyang, for example, many residents traveling to Pioneer Polyclinic must walk 170 meters, almost the distance of a bus stop. For the young and healthy, this may be manageable, but for the elderly or sick, even 50 meters can be a struggle. I hope LTA can amend existing routes or introduce new services to better serve these residents.</p><p>Additionally, many bus interchanges, especially open-air ones, appear dated. I urge LTA to upgrade these facilities. Could open-air bus interchanges be converted into air-conditioned interchanges for commuters’ comfort? If not, how can LTA better protect commuters from extreme weather, especially heavy rain and storm?</p><p>Let us work together to make public transport safer, more efficient and more inclusive for all Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Commuters' Experience</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, in rating the quality of public transport, most commuters would consider the following factors, such as safety, affordability, connectivity, reliability, accessibility, frequency, speed and last but not least, comfort.&nbsp;All these factors contribute to our commuters’ experience, which many of us go through almost daily.</p><p>The behaviour of fellow commuters is one of the main contributors to the level of comfort experienced in a journey. Unfortunately, there has been feedback that there are inconsiderate commuters who cause nuisance and disturbances to other commuters. The common complaints include conversing with their friends or on their phones loudly, playing loud music, littering and dirtying seats and stations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>How can the Ministry discourage such inconsiderate behaviour? Would MOT consider introducing fines and other forms of penalties for recalcitrant offenders?</p><h6><em>Noise Nuisance in Public Transport</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong</strong>:&nbsp;Our public transport system should be a calm, reliable mode of travel for all Singaporeans. Yet, many commuters continue to suffer from excessive noise on trains and buses, whether it is someone playing loud videos on speakers or having disruptive phone conversations. While \"Hush Hush Hannah\" has raised awareness, we can still move beyond mascots, reminders and courtesy campaigns to create lasting behavioural change.</p><p>We can have a structured system of personal accountability, backed by clear regulations and effective enforcement. Cities like Shanghai have already implemented bans on loud speakers and videos in their subway system, while France has begun fining passengers were using phone speakers in stations, measures that have shown promising results.</p><p>First, we should establish a definitive decibel threshold, perhaps around 60 to 70 decibels, above which noise is considered disruptive.&nbsp;This level corresponds to normal conversation volume, giving a clear objective benchmark. Public buses and trains could be outfitted with basic sound monitoring devices that automatically alert transport staff when noise levels spike significantly. Alternatively, staff and fare inspectors could use portable meters to verify whether a passenger's device is reaching the threshold. Such technology already exists and its integration will provide evidence-based grounds for issuing warnings or fines.</p><p>Second, we must empower transport staff and station officers with the legal authority and training to enforce these rules. For example, staff could perform regular checks supported by roving inspector teams that respond to commuter reports via a dedicated mobile app or hotline. If a train carriage is especially noisy, a commuter could perhaps tap an in-app report noise button. The station officer at the next stop alerted in real time could board and assess the situation.&nbsp;Upon confirming excessive noise, and the officer could issue an immediate warning or a small fine. A similar reporting mechanism can be implemented for buses.</p><p>Third, the penalty framework must be proportionate, yet impactful. I favour showing leniency to first-time offenders with a warning or a small fine. However, their identification and details can be recorded to ensure tracking for subsequent offences, which can also lead to higher subsequent fines.&nbsp;Clear decibel thresholds, empowered enforcement officers, real-time reporting tools and escalating penalty structure and tools for public awareness will help strike the right balance between personal freedom and communal well-being.</p><h6><em>Public Transport Commuter Experience</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I take the public transport regularly, and there are many occasions when I hear commuters speaking loudly on their mobile phones and I also see young people seated on the floor of the MRT carriage. Sometimes, I also read of bus passengers behaving in an inconsiderate manner by putting up their legs on the bus seats. In January 2025, there was a report of two men who were charged for urinating at MRT stations. This kind of poor behaviour can make our public transport journey less comfortable.</p><p>I notice that there are new stickers on MRT trains that tell commuters to “keep the volume low”, “occupy only one seat” and “no sitting on the floor”. Good reminders. And I appreciate the efforts to remind public transport commuters on the need to be thoughtful and considerate to other commuters.&nbsp;</p><p>However, do these signs have the force of law? Or are they intended to remind commuters on the need to be considerate to other public transport users? If the signs are meant to be enforced, how does LTA determine what level of volume is too loud to be unacceptable and what if a passenger insist on occupying another seat with his bag?</p><h6><em>Improving Commuter Experience for All</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, to fulfil Singapore’s car-lite ambitions, having a world-class public transport system must be a top priority. This means making it accessible to all, including seniors, children, young parents with prams and wheelchair users, just to name a few. A safe and pleasant commuter experience helps position public transport as the mode of choice. As a frequent user of the MRT, this is why I have been asking Parliamentary Questions around this.</p><p>For example, last year, I raised the need to enhance and ensure the consistent display of LCD screens, so that commuters can read the route map and be able to count the stops before their destination at all times.</p><p>To reduce the risk of crowd-related collisions, I also suggested wayfinding floor graphics that are immediately visible upon exiting train cabins, guiding commuters towards elevators on MRT platforms. It is often difficult to locate the nearest lift, especially during peak hours, and on crowded platforms. Even more so when taller commuters obstruct the view of wheelchair users, disrupting their ability to navigate. This complements existing tactile guiding systems, and helps reduce directional ambiguity.</p><p>I had asked about the implementation of gap fillers and ways to further reduce the height difference between the platform and train floor. This too, is in the interest of safety and independent commuting. Can the Ministry share if it has any updates on these suggestions or upcoming plans to further enhance the commuter experience?</p><p>I\tunderstand\tthat\tthe\tMinistry\tperiodically\tcollects&nbsp;&nbsp;feedback&nbsp;&nbsp;through&nbsp;&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;&nbsp;like CrowdTaskSG. A recent example was the study titled, “User Research: Wayfinding on MRT Network” by LTA. Such studies are commendable, as user feedback is the best form of feedback.</p><p>However, can the Ministry clarify how it ensures the collection of a representative sample, as such online channels may end up excluding less digitally-savvy groups, like our seniors. Perhaps the Ministry could consider dedicated outreaches to seniors and persons with disabilities for a broader and more inclusive engagement.</p><p>Lastly, public transport may not be feasible for some persons with disabilities. To facilitate participation in education, employment and even play, can the Ministry elaborate if there are future plans to increase the availability and affordability of wheelchair transport?</p><h6><em>Improving Road Safety for Pedestrians </em></h6><p><strong>Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, road safety is a key priority, especially for our most vulnerable pedestrians, the young, the elderly and those who are physically and visually handicapped. While Singapore has made significant progress in reducing road accidents, we must continue strengthening measures to ensure a safer environment for all.</p><p>I would like to ask the Ministry how we can further enhance pedestrian safety, particularly in high-risk areas. Can we introduce more senior- and handicap-friendly crossings, such as extended green man timings, pedestrian refuge islands and tactile guides? Are there plans to expand traffic calming measures in school zones and estates with high elderly population?</p><p>Technology can also play a role. Can we explore smart traffic signals that adjust based on pedestrian movement or expand automated enforcement to deter speeding in pedestrian-heavy areas?</p><p>Beyond infrastructure, public awareness and enforcement are crucial. How can we further educate road users while strengthening measures against reckless driving?</p><p>Ensuring road safety is a shared responsibility. By improving infrastructure, leveraging on technology and fostering greater awareness, we can create a safer, more inclusive environment for all pedestrians.</p><h6><em>Covered Linkways to MRT Stations</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, in June last year, the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) was launched. Sir, let me express my gratefulness to LTA for the TEL line, as there are three TEL MRT stations within the Mountbatten constituency. The TEL line has facilitated travel for many residents in my constituency.</p><p>However, even though the TEL line has been operational for the last eight months, the covered linkway under the Walk to Ride Scheme, which links residents to the train station are not yet put up.</p><p>So, I urge LTA to plan concurrently so that the covered linkways to the train stations are constructed at the same time with the construction of the MRT line. In that way, once the MRT line is operational, residents can have a sheltered walkway to the train station when they are using the new MRT line. Surely, this is more convenient for all the commuters.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Sheltered Pedestrian Crossing</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I have been requesting sheltered pedestrian crossing for my Kaki Bukit ward, a Silver Zone, in previous MOT COS debates. I would like to continue my request this year, as it is a crucial feature to have, especially for my elderly Kaki Bukit residents.</p><h6>2.30 pm</h6><p>Sir, my ward consists of HDB blocks that were built in the late 70s and early 80s and have a high number of aged residents. There are two neighbourhood centres with each housing a food centre, wet market, shops and supermarket. These two neighbourhood centres, Blocks 537 to 539 and Blocks 509 to 511 precincts of Bedok North Steet 3, are the focal points for my residents for their daily needs, such as grocery shopping and eating their meals. Like any other neighbourhood centres, they also attract many non-residents to come and shop and fulfil their food cravings when many come by their own vehicles or commute by public transport.</p><p>Sir, in the last few years, we have witnessed erratic weather conditions: super heavy rains and strong wind, especially during the monsoon season. For the past few years also, there has also been an increase in PMA users in my ward due to the ageing population. Hence, Sir, I have been persistent in my request to MOT for sheltered pedestrian crossings in my Kaki Bukit ward, linking the 17 blocks and the nearby bus stop to these two neighbourhood centres.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Friendly Street in Private Estates</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, my Jalan Kayu residents at one of our HDB estates, Buangkok Crescent, have been delighted to know that they are one of 10 neighbourhoods in Singapore selected by LTA for the Friendly Streets initiative announced in January this year.&nbsp;As the Member of Parliament for Jalan Kayu, I deeply appreciate LTA’s selection to make the streets there more friendly and safe for pedestrians and cyclists as the estate has one of the highest proportions of seniors above 60 years old in my constituency.</p><p>On the same note, Seletar Hill, one of four Jalan Kayu private estates, also has one of the highest proportion of seniors above 60 years old in my constituency.&nbsp;Given LTA’s intention to extend piloting Friendly Streets to also private estates to ensure safe mobility for seniors living there, can LTA consider: one, Friendly Streets initiative along the main Seletar Road and Jalan Redop, for example, as the gradient of these roads has seen some vehicles speeding through during early mornings, when senior residents come out for morning walks and, in the evenings, when seniors take their after-dinner strolls? Two, when is LTA planning to start consultation with resident networks on the selection and design of the Friendly Streets initiative for private estates?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Safety on Shared Footpaths</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Eric Chua (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore pivots toward active mobility in our last-mile commute, ensuring the safety of shared footpaths, especially for our seniors and young ones, is crucial. The continued occurrence of incidents, such as the fatal collision between a 20-year-old e-scooter rider and an elderly woman in Bedok North last year, has kept the issue of pathway safety on the public’s consciousness.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, LTA mandated that new pathways are to be at least 1.8 metres wide, up from 1.5 metres previously. However, I wonder if this provision is sufficient. In Queenstown, many residents are seniors. Walking from point-to-point is a daily reality for many of them. In Margaret Drive, for instance, owing to an adjacent construction, one particular shared pathway is now a mere 1.62 metres.&nbsp;</p><p>In this instance, I propose widening the shared pathway for the duration of the adjacent construction, by temporarily concretising an adjacent grass strip, measuring 0.45 metres in width. As Singapore society ages, and as we evolve how we complete our last-mile commute, I hope our provisions can spare a thought for the safety of the vulnerable ones in our community.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Personal Mobility Aids (PMAs)</em></h6><p><strong>Ms See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;At the COS debate last year, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the Government had accepted the Active Mobility Advisory Panel’s recommendations on the use of personal mobility aids. Could the Ministry provide an update?</p><h6><em>Implementation of Regulations on PMAs</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Poh Li San</strong>: Chairman, Sir,&nbsp;MOT will be implementing and enforcing new regulations for Personal Mobility Aids (PMAs).&nbsp;With our rapidly ageing population, we will observe greater adoption of these vehicles in our estates.&nbsp;&nbsp;How will MOT ensure that sellers and users are sufficiently informed of the new regulations?&nbsp;What measures does MOT have in place to check on and allow only imported devices that meet the regulatory requirements?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Can the Minister share its public education and communication plans on the new regulations for the general public, especially for the PMA users? What are the enforcement measures on the ground to ensure that PMA users comply with the new regulations?&nbsp;Will MOT be increasing the recruitment of enforcement officers and tap on technology to deter and identify illegal uses of PMAs?</p><h6><em>Safety of Illegally-modified PMAs</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>: Sir, the use of PMDs and e-bikes or power assisted bicycles has become very popular in Singapore. Residents who have weak limbs find these devices very useful in enabling them to move around independently.</p><p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are also many irresponsible riders who illegally modify them and use the PMDs or e-bikes to race on the roads and to ride recklessly. This poses a danger to both the rider and to other road users.&nbsp;Some riders may not even know the highway code but they are allowed to race the PMDs on the roads.</p><p>In mid-February, it was reported that a group of young people were arrested for riding illegally modified or non-compliant PMDs. This is probably the tip of the iceberg as I regularly receive many other complaints about such reckless riders.&nbsp;</p><p>I also received complaints that some of the PMD users would charge their illegally modified PMDs at the HDB void deck and even bring them onto MRT stations. This poses a fire risk to the other residents in the block and to other commuters who may be on the train.</p><p>May I ask MOT how will LTA ensure the safety of residents living in the HDB blocks and the safety of commuters using the trains? Will action be taken against retailers who sell illegally modified PMDs or help to modify the PMAs illegally or if they sell the riders non-compliant batteries? These retailers are also complicit in abetting the commission of an offence and I would urge LTA to take action against them and punish them accordingly.</p><h6><em>Enhancing Safety of Occupational Drivers</em></h6><p><strong>Ms See Jinli Jean</strong>:&nbsp;Occupational drivers, such as those driving heavy vehicles, taxis, private-hire and delivery vehicles, could be motivated by incentives or penalties to drive for long hours without breaks. Thus, employers or platform operators must ensure that such incentive and penalty systems do not increase driver fatigue and compromise vehicular safety. Could the Ministry share how it is working with stakeholders to reinforce shared responsibility for the safety of occupational drivers?</p><h6><em>Safer Worker Transport</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye</strong>: Mr Chairman, co-mingling goods and workers at the back of lorries is dangerous and can result in serious injuries and even fatalities.</p><p>In her recent Parliamentary Question reply, Senior Minister of State Amy Khor highlighted examples of companies already using buses to ferry workers. In fact, I have visited many of these companies, sometimes in the wee hours of the morning, and I commend them for their commitment to safer worker transportation. I urge more companies to do so.</p><p>For specialist tradesmen and small businesses, I urge these companies not to co-mingle people and goods at the back of lorries, as it is dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Can the Ministry mandate the separation of goods and passengers when using lorries to transport workers? Under the Road Traffic Act, all equipment on board lorries must be properly secured to ensure the safety of all road users and workers. I urge LTA and the Traffic Police to step up joint enforcement action against companies which fail to do so.</p><h6><em>Update to Point-to-point (P2P) Industry Review</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Yeo Wan Ling</strong>: The business landscape has evolved for our P2P drivers. The introduction of ride hail services and the use of apps for booking of transport have changed Singaporean commuter behaviours, and we see, indeed, that there is a gradual confluence of taxi and PHV business models. Our drivers have told us it is increasingly difficult for driving to be sustainable, given the escalating costs of business which includes petrol prices, rental fees and maintenance costs. Many of our drivers have taken to driving upwards of 14 hours in a day to make ends meet.&nbsp;</p><p>As we look to rationalising and revitalising our P2P business models – between ride-hail/street-hail, taxi platforms – it is important to note that our drivers have also indicated their growing insecurities with their earnings, welfare and benefits with their platform partners. The lack of transparency when it comes to the distribution of work, price fluctuations and campaigns impact the earnings of our drivers. Some of our drivers say that they find themselves struggling due to hidden costs and unclear earning structures, especially with the introduction of mandatory CPF from platforms.</p><p>Can the Ministry provide an update on the progress of the review of the P2P transport industry structure and regulatory framework? In the review, can the Ministry consider putting in more safeguards to protect the earnings of our drivers, especially since our drivers, unlike the truly self-employed, are subject to the management controls and rules of engagement of their platform partners?&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chairman, in addition, there continues to be demand amongst our seniors, both drivers and commuters, for street-hail services, and there are currently still drivers who are not on any booking apps. The primary reason given is that they find the current user interface of booking apps complicated and they are not digitally savvy enough to navigate these apps effectively. Will the Ministry consider the implementation of a simplified community app for seniors who struggle with technology so that they can gently ease themselves into the more convenient world of ride-hailing?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>P2P Sector</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, I declare my interest as I run a company that leases out taxis, limousines and private hire cars.</p><p>The taxi industry has been a cornerstone of Singapore’s transport, serving commuters faithfully despite PHC disruptions. Taxis remain vital, especially for street-hail customers like tourists and those who are less familiar with phone apps.</p><p>However, PHCs hold significant advantages over taxis. Firstly, about the flexibility: PHCs have no livery and can be used by family members without a PDVL when not in service, allowing for better resource utilisation from a national perspective.&nbsp;Secondly, the resale salue: PHCs can convert to private use, retaining their value, unlike taxis. Their lifespan: a PHC can operate beyond 10 years, while taxis cannot. Last but not least, the regulation: the PHC numbers are unregulated, whereas taxi numbers are capped.&nbsp;Of these, flexibility stands out as the most critical advantage. It allows PHC drivers to maximise the usage of their vehicles, a significant benefit in Singapore, where car ownership is costly.&nbsp;</p><p>To address this imbalance, I propose looking to Montreal in Canada, as an example. In Montreal, taxis are allowed to operate with a large removable taxi top, the taxi top can be removed but without livery, allowing them to function as normal cars when not in service.&nbsp;</p><p>I urge LTA to consider allowing taxis to operate without livery, provided they remain clearly identifiable, that means, you can see it is a taxi very clearly, through a removable taxi top and perhaps an additional LCD sign. This adjustment would create a more level playing field and help sustain the taxi industry.</p><p>In addition, a fast-charging infrastructure is crucial for electric taxis. LTA needs to collaborate with the Energy Market Authority, Singapore Power and other stakeholders to accelerate the fast charger installation. Without this, electric taxis may struggle to support their sustainability goals.</p><p>In conclusion, I urge LTA to level the playing field for taxis. Without intervention, we risk losing a vital service that has long been a pillar of our transport system. Let us work together to preserve the taxi industry for future generations.</p><h6><em>Point-to-point</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong>: Chairman point-to-point (P2P) services play an important role being a convenient and, at times, essential supplement to our public transport system, by providing direct access to specific locations.&nbsp;Our main P2P providers are taxis and private hire vehicles (PHV).</p><p>Although PHVs have been increasing their market share in recent years, taxis continue to have an important role.&nbsp;Their service supply is more stable and they provide street-hail services welcomed by tourists and those who are less tech-savvy, such as the elderly.&nbsp;At locations with high passenger traffic, such as Changi Airport, tourist attractions, shopping malls and hospitals, their availability provides comforting assurance to their users.</p><p>Will the Ministry look into improving passengers’ experiences of all P2P transport services in Singapore?</p><h6><em>Pick-up/Drop-off Points </em>–<em> Private-hire Car Passengers</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Eric Chua (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the point-to-point (P2P) transport sector has evolved significantly in recent years. Commuting in private hire cars (PHCs) has become an integral part of our local transport mix. While many Singaporeans have embraced PHCs as a commute modality, the fact that PHCs are not allowed to pick-up and drop-off passengers at taxi stands runs counter to common sense. Why not allow the use of available infrastructure to facilitate safe pick-up and drop-off for PHC users?&nbsp;From both the convenience and safety standpoints, doing so makes good sense. While I agree with the need to restrict vehicles other than taxis from stopping or parking, I urge LTA and MOT to reconsider allowing PHCs to pick-up and drop-off passengers at taxi stands and stops.</p><h6>2.45 pm</h6><h6><em>Sustainable P2P Transport Services </em></h6><p><strong>Ms See Jinli Jean</strong>:&nbsp;Taxi drivers and private hire vehicle drivers face higher operating costs arising from payments for vehicle leasing, insurances and more. Because the trip earnings of these point-to-point drivers fluctuate depending on the platforms' algorithms, drivers are stressed by financial precarity.&nbsp;</p><p>Platform drivers have asked that platforms disclose what is the average fare per hour or per kilometre. Such information helps them to determine if they can sustain a viable livelihood as a platform driver. This in turn ensures that the Government's moves to uplift platform workers does translate to sustainable point-to-point transport services.</p><p>Drivers have also asked that platforms provide clear and timely communication to drivers if changes to platform policies are likely to impact on drivers' earnings and work schedules.&nbsp;Could the Ministry share its plans to address these concerns?</p><h6><em>P2P Platform Flexibility </em></h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong>: Mr Chairman, point-to-point (PTP) transport like taxi and ride-hail services provide options for direct journeys.&nbsp;It appears that the LTA's PTP sector review is still ongoing, despite being scheduled to conclude by the second quarter of 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The recent market conditions are that driver supply exceeds demand. Therefore, fares and driver earnings have been falling since the start of 2023.&nbsp;It is thus common for drivers to operate using multiple platforms to ensure a steady stream of passengers and boost their earnings – also known as \"multi-homing\".&nbsp;However, this must be balanced against the risk that PTP drivers have insufficient rest.&nbsp;Following the passing of the Platform Workers Act 2024,&nbsp;tying drivers to a single or primary platform may be necessary for effective regulation.</p><p>Having regard to the livelihoods of PTP drivers, how can the Ministry ensure that drivers continue to have the ability to choose the platforms that they wish to drive for?</p><h6><em>Costs of COE </em></h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>: Sir, the rising costs of Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) has been a source of great unhappiness for many young couples aspiring to buy a car. This is especially so when the COE prices kept going up and the COE in the Open category hit a high of $152,000 in November last year. The high COE price has also been blamed for the increased costs of living in Singapore.</p><p>Many Singaporeans feel that the high cost of COE was due to excessive demand from the bidders of PHCs. They feel that many private hire companies buy the cars for hire and then subsequently sell the cars to the hirers for their personal use.&nbsp;</p><p>To be fair, LTA has taken measures to manage COE prices by injecting 20,000 extra COEs over the next few years. Just last month, LTA has also banned private hire cars from being transferred out of the scheme to become passenger cars or transfer them to individuals within three years of its registration.&nbsp;</p><p>The question is whether these new measures will help manage the increasing costs of the COE. May I ask the Minister to provide an update on whether a separate COE category will be created for PHCs? Will LTA introduce any other measures to manage COE costs like imposing the equivalent of additional duty for the buyers of more than two cars. Will the introduction of ERP 2.0 allow the injection of more COEs and help reduce COE prices?</p><h6><em>Alternative COE Durations for Electric Vehicles</em></h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>: The existing vehicle quota system of Vehicle Quota System (VQS) maintains COEs that last for 10 years for the first instance and can be renewed for either five- or 10-year periods thereafter. At the inception of the VQS, the 10-year duration was chosen because it will align with the existing limit of the preferential additional registration fee or part rebate. This duration is somewhat arbitrary.&nbsp;</p><p>Although one could argue that back in 1990, they were also broadly aligned with factors driving vehicle turnover, such as safety, efficiency emissions and maintenance costs. With new electric vehicles (EVs), however, these factors are likely to be dominated by a wholly different consideration. The lifespan of the EV battery. At present, the warranty on EV batteries for most manufacturers is set at eight years, or 160,000 kilometres.</p><p>This is consistent with the practice of designating battery end of life at 70% of the maximum charge. Since the cost of replacing a battery outside of the warranty is prohibitively expensive; estimated at around a third of the cost of the actual vehicle, many would consider this an opportune time to replace the car altogether. We can thus regard eight years as a reasonable lower bound.&nbsp;</p><p>But research suggests that retiring the battery so early, severely under-utilises it and, given the environmental cost of battery manufacture, undermines the EVs sustainability proposition. Indeed, with reasonable use, EV batteries could last somewhere between 15 and 20 years before requiring replacement. Industry experts tend to place the equivalent mileage at closer to at least 300 and 20,000 kilometres&nbsp;– double that of the standard warranty distance. And even if the battery were changed only once at eight years, it would make sense to stretch out the new battery another eight.</p><p>If so, this will afford an equivalent upper bound that amounts to 16 years. There is much uncertainty over the genuine economic and technical lifespan of an EV. In light of this, the existing practice of the Ministry, which disallows the repeated renewal of shorter term COEs, should also be eliminated to preserve the maximum flexibility for EV drivers to extend the use of an environmentally friendly car.</p><p>The claim that returning short-term COEs into the bidding pool preserves equity between existing and prospective owners of cars, has never made much sense to me, since it applies with equal force to longer-term COEs. But insisting on this practice makes even less sense for vehicles that will otherwise endure even longer than the typical internal combustion engine (ICE) equivalents.</p><p>In summary, I propose that the Ministry consider revision in the standard COE duration to 16 years, especially after 2030, when the pure ICE COEs will no longer be issued. For those who desire a shorter term for renewals, much like the present five-year COE, and eight-year duration will also coincide with one battery lifecycle.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Neil Parekh. You may take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Electric Vehicle Adoption Rates </em></h6><p><strong>Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Chairman, Sir, today, there is greater awareness amongst Singaporeans about electrical vehicles. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) has made the availability of EV charging stations as accessible as possible in many parts of Singapore.</p><p>May I ask the Ministry to give this House an update on the adoption rate of electrical vehicles in Singapore and its overall assessment of the pace of adoption and our nation's commitment to sustainable transportation modes.</p><p>Sir, the Government's initiatives have been instrumental in this progress. The EV Early Adoption Incentive offering a 45% rebate on the Additional Registration Fee for fully electric cars and taxis, has been extended until December 2025.&nbsp;Additionally, the Enhanced Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES) provides rebates for vehicles with lower emissions, further incentivising the adoption of cleaner energy vehicles.</p><p>Infrastructure development is also a priority. In this context, Sir, I have two questions for the Minister.&nbsp;First, could the Ministry consider Enhanced Financial Incentives in the form of increase in subsidies or rebates to reduce the initial purchase cost of EVs, making them more accessible to a broader segment of the population. Secondly, in what ways is the Ministry planning to intensify its public education campaign on the environmental and economic benefits of EVs?</p><h6><em>Decarbonising Heavy Vehicles </em></h6><p><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"> </em>The decarbonisation of heavy vehicles is a critical issue which the MOT has been grappling with for quite some time.&nbsp;It is an undeniable fact that heavy vehicles, including trucks, buses and freight carriers contribute significantly to the carbon emissions in our transport sector.</p><p>The MOT must take a proactive stance in implementing measures to decarbonise heavy vehicles, not just for the sake of compliance, but to actively combat climate change.&nbsp;We need a detailed and actionable roadmap.&nbsp;</p><p>May I ask the Ministry to elaborate on its plans to decarbonise heavy vehicles bearing in mind these vehicles have a large carbon footprint? Could MOT also consider incentivising industries to adopt these green technologies by offering subsidies or tax relief, making it cost-effective for businesses to transition?&nbsp;And lastly, what efforts has the Ministry undertaken so far, to engage with stakeholders in the logistics and transportation sectors, ensuring that these policies align with their operational needs?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Order. I propose to take a break now.&nbsp;</p><p>[(proc text) Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order.

Besides the Heavy Vehicle Zero Emissions Scheme and Electric Heavy Vehicle Charger Grant announced by Prime Minister in Budget 2025,&nbsp;we will need to do more. As our EV Road Map sets out, vehicle taxes and incentives should be complemented by regulations and standards, EV charger deployment and industry partnerships.</p><p>To improve charger availability for heavy vehicles, is it possible to explore the possibility of centralised heavy vehicle chargers at centralised parking facilities for heavy vehicles that would complement chargers installed within vehicle owners' premises?</p><h6><em>Electric Vehicles Adoption</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng</strong>: Chairperson, we are pleased to note that one-third of new passenger cars registered in 2024 are EVs, with momentum continuing in 2025. With rising EV adoptions, will there be sufficient EV chargers across Singapore? Beyond LTA's current plan to install chargers at HDB car parks, is LTA prepared to incentivise the private sector to install more chargers, including fast chargers, at commercial buildings and private residential residences?</p><p>In addition, how is EV adoption progressing for commercial vehicles, particularly heavy vehicles? Will LTA introduce more incentives to encourage EV adoption in this sector?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Poh Li San, you may take your three cuts together.</p><h6><em>Decarbonisation for Commercial Vehicles</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Poh Li San</strong>: Mdm Chair, increasingly, vehicles of all types are converting to electric or hybrid sources of energy.&nbsp;However, compared to private vehicles, the adoption of electric and hybrid models for commercial vehicles has been slower, especially the heavier ones used for industrial purposes.</p><p>Reasons include high sunk investment costs, technical and technological constraints, availability and costs of such vehicles, certification requirements and the availability and costs of trained and qualified manpower to operate and maintain newer vehicle models. Vehicle owner awareness and even inertia may play a role too.</p><p>What are the steps that will be taken to incentivise businesses to opt for environmentally friendlier options for commercial vehicles, especially heavy vehicles?&nbsp;Has the Ministry engaged the owners of commercial vehicles about the adoption of greener vehicles and, if so, what are their feedback and main concerns?</p><h6><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Strengthening Air Hub and Cargo Hub&nbsp;</em></h6><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mdm Chair, I declare my interest as an employee in the aviation sector. Last year, Changi Airport registered an increase of almost 15% for passenger movement.&nbsp;I am happy to note that our airport experienced growth from all regions, with North Asia being the fastest growing. How will MOT capitalise on this growth and develop our passenger markets, in particular, the top five: China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and Thailand?&nbsp;What are MOT's plans to maintain Singapore as an air hub in the face of growing competition?</p><p>Our cargo hub also enjoyed exciting growth last year, across exports, imports and transshipments. What are the Ministry's plans to boost our capacity for cargo handling, in terms of our infrastructure, processes, manpower and technology development?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Can the Ministry share its programmes to catalyse the development of our air hub and cargo hub in the next five to 10 years?</p><h6><em>Innovation in Maritime Sector</em></h6><p>Our maritime sector enjoyed\texcellent growth in various categories last year, including the annual vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and total bunker sales. More international shipping groups and maritime-related companies have been set up or expanded their operations here.</p><p>To maintain our lead and market share, even as we are going through the green transition and fending off cybersecurity threats to our maritime operations, we need to continue to innovate and automate.&nbsp;Much of these developments hinge upon attracting and retaining the right talent and workforce development.</p><p>This industry faces manpower challenges due to physically strenuous roles and demanding working environment.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Please round up.</p><p><strong>Ms Poh Li San</strong>: What are the innovations and infrastructure enhancements that are being implemented to help improve efficiency and reduce manpower needs?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Mark Lee, please take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Singapore Connectivity Hub&nbsp;</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mdm Chair,&nbsp;Singapore's position as a key global supply chain hub and connectivity node is critical to our economy, but growing competition from regional ports and airports presents a challenge. To stay ahead, we must continue to enhance our infrastructure, leverage technology, and strengthen our trade and logistics ecosystem.</p><p>How is the Ministry ensuring that Singapore remains the preferred hub for global supply chains, particularly as regional players ramp up their capabilities? What measures are in place to enhance port and airport efficiency, integrate smart logistics solutions and deepen trade connectivity? As businesses seek resilient and cost-effective supply chain solutions, how can we further strengthen partnerships, improve multimodal connectivity and attract more high-value logistics activities to Singapore?</p><h6><em>Global Aviation Hub</em></h6><p>As global aviation becomes increasingly competitive, Singapore must continue to leverage technology to enhance productivity, support workers and maintain our position as a premium aviation hub. With advancements like AI-driven security screening and Terminal 5 on the horizon, how will the Ministry drive wider industry adoption of automation, digitalisation and AI to enhance efficiency and keep costs competitive?</p><p>Beyond infrastructure, how can the Ministry support airlines, logistics providers and aviation services in investing in emerging technologies to stay ahead of regional competition?</p><p>Beyond infrastructure, how will the Ministry support the wider aviation sector, including airlines, logistics providers and support services, in investing in emerging technologies to stay ahead of regional competition? Given that other air hubs are rapidly upgrading, how can Singapore ensure continuous innovation and workforce upskilling to reinforce our status as a global leader in aviation?</p><h6><em>Changi Airport Development Fund</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Mdm Chair, I would like to declare my interest as a member of Civil Aviation Authority board and also as an employee in the aerospace industry. Mdm Chair, developing Singapore into a leading air hub requires more than just expanding airport capacity. To stay ahead of rapidly improving regional airports, we must boost productivity, enhance connectivity and strengthen our position as a key business and travel destination.</p><p>Beyond the airport, the broader air hub ecosystem must also grow in tandem. Critical industries, such as aerospace, maintenance, repair and operations (MRO), logistics supply chain and airside services, need a coordinated strategy that aligns infrastructure expansion, workforce readiness, sustainability, supply chain resilience and industry development.</p><p>Collaboration among key players, Singapore Airlines, Changi Airport Group, Singapore Tourism Board and the hospitality sector, just to name some, must also be deepened to enhance Singapore's Air Hub value proposition. Dubai offers a strong model where its airline, tourism board and airport operator work in synergy to position the city as a premier travel destination.</p><p>As Changi Airport expands, how can we optimise urban planning and resource allocation in areas, such as Loyang Industrial Estate, Changi Business Park, Pasir Ris, Punggol Digital District and Seletar, to reinforce growth and strengthen our aviation sector? What is the Government's long-term roadmap to integrate these elements and ensure Singapore's Air Hub's competitiveness into the future?</p><h6><em>Update on Tuas Port Development</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Yeo Wan Ling</strong>: In an increasingly competitive global landscape, it is critical that Singapore continues to build on its relevancy as an international hub for business and trade. At the heart of the matter, we need to ensure that our workforce is given the opportunity to upskill and that there are clearly articulated career progression pathways for our workers. Can the Ministry provide us with an update on the Tuas Port Developments and how can Singapore prepare our employees for a progressive maritime career, while smoothening the process for professionals making mid-career switches?</p><h6><em>Regional Competition in Maritime Sector</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, the maritime sector has broken new records again in 2024. The annual vessel arrival tonnage in the port of Singapore reached 3.11 billion gross tonnage, while our container throughput from both PSA terminals and Jurong Port crossed 40 million TEU&nbsp;for the first time.</p><p>What are the reasons for the record-breaking performance in 2024 and is it projected to continue upwards? Barely two to six years ago, stagnating container traffic suggested that Singapore may have reached its hub potential as competition from nearby ports, like Tanjung Pelepas grew.&nbsp;</p><p>Our long-time competitor, Port Klang, announced investments to double its capacity in April last year.&nbsp;Emerging ports, such as those in Ho Chi Minh and Hai Phong in Vietnam or Tanjung Priok in Jakarta, are rapidly improving their port infrastructure and capabilities.&nbsp;This has been reflected by the increasing scores of ports in Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia on the United Nations Trade and Development's (UNCTAD's) Port Connectivity Index.</p><p>We cannot afford to sit still. I am heartened to see that we are building on our digitalisation&nbsp;and talent development efforts. But there will also be new challenges as we continue to move all port operations to Tuas by 2027,&nbsp;construct \"Long Island\" and decarbonise our maritime sector.</p><p>So, Mdm Chair, I would like to ask, how is the Ministry ensuring that we continue to remain competitive amidst fierce competition in the region and, at the same time, pull in more workers, or our own Singaporeans, to be attracted to the maritime sector as well?</p><h6><em>Maritime Sector Productivity</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong>: Madam, our maritime sector has been a key growth engine for our economy and provide many jobs and business opportunities.&nbsp;In addition to being an international maritime centre, Singapore is the top bunkering port and busiest container transshipment hub in the world.</p><p>To keep Singapore's lead in this sector, we need to continuously improve the standard and range of services by tapping on new technologies and refine processes to facilitate greater efficiency, consistency and reliability of our maritime services.&nbsp;At the core of all these are our people whose dedication, expertise, skills and hard work have enabled our maritime centre and port to perform outstandingly year after year.</p><p>What are MOT's plans for our maritime workforce's development to elevate their competencies and boost their productivities? How would the Ministry support the adoptions of new technologies to improve existing processes and increase the overall productivity of the maritime sector?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Neil Parekh, you can take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Skills and Expertise for Maritime Sector</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mdm Chair, today, as we reflect on the future of Singapore's maritime sector, one thing is certain.</p><p>The foundation of our success lies in one crucial element: our people.&nbsp;The right skills and expertise are essential to maintaining the competitiveness of our international maritime centre and hub port. The maritime industry is dynamic and fast evolving, demanding a workforce that is not only highly skilled, but also adaptable to new technologies and global trends.</p><p>To ensure that Singapore remains a global leader in maritime excellence, we must prioritise building a robust pipeline of talent. May I ask the Ministry what steps is it taking to ensure that Singapore has a robust pipeline of talent with the right skills and competencies?</p><p>I also request the Ministry to give this House an update on the collaborations with various Institutions of Higher Learning, which offer programmes related to shipping and the maritime sector, and the scale and extent to which it is working with these institutions, to instill the importance of lifelong learning for staff in the maritime sector.</p><h6>3.30 pm</h6><h6><em>Scaling up Bunkering of Alternative Fuel</em></h6><p>As the maritime industry embarks on its sustainability transformation, the safety of alternative fuels remains a critical concern. As a global maritime hub, Singapore is fully committed to leading this transition while ensuring the highest safety standards.&nbsp;</p><p>Can the Minister for Transport to give us an update on the steps Singapore is taking to ensure that the country can scale up the bunkering of alternative fuels safely? What are some of the safety guidelines, protocols and regulations in place and how well-prepared are the staff to ensure that the processes take place safely in the handling, storage and transportation of alternative fuels, such as LNG, biofuels and ammonia?</p><p>Finally, how is Singapore fairing in the research and innovation to develop cutting-edge technologies for fuel safety. Is qualified manpower available to meet the challenges facing the maritime industry in alternative fuels?</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Minister Chee Hong Tat.</p><p><strong>The Minister for Transport (Mr Chee Hong Tat)</strong>: Mdm Chair I thank Members for their questions and suggestions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Over the past 60 years of Singapore's nation-building journey, we worked hard as one people to overcome our challenges and turned them into opportunities.&nbsp;We developed our communications and transport infrastructure and built Singapore as a global transport hub.</p><p>This remains a key growth strategy, one which strengthens our supply-chain resilience, our connections to the world and our geostrategic relevance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We equipped our companies and workers to succeed. Today, our homegrown companies, such as PSA, Changi Airport Group, Singapore Airlines and SATS are global leaders, bringing Singapore to the world and the world to Singapore. Equally important was how we connected Singaporeans to people and places at home through national projects, such as the MRT system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, transportation has played a vital role in our nation's development and will continue to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;At this year's COS, we will build on our strengths to improve the way we live, move, and connect through three areas:&nbsp;first, stronger connectivity; second, safer and more comfortable journeys; third, more opportunities for businesses and workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Let me begin with how we are building stronger connectivity through the land transport network, which serves about 10 million journeys daily. I will start with our rail network.</p><p>&nbsp;Our MRT system opened on 7 November 1987 with five stations – Yio Chu Kang, Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Braddell and Toa Payoh. From these early foundations, the network has grown significantly, with the North-East Line in 2003, Circle Line in 2009, Downtown Line in 2013 and Thomson-East Coast Line in 2020. We will add new stations or lines every year till the end of this decade.</p><p>A few days ago, we opened Hume station on the Downtown&nbsp;Line. By the middle of next year, we will close the loop for the Circle Line, by connecting HarbourFront station to Marina Bay station via three new stations.</p><p>In the second half of 2026, we will open Thomson-East Coast Line Stage 5 and Downtown Line Stage 3 Extension, linking these two MRT lines.</p><p>Between 2027 and 2029, we will open parts of the Jurong Region Line, starting with Choa Chu Kang to Boon Lay and Tawas, followed by Tengah to Pandan Reservoir, and eventually connecting to NTU Campus and Jurong Pier.</p><p>From 2030, we will progressively open our eighth MRT Line, the Cross Island Line, to connect the eastern, western and northeastern regions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Madam, as the Prime Minister said, we are never done building Singapore. Rail projects are major investments. They require careful planning, taking into consideration current and future land-use needs, engineering feasibility and potential environment impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;It also requires political stability, as well as a strong government which can plan long-term, and have the ability and resources to turn these plans into reality, because the plans will span multiple terms of government. In economies that face persistent budget deficits, they would not have the fiscal resources to implement such long-term large-scale projects. With your permission, Madam, may I display a slide on the LED screens?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Go ahead. [<em>A slide was shown to hon Members. Please refer to </em><a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20250305/annex-Annex 1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Annex 1</i></a><em>.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Thank you, Madam. Several Members, such as Mr Ang Wei Neng, Ms Foo Mee Har, Miss Rachel Ong and Mr Leong Mun Wai had previously asked about rail connectivity in the western region. Last year, Senior Minister of State Amy Khor and I provided updates on one of the projects which LTA has been studying – the West Coast Extension (WCE).</p><p>&nbsp;The Government plans to proceed with the WCE in two phases.</p><p>The first phase will extend the Jurong Region Line from Pandan Reservoir station to connect with the Cross Island Line at West Coast station by the late 2030s.</p><p>Under the second phase, our current plan is to further extend the Jurong Region Line from West Coast station to connect with the Circle Line at Kent Ridge station by the early 2040s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;This will enhance rail connectivity for residents in the West, and support future developments along the corridor. It will reduce journey times to the city centre by up to 20 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The WCE will also enhance the overall resilience of our rail network, by providing an alternative via the Cross Island Line, and to the city centre via Circle Line.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Ong Hua Han asked about a new rail line to serve residents in the north and northeast regions. When the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) 2040 was released in 2019, we had shared plans for feasibility studies into a new line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This line, tentatively called the Seletar Line, could serve areas, such as Woodlands, Sembawang, Sengkang West, Serangoon North,&nbsp;Whampoa, Kallang, and the Greater Southern Waterfront.&nbsp;I hope it could also go through some parts of Toa Payoh! [<em>Laughter</em>.] Feasibility studies are currently ongoing.&nbsp;</p><p>We have also identified another corridor for a new rail line, tentatively called the Tengah Line. Similarly, feasibility studies are ongoing to assess if such a line could supplement the transport network in the west and northwest regions, serving areas, such as Tengah, Bukit Batok, Queensway and Bukit Merah.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on LTA's preliminary assessments, these two potential rail lines could meet at the Greater Southern Waterfront. Our feasibility studies will therefore look into the possibility of linking the two lines into a single line, for more seamless connectivity and better efficiency for commuters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If studies confirm that these two new MRT lines are feasible, we expect to complete them in phases from the 2040s. It will benefit more than 400,000 households who will be within a 10-minute walk from this new combined line.&nbsp;</p><p>For our MRT system to remain the backbone of our public transport network, our efforts must go beyond growing the rail network, to ensuring that trains continue to operate safely and reliably for all commuters. This is a challenging task, as our MRT network is an expanding system with many inter-connected elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The rail network relies on the dedication of 7,000 workers and the commitment of tripartite partners to operate smoothly every day.</p><p>Over the past decade, we have invested heavily and made significant strides in rail reliability.</p><p>We set ourselves a high bar – to achieve one million mean kilometres between failure, or MKBF, and have consistently achieved this since 2019. MKBF is a reliability benchmark used by many metros globally, and the one million MKBF benchmark puts us among the top performing metros in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, this is the result of strong tripartite commitment. Since 2020, the Government has supported operators to improve maintenance and operation standards. We have also supported rail sector workers to strengthen their capabilities and improve productivity, through training grants and productivity incentives.</p><p>Maintaining high standards will become more challenging as our network grows. We have one of the densest networks in the world and with more trains covering longer distances, sustaining a high reliability target of one million MKBF will require even greater effort. There is also a need to manage both newer and older systems and assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I thank Mr Saktiandi, Mr Melvin Yong, Ms Poh Li San and Ms Yeo Wan Ling for acknowledging the hard work of our workers and recognising their integral role in maintaining a safe and reliable rail network.</p><p>To further support these efforts, the Government intends to invest up to an additional $1 billion over the next five years to further strengthen our rail capabilities and scale up technology adoption. This will enhance the way we monitor and maintain our assets. The additional funding will also support skills upgrading for our workers to keep pace with these developments.</p><p>This move builds on the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF), where LTA handles asset procurement and replacement, and the operators handle asset maintenance.</p><p>Under this framework, LTA holds our operators accountable for their maintenance of assets. We also have incentives and performance standards in place to ensure that operators deliver good, reliable service. If any operator does not perform, it could face financial penalties and miss out on incentives. This approach has helped us to improve reliability and achieve good outcomes for commuters.&nbsp;</p><p>As more of our rail assets approach the end of their service life, we will need to invest more to improve life cycle management so that we optimise the lifespan of our assets while making replacements in a timely manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The enhanced NRFF will allow us to: expand condition monitoring capabilities for more proactive intervention and targeted maintenance; carry out targeted replacements of sub-systems and&nbsp;components to better sustain the useful life of our assets; and scale up the adoption of new technologies to boost maintenance efficiency and effectiveness across the sector.</p><p>Our operators will continue to be responsible for the maintenance of assets, as per their existing responsibilities under the NRFF.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With the additional investments, LTA can better optimise the life cycle management of rail assets. LTA will determine, based on the condition of each asset, whether maintenance needs to be stepped up by our operators so that the asset can continue to run until the end of its service life, or whether the asset needs to be replaced early, or if it can have its service life extended.&nbsp;This will enable LTA and the operators to achieve high reliability standards while keeping a tight control on maintenance and asset replacement costs, which will benefit commuters and taxpayers.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond technology and hardware, we will also invest in uplifting the maintenance capabilities of our entire rail sector and enable tripartite partners – LTA, operators, and workers – to achieve higher levels of safety, reliability and resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We will strengthen training programmes, provide more opportunities and incentives for workers to upgrade their skills and support rail operators to drive workforce and operations transformation. We will also continue to learn from leading overseas metros and international rail experts to help us stay at the forefront of rail excellence.</p><p>Over time, as workers upgrade their skills through upskilling and reskilling, they will be able to take on higher value jobs, improve their productivity and earn higher wages. This will also help to further uplift standards across the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving to buses, we will continue to improve our public bus network, to provide residents with convenient first- and last-mile access to the rail network, and to amenities in their towns.</p><p>Madam, I launched the Bus Connectivity Enhancement Programme (BCEP) in July last year to better serve new and existing estates across Singapore. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about this.</p><p>So far, we have introduced 10 new services and enhanced 36 services to improve capacity and connectivity for residents in Yishun, Tengah, Hougang, as well as Mr Gan's residents in Fernvale.</p><h6>3.45 pm</h6><p>LTA plans to introduce another 15 more bus services in 2025 across different towns, including Punggol, Bidadari, Yew Tee and Tampines.</p><p>As we deploy more buses, we will also give them priority on more roads to facilitate their movement and improve their reliability. LTA will add about 20 kilometres of new bus lanes this year, and more to follow in the coming years.</p><p>I would like to assure Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Faisal Manap that, as with all bus services, LTA will continue to monitor demand and ridership and introduce new services or enhancements where necessary, including in Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC.</p><p>Madam, we announced some moves last year on taxis and private hire vehicles. Senior Minister of State Amy Khor will provide an update on how we will improve the stability of supply, strengthen contestability and improve passenger experience and access.</p><p>Mdm Chair, the public transport experience goes beyond hardware and infrastructure; we must also pay attention to improving safety and comfort for commuters. Commuters remain at the heart of how we design our transport services. LTA has been progressively enhancing its infrastructure, working closely with Grassroots Advisers and community leaders to better serve our commuters and residents in different towns across Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The design for MRT stations and bus interchanges has evolved and improved over time. For instance, newer train stations and bus interchanges, such as Punggol Coast station on the North-East Line and Buangkok Bus Interchange, are better integrated with residential and commercial developments, making them more accessible and vibrant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Our stations, interchanges, trains and buses have also been equipped with more features to improve accessibility for passengers of diverse needs, such as family-friendly facilities and wheelchair-friendly Passenger Service Centres.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;LTA has developed strong engineering expertise to build our large-scale infrastructure projects. We want to complement this by enhancing LTA’s capabilities to integrate human-centric design with its engineering expertise. Just like how companies like Apple and Dyson are known for combining engineering with design to bring greater value to consumers. We want to learn from such industry leaders and see how we can make key public transport nodes like MRT stations and bus interchanges more user-friendly, more comfortable and more convenient.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;LTA is planning a multi-year effort to review and improve our infrastructure and services, guided by four \"E\"s.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;First, Enhance. We will improve the design of all our transport nodes, to apply what we learnt from building new lines, stations and interchanges to enhance our existing infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Second, Enlarge. We will enlarge the reach and coverage of our commuter infrastructure through features, such as covered linkways, more benches and additional escalators and lifts. This will also make it safer and more convenient for our seniors to age well in the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Third, Enliven. Our transport nodes can host more community activities, offer better retail and F&amp;B services, and serve as venues for promoting the arts, heritage and music to support our local artists and performers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Fourth, Enable. Commuters can make better use of our spaces and services, through improved signages, wayfinding and digital services. And I would like to thank Mr Ong Hua Han for his feedback and suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Madam, we acknowledge that in some of these areas, there is room for improvement. MOT and LTA are committed to making these improvements by learning from best practices, here and abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;As the North-South and East-West Lines have been in operation for over 30 years, I asked LTA to look into a multi-year programme to rejuvenate the stations on these lines. We will study how we can do this through a Station Rejuvenation Programme for the North-South and East-West lines. We will review the upgrades required for each station, tailored to the station’s ridership, footprint, typology and surrounding developments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Yishun station, one of our older MRT stations in Singapore, which is expected to become even busier with surrounding developments, will be the pilot project for this programme. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng will provide more details.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;This Station Rejuvenation Programme will refresh our stations, making them more welcoming and user-friendly while preserving key heritage elements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Similarly, our bus interchanges have also grown into familiar community hubs for residents. We will open new bus interchanges to provide more convenient transfers and refresh existing ones to improve commuter experience and comfort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In the coming months, we will open three integrated air-conditioned interchanges at Woodleigh, Pasir Ris and Punggol Coast. LTA will also upgrade older bus interchanges. Works have already started at Toa Payoh bus interchange, Singapore’s first integrated transport hub.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In response to Mr Ang Wei Neng, commuters at Bishan, Bukit Merah, Eunos and Tampines bus interchanges can look forward to upgrades with new rain screens, additional benches and fans to improve their comfort and commuting experience.&nbsp;</p><p>We also welcome suggestions and ideas from commuters. I am glad that Members agree with the Government’s vision to build a car-lite society, where Walk-Cycle-Ride are the main modes of transport. LTA will set aside an experimentation fund to support ideas from commuters and work with them to jointly develop cost-effective solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>While the vast majority of commuters are considerate and gracious, we need to protect the quality of their commute from the small minority of black sheep whose anti-social behaviours and actions cause discomfort and, sometimes, even endanger others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We will continue with our public education efforts, but we know education alone will not be enough and needs to go together with effective enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I have asked LTA and the operators to step up their Enforcement – which is the fifth \"E\" – by strengthening our regulatory powers and increasing the penalties to deter egregious commuters, especially repeat offenders and those who refuse to cooperate when they are advised by public transport workers. I thank Members from both sides of the House, including Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Dennis Tan, for expressing their support for strengthening enforcement against such behaviours.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Another key aspect of commuter experience is safety.</p><p>In July last year, we launched the Bus Safety Tripartite Taskforce. Minister of State Murali Pillai and our tripartite partners sought views from thousands of commuters, bus captains and both local and international safety experts, who shared their ideas to improve safety practices for the public bus sector.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The task force has submitted its recommendations, which I have accepted.&nbsp;These include how we can equip buses with more safety features, facilitate their smooth travel on the road, and better support Bus Captains to provide safe journeys for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Making roads safer for everyone also means that more pedestrians and cyclists can benefit from active mobility through Friendly Streets and Road Repurposing Projects. Senior Minister of State Amy Khor will elaborate on this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;While we need to be inclusive to those with genuine mobility needs, we must also ensure the safety of other path users. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng will give an update on the implementation timelines for the changes to the safety rules for Personal Mobility Aids that were announced last year. Madam, in Mandarin, please.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20250305/vernacular-Chee Hong Tat MOT 5Mar2025-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>Chairman, we will implement the West Coast Extension Line in two phases: phase one will extend the Jurong Region Line to interchange with the Cross-Island Line at West Coast station while phase two will extend the Jurong Region Line to interchange with the Circle Line. Upon completion, the West Coast extension will reduce commuting time for residents in the West to the city centre.</p><p>Additionally, we are exploring the construction of two new MRT lines. The first is tentatively named as the Seletar Line. It will connect the north and northeast regions to the Greater Southern Waterfront. The other new MRT line is tentatively named as the Tengah Line, will connect the north and northwest regions to the Greater Southern Waterfront.</p><p>If these two MRT lines are feasible, they can be joined to form a longer MRT line – the Seletar-Tengah Line, running from the North to the West through the city centre. If feasible, we expect that these lines to be completed in phases from the 2040s, benefitting more than 400,000 households.</p><p>Our bus services complement the MRT network in improving the residents' commuting convenience.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, we invested close to an additional $1 billion on&nbsp;the Bus Connectivity Enhancement Programme (BCEP).&nbsp;To date, we have launched 10 new bus routes and enhanced 36 existing bus routes. In this coming year, we plan to introduce around 15 new services across Punggol, Bidadari, Yew Tee and Tampines and other such areas to benefit more residents.</p><p>We will continue to improve the designs of MRT stations and bus interchanges. This year, we plan to rejuvenate the stations on North-South line and East-West line.</p><p>Furthermore, we are pushing forward with upgrading of bus interchanges. In the coming months, we will open three integrated air-conditioned interchanges at Woodleigh, Pasir Ris, and Punggol Coast. LTA also plans to upgrade several bus interchanges which have been in operation for some time, including Toa Payoh and Bishan bus interchanges.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Madam, let me turn to my final topic of how we are providing more opportunities for businesses and workers in the transport sector.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;This Government believes in the importance of planning long term and having the ability and resources to implement our plans effectively.</p><p>This is how we developed Singapore into a global aviation and maritime hub, and why we have made significant investments in developing Changi Airport Terminal 5 and Tuas Port.&nbsp;These achievements do not happen automatically and we should never take our hub status and competitive advantages for granted, given the intense global competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Singapore remains a leading maritime hub, achieving new records in 2024. We will continue to build on this momentum to strengthen our competitiveness. Minister of State Murali Pillai will provide more details.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Madam, I will share on our aviation sector which has recovered well from the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 12 months ending February 2025, Changi saw 68.4 million passenger movements, representing a full recovery over pre-COVID-19 levels. The air hub is off to a good start in 2025, with Changi’s passenger numbers exceeding 11.5 million for the first two months of 2025, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We added 11 new city links in 2024, to places like Brussels, Guiyang, Phu Quoc and Vancouver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Our strong performance would not have been possible without the collective efforts of the aviation community. I thank our tripartite partners from the industry and unions for their strong support in helping the air hub to recover and grow, and to our aviation workers for their contributions and hard work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Madam, the future of aviation is bright. Global passenger volumes are expected to double in the next two decades, with the Asia Pacific regions driving half of this growth. As an international business centre and a global air hub, Singapore is well-placed to capture these opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>We will break ground for Terminal 5 (T5) in a few months. T5 will increase Changi’s capacity by 50 million passengers per annum, on top of the current 90 million passengers per annum. T5 will also enhance our hub status and provide new and exciting employment opportunities for our people.</p><h6>4.00 pm</h6><p>Madam, Mr Dennis Tan raised concerns that building T5 would result in more flights and higher aviation emissions. As a member state of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO), Singapore is committed to contributing towards ICAO and IMO’s global ambition of achieving net-zero targets by or around 2050.</p><p>The United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change sets the global reporting requirements for greenhouse gas inventories. Emissions from international aviation and maritime do not accrue to national greenhouse gas inventories. Singapore complies with this.</p><p>Likewise, there is no benefit for Changi to move too far ahead of other airports when it comes to adoption of sustainable aviation fuel. At last year’s COS debate, I explained why we will start with a 1% target in 2026 to spur investments in sustainable aviation fuel production capacity and increase this over time to 3% to 5% by 2030, subject to global developments and the wider availability and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.</p><p>I believe this is a pragmatic approach, because the cost of sustainable aviation fuel is currently much higher than conventional jet fuel, and we need to strike a balance between sustainability and competitiveness. Several countries, including India, Indonesia and the Republic of Korea, have also adopted a 1% initial target before ramping up in subsequent years. The UK started with a 2% sustainable aviation fuel mandate in 2025 and not 10%, as what Mr Tan said.</p><p>Our approach is to enable our aviation sector to grow and improve environmental sustainability concurrently. We launched the Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint last year, which sets out Singapore’s medium and long-term goals for international and domestic emissions, and our plans to achieve them with stakeholders across the airport, airline and air traffic management domains.</p><p>Our air hub is a source of many good jobs for Singaporeans and a key enabler for many other sectors in our economy, such as manufacturing, professional services and tourism. So, I hope Mr Dennis Tan is not suggesting that we should forgo building T5, as that would bring more flights to Singapore. Madam, if our air hub is not competitive, planes will still fly, but they just bypass Changi. How is that good for Singapore and Singaporeans? This Government cares about environmental sustainability, but we also care about the well-being of our people, our workers and our businesses.&nbsp;As Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean said, we are climate realists, not climate zealots.</p><p>While our air hub is well-placed to ride the winds of growth, competition is intensifying. We are mindful about rising costs faced by aviation stakeholders. The Government is committed to working with the aviation industry to improve our service levels, raise productivity and reduce operating costs where possible. If we achieve cost savings, we will share these with our industry partners.</p><p>One of the biggest advantages that Singapore has today over many competitors is our ability to work as one aviation ecosystem and the close tripartite relationship between companies, unions and the Government. We must continue to leverage on this as we look at ways to enhance Changi’s air hub competitiveness.</p><p>To Mr Mark Lee, Ms Poh Li San and Mr Sharael Taha’s questions, we will strengthen our support for Changi in four key areas: Connectivity, Infrastructure, Innovation and Technology, and Manpower.</p><p>The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will commit $1 billion over the next five years to catalyse action and partnership in these four areas. And this is on top of the $5 billion top-up to the Changi Airport Development Fund that the Prime Minister announced. Over the next few months, CAAS will work with companies and union leaders, Government agencies and international partners to develop schemes in each of these areas that will help our companies and workers to thrive and succeed.</p><p>First, on Connectivity. Singapore’s current network of over 160 city links connect us with the world and this is a key enabler for our economy. We aim to build a larger network of over 200 city links by the mid-2030s, to anchor Singapore as a key global node. CAAS will work with economic agencies and industry to identify key links and to develop schemes that can accelerate these new connections.</p><p>Next, on Infrastructure. CAAS will work with aviation stakeholders to plan enabling infrastructure for the Singapore air hub and to coordinate development across companies. It will provide funding support to accelerate the development of common use infrastructure that will benefit all airport users, to support state-of-the-art, efficient and cost-effective airport operations.</p><p>Third, on Innovation and Technology. CAAS will work with the industry and the research community to develop a 10-year technology roadmap to guide technology planning and to translate research and development into operational capabilities that can be deployed across the aviation ecosystem. The technology roadmap will leverage the development of T5 to set up living labs that can be used to testbed and grow new capabilities.</p><p>Fourth, on Manpower. Skilled manpower is a key competitive factor for air hubs around the world. CAAS will work with aviation companies and unions to grow a quality workforce, comprising a strong Singapore Core complemented by foreign workers who are important contributors to Changi’s overall competitiveness. We will invest in skills upgrading for our workers and redesign jobs to better attract and retain local workers. In this way, our air hub can continue to remain competitive and provide good employment opportunities for Singaporeans.</p><p>Madam, besides moving people, Singapore’s transport story is also about moving goods. We will strengthen Changi’s position as a trusted, efficient and well-connected air cargo hub. Let me address Ms Poh Li San’s question on how we will develop our air cargo hub.</p><p>First, capacity. In the mid-2030s, Changi’s handling capacity will increase from 3.0 million to 5.4 million tonnes per annum with the opening of the Changi East Industrial Zone. This will be complemented by the Airport Logistics Park 2 that was announced last year, which will also provide additional capacity to anchor logistics activities, including Regional Distribution Centres and freight forwarding.</p><p>In the lead-up to these developments, we will continue to work with industry partners to ensure we have sufficient capacity to meet growing air cargo demand.</p><p>Changi Airport’s largest cargo handler, SATS, has plans to invest $100 million over the next two years to upgrade its existing air freight terminals at the Changi Airfreight Centre. With this, SATS’ cargo handling capacity will increase by 30%, from 2.3 million tonnes to three million tonnes per annum, and ensure it has sufficient capacity to support growing air cargo demand over the next decade.</p><p>This is a good example of how we work together as a One Aviation Community, to support one another and, ultimately, to enhance Changi’s competitiveness.</p><p>Second, capability. We will harness technology to uplift productivity and allow our cargo workers to optimise their time and resources. CAAS and Changi Airport Group are supporting the air cargo community to implement an ecosystem digital solution for truck dock slot pre-booking, with full roll-out expected later this year.</p><p>This transforms cargo collection and lodgement from a “first-come-first-served” basis, to one that is pre-planned and better optimised. This will raise the productivity and efficiency of current processes. And the outcomes from the initial phase have been promising, with dwell time by truckers reduced by up to 30%. So, I hope this can be scaled up and we can reap more benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Chair, as a nation, we have come together over the last 60 years to improve the lives of Singaporeans and helped many individuals, many families to fulfil their aspirations.</p><p>Transport has played a vital role in this. We built up major transport infrastructure, such as our MRT network, our airport, our seaports, and these have catalysed and enabled the progress of our nation from third-world to first. And we are still building.</p><p>As we navigate through unchartered waters in an increasingly fragmented and volatile world, the key values from our transport journey remain relevant. Singapore must continue to stay open and strengthen our connections with the world. We will always place Singaporeans at the heart of all we do and work with tripartite partners to strengthen our social compact and grow our economy.</p><p>And finally, we will take calculated risks and make bold long-term decisions, as we venture out of our comfort zone to seize new opportunities.</p><p>Madam, transport will continue to be an enduring part of the Singapore Story, as an enabler to improve the lives of Singaporeans, to keep our world moving, and to ensure that we remain connected to the world and to one another. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Amy Khor.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, let me share how we will create more friendly and safe journeys, strengthen connectivity in our land transport system and enable businesses to decarbonise their vehicle fleet for a more liveable and sustainable city.</p><p>At last year’s COS debate, I announced that Friendly Streets would be expanded to all towns by 2030. We have since completed works for the five Friendly Streets pilots. We have also completed engagements and progressively started infrastructure works for the 10 Friendly Streets sites announced last year. These are expected to be completed by 2026.</p><p>This year, we will be launching Friendly Streets at 15 more locations island-wide, including in Bukit Timah, Jurong West, Opera Estate, Queenstown, Thomson and Yishun. These locations have a higher proportion of seniors or young families living in public and private housing estates who will benefit most from the scheme. We will continue to identify more areas suitable to implement Friendly Streets, possibly Seletar Hills estate, as suggested by Ms Ng Ling Ling.</p><p>One of the key features of all Friendly Streets is the emphasis on pedestrian safety, as highlighted by Mr Shawn Huang. That is why Friendly Streets have road humps and narrower road lanes to slow down speeds. Speed limits are also lowered to 40 kilometres per hour.</p><p>To further enhance pedestrian safety, we will roll out the following initiatives from 1 January 2026. Motorists who commit traffic offences that endanger others, such as speeding, running of red light or failing to give way to pedestrians at Friendly Streets, will incur two additional demerit points on top of the prevailing demerit points, a<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">nd an additional $100 in composition sum on top of the prevailing&nbsp;</span>penalties for the offence. These enhanced penalties will then be on par with offences committed at Silver and School Zones.</p><p>We will also extend the lower speed limits for Enhanced School Zones along Primary Schools to full day, instead of only during school arrival and dismissal times. We made this change because school schedules are increasingly more varied and extends beyond the conventional dismissal times.</p><p>Mr Melvin Yong asked agencies to step up enforcement against companies which do not properly secure equipment on board lorries. Agencies will continue to take firm action to enforce this requirement under the Road Traffic Act. It is the responsibility of companies to comply for the safety of their workers and other road users.&nbsp;</p><p>In tandem with Friendly Streets, we are pressing on with our road repurposing projects, with six completed thus far.</p><p>We had previously shared that we were working to enhance the walking and cycling experience in Tanjong Pagar. I am pleased to announce that after engaging stakeholders in the area, we will repurpose the roadside parking lots along Tanjong Pagar Road to provide wider footpaths and cycling paths. Centre dividers and road humps will be added to slow down vehicles. These enhancements will bring about a safer and more comfortable walking and cycling experience between Tanjong Pagar and Maxwell MRT stations.</p><p>We will also embark on two new road repurposing projects at Tampines and Bedok. In Tampines, we observed very high footfall across Tampines Central 5, where around 60,000 pedestrians a day travel between Tampines MRT station and the malls in Tampines. To enhance the commuting experience, we will pedestrianise a 50-metre-long stretch of Tampines Central 5, where commuters can look forward to a seamless walking path between the transport facilities and malls.</p><h6>4.15 pm</h6><p>In Bedok, in collaboration with adviser Cheryl Chan, we will pedestrianise a 90-metre-long stretch of Bedok North Street 4 and close an adjacent HDB car park to create a new community space for residents to come together, and a more comfortable walking experience to and from Bedok 85 Market and Fengshan neighbourhood centre.</p><p>Separately, also in Bedok, Mr Faisal Abdul Manap would be pleased to know that as part of HDB’s upcoming Bedok North Springs BTO, HDB plans to build a high covered linkway across Bedok North Street 3 to Block 509.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, Ms Yeo Wan Ling asked for an update on the point-to-point (P2P) transport industry review.&nbsp;Since PHCs entered the sector in 2013, commuters have benefited from a more responsive P2P supply. Even so, taxis remain important for meeting P2P demand. First, as dedicated P2P vehicles, taxis provide a more stable source of supply throughout the day compared to PHCs. One-shift taxis spend a median of 49 active hours per week serving P2P trips, compared to 34 by PHCs. Second, taxis can offer street-hail services, which remain important for commuters who may be less familiar with local ride-hail apps, and at locations with very high demand.</p><p>At last year’s COS debate, we converged some regulations between PHCs and taxis to make taxis more viable, as they incur higher operating costs due to existing regulatory differences. However, as Mr Ang Wei Neng pointed out, there are still some gaps. This year, we will introduce further changes to the regulatory regime for taxis and PHCs.</p><p>First, we will continue to suspend the growth cap on the taxi fleet. We first suspended the cap in 2021 to help taxi operators replenish their fleet to pre-pandemic numbers. This extended suspension will facilitate the replacement and growth of the taxi fleet.</p><p>Second, we will allow taxi operators to convert used vehicles that are less than five years old to taxis. Instead of just buying new vehicles, taxi operators will have an additional option to grow their fleet, which may help to reduce costs.</p><p>Third, we will allow taxi operators to resell taxis that are more than three years old, capped at 5% of their fleet annually. This will give taxi operators flexibility to resell under-utilised taxis and reduce carrying costs. This added flexibility can also reduce operators’ risks when trialling new taxi models, such as bigger, more expensive multipurpose vehicles which can better serve larger families.</p><p>These moves give taxi operators more flexibility to manage cost and grow their fleet. They complement our moves in the PHC sector to further level the playing field between taxis and PHCs.</p><p>We announced earlier on 19 February that all newly registered, converted or transferred chauffeured PHCs owned by businesses cannot be converted to other vehicle classifications for three years. The main reason for this move is to narrow the regulatory gap between taxis and PHCs. It also helps to stabilise the PHC supply. The three-year holding period for business-owned chauffeured PHCs parallels our requirement that taxi operators maintain their taxis for at least three years before they can be resold.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p>We expect the impact of the measure to be manageable as the majority of bona fide PHC leasing companies already keep their vehicles for more than three years.</p><p>Finally, with immediate effect, we will also require the disclosure of a vehicle’s history as a chauffeured or self-drive PHC, or taxi for all newly registered, converted or transferred vehicles. This will apply to vehicles registered using COEs issued as part of today’s COE bidding exercise. The move will improve transparency in the resale market and further encourage registration of such vehicles only for their intended purposes.</p><p>Beyond these moves, Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked whether we intend to create a separate COE category for business-owned PHCs. We have studied this carefully and decided not to proceed with such a move.</p><p>First, as I had mentioned in this House, the bulk of the demand for Category A and B (Cat A and B) COEs has been from local individuals and not from PHC or car leasing companies. In the most recent bidding in February 2025, business-owned PHCs made up 6% and 8% of successful Cat A and B bids respectively.</p><p>Second, quota from existing categories, such as Cat A and B, will need to be taken away to provide the quota for this new separate category. We have seen that demand for PHCs varies from quarter to quarter, given that fares and driver supply are highly responsive to commuter demand. It is very difficult to accurately determine the COE quota supply for PHCs that is required to meet the needs of drivers and commuters. If we move too much quota away, Cat A and B COE prices will spike because of inadequate remaining quota. Conversely, if we move too little, COE prices for PHCs will be high, with drivers and commuters facing higher rentals and fares.</p><p>Therefore, the allocation between PHCs and private cars is best left to the market. What LTA will do is to continue increasing the COE quota every quarter for Cat A, B and C till the supply peak from 2026, by using the cut-and-fill method and the injection of 20,000 new COE quota.</p><p>As Mr Saktiandi Supaat noted, another key objective of our P2P regulatory regime is to keep the sector open and contestable. This allows commuters and drivers to choose their preferred platform. Competition also encourages operators to innovate and improve service offerings. As of today, around 60% of drivers use multiple platforms.</p><p>While the ride-hail sector is a competitive market, it is also a matching market, and large operators will naturally be better able to match their drivers and commuters. Large operators should, therefore, bear greater responsibility to ensure that market norms continue to protect the interests of commuters and drivers. These additional responsibilities include higher data disclosure obligations to LTA as regulator, and could include sharing more data with drivers, as Ms Jean See has suggested.</p><p>The additional responsibilities sit on top of our broader regulations to promote multi-homing. They are not meant to curb the growth of any operator, whether in Singapore or overseas markets. These responsibilities are to assure drivers and commuters that large operators will not implement practices that may directly or indirectly restrict drivers’ or commuters’ choice, such as imposing minimum trip requirements on drivers.</p><p>We will adopt an iterative approach by reviewing the requirements as operators continue to evolve their practices in response to market competition.</p><p>Mr Gan Thiam Poh raised the importance of P2P services for different groups of commuters. Indeed, as our population ages, we expect more commuters to rely on P2P services. Hence, beyond ensuring a stable supply of taxis, we intend to work with ride-hail operators to make their apps more user-friendly for groups, such as seniors, who are less comfortable with using mobile apps.</p><p>We will invite operators to submit proposals that can improve the accessibility of their P2P services. LTA will provide co-funding of up to 50%, capped at $500,000 for the development of viable ideas via the P2P Inclusivity Co-funding Grant. We plan to allow applications from the fourth quarter of 2025 and for support to be provided up to 2028.</p><p>Additionally, as raised by Mr Eric Chua and in response to requests from PHC drivers and commuters, we will, for a start, convert nine most frequently used taxi stops in the Central Business District to P2P stops for use as pick-up and drop-off points by both taxis and PHCs. We will monitor the impact on road traffic and usage of the converted taxi stops before deciding if this could be expanded to other taxi stops. But taxi stands, where taxis can queue to pick up street-hail commuters, will continue to be for taxis only. This move will make P2P services safer and more convenient for all commuters.</p><p>Moving on, Mr Neil Parekh asked for an update on the EV landscape.</p><p>The adoption of EVs has been healthy. In 2024, about a third of all new cars registered were electric, up from 18% in 2023. The momentum has continued into this year, with the adoption rate increasing to 38% in January.&nbsp;</p><p>Our charging network has continued to expand to support the growing EV population. We have more than 19,000 charging points island-wide, close to half of which are publicly accessible. More than 60% of HDB car parks are equipped with EV chargers. We have made good progress and will ensure all HDB residents who own or wish to own an EV have convenient access to a charger near their homes.</p><p>Deploying the chargers has not been straightforward, as most public car parks were not designed to accommodate EV chargers and allow for a significant draw on electricity. Hence, there are some car parks where the existing electrical infrastructure, like the consumer switch rooms, lack the capacity to support the deployment of EV chargers. For such car parks, we are leveraging technology, such as dynamic load management, to help us optimise existing electricity capacity. This will allow us to install EV chargers to meet the needs of EV owners, even as we work on upgrading the electrical infrastructure.</p><p>Last year, we shared that we will be increasing the number of fast chargers to meet the needs of commercial vehicle owners, including taxi drivers. We have kickstarted the deployment of fast chargers. By the end of this month, 13 HDB shopping complexes and town centres would be equipped with two 50 kilowatt EV chargers each, including at Woodlands Civic Centre and Connection One. More will be progressively deployed over the year at 45 other sites, including Serangoon and Bedok Town Centres, and JTC industrial premises, such as Bulim Square.</p><p>At condominiums, around one in three are equipped with chargers today, in part supported by LTA's EV Common Charger Grant (ECCG), which has since co-funded about 1,700 chargers. To further encourage charger deployment at condominiums, we will expand the ECCG to co-fund an additional 1,500 chargers on top of the original 2,000, but subject to a cap of $3,000 per charger, and extend the grant duration to 31 December 2026.</p><p>To Assoc Prof Jamus Lim’s suggestion to change the COE duration for EVs, I should highlight that the current 10-year duration is not based on the lifespan of vehicles. We implemented a 10-year duration as part of our vehicle quota system for greater equity, so that motorists do not own a car in perpetuity at the expense of future prospective owners.&nbsp;</p><p>Should vehicle owners, including EV owners, decide to deregister their vehicles at any point, they will be able to get a refund of the unused portion of the COE, as well as Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF) rebates. Having different COE validity periods across powertrains will make the COE system unnecessarily complex. Vehicle technologies will continue to change. So, it is not sensible to tie our COE validity periods to specific technologies, let alone the uncertainty of lifespans of EV batteries, as Assoc Prof Lim has noted.&nbsp;</p><p>We must also&nbsp;not forget that after 2020, hybrids will still be allowed. As raised by Ms Poh Li San, Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Neil Parekh, for heavy vehicles, the market for cleaner energy variants is nascent but we are seeing encouraging market developments. Particularly, for some segments of lorries and buses, there are commercially-ready electric models today. This is an area where we can do more to catalyse adoption in the next bound of land transport decarbonisation.</p><p>We will help companies adopt cleaner energy heavy vehicles. As announced by the Minister for Finance at Budget 2025, we will introduce the Heavy Vehicle Zero Emissions Scheme and an Electric Heavy Vehicle Charger Grant.</p><p>Starting from 1 January 2026, we will provide $40,000 in incentives for each new zero-tailpipe emission heavy vehicle registered. We will also provide the first 500 private heavy vehicle chargers co-funding of up to 50% of the charger installation cost, capped at $30,000 per charger.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">These measures will narrow the lifecycle cost gap between an electric and internal combustion engine heavy vehicle and spur adoption of electric heavy vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><h6>4.30 pm</h6><p>Chairman, in conclusion, we will press on to create friendlier and safer journeys for all, while strengthening the connectivity of our land transport system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister of State Murali Pillai.</p><p><strong>The Minister of State for Transport (Mr Murali Pillai)</strong>: Sir, the hon Member Mr Saktiandi Supaat raised the issue of safety on our public buses in his speech. Minister Chee just announced that the Bus Safety Tripartite Taskforce which I chaired has completed its work. The Government accepted the recommendations of the task force and will work closely with our tripartite partners to implement them over the coming years.</p><p>Buses are the workhorses of our roads. Every day, four million trips are made on our public buses by commuters. At the peak, about 6,000 public buses ply our roads. A system at this scale, which includes almost 10,000 bus captains, requires a sustained and unceasing effort to maintain a strong safety record. The Government, together with our tripartite partners, are fully committed to this. But to succeed, we need the public behind us.&nbsp;As part of this effort, the Bus Safety Tripartite Taskforce was formed in July last year.</p><p>The task force approached this exercise in the spirit of ensuring that commuters, bus captains and other road users continue to have strong confidence in the safety of our public buses. We would like to thank all stakeholders who participated in this important work.</p><p>We are starting from a position of strength. The annual number of serious road accidents involving public buses has been stable in the past few years.&nbsp;Nevertheless, there is room to improve. Members of the public gave feedback on bus captains' driving, the design of buses, as well as bus scheduling. Bus captains offered suggestions on similar issues. In addition, they shared real life challenges faced while on the road&nbsp;– motorists encroaching into bus priority boxes, or yellow boxes and bus lanes, as well as with cyclists who cycle close to the blind spots of the buses.</p><p>The task force has taken a serious look at all these suggestions and consulted with both local and international safety practitioners and experts from the bus sector, before arriving at its recommendations.</p><p>Mr Shawn Huang asked how we can better support bus captains in carrying out their role. Indeed, a common thread throughout the task force's discussion is that bus captains have a demanding job.</p><p>In my first meeting with public transport union leaders after we formed this task force, Brother Peh Chee Kang, Vice President of the National Transport Workers' Union, pointed out that driving a public bus is like piloting an aircraft. Besides operating large vehicles through busy streets while staying on schedule, bus captains must also take care of the safety of passengers and help commuters navigate to their destination. Unlike planes, there is no autopilot available for our bus captains. They are constantly multitasking and looking out for other road users.</p><p>The task force was clear that ensuring bus safety means giving our bus captains the best support to do their job well. Our recommendations were focused on two major aspects. First, equipping bus captains with the right tools; and second, providing them with a conducive working environment. Today, I will highlight a few key recommendations.</p><p>The first area is technologies to improve the situational awareness of our bus captains. The task force has recommended that the Government equip our buses with 360-degree collision warning, anti-fatigue and camera mirror systems.</p><p>Bus Captain Mohammed Syazwan Bin Mohammed Salim from Tower Transit Singapore is one of those who experienced first-hand how anti-fatigue systems can enhance road safety. The system actively prompted him when he yawned, which was useful in maintaining his alertness while driving and ensured the safety of the bus captain as well as commuters.</p><p>Second, technology helps our commuters and other road users stay safe when they are on or around buses. In this regard, the task force recommended a number of safety features, such as better torque management, audio safety announcements onboard buses and an enhanced rear electronic display system.</p><p>To address the feedback by bus captains on having to multi-task, LTA will also explore whether the number of display units in the driving cabin can be reduced to lessen the cognitive load on bus captains.</p><p>The Government will review the various technologies recommended by the task force through pilots and study the feasibility of incorporating such technologies into existing fleets and making these technologies a requirement for upcoming bus purchases.</p><p>Ms Yeo Wan Ling asked how we can further improve the working conditions of bus captains to help manage their workload. This brings us to the other major set of recommendations by the task force that deals with the human dimension of safety, focused on creating a more conducive working environment for bus captains to perform their roles effectively.</p><p>We have a range of recommendations in this area, and I will focus on bus runtimes and training for bus captains, which we believe will have the broadest impact.</p><p>Firstly, on the management of runtime. The runtime is the total time taken for a bus captain to complete a route. It affects safety because if runtimes are not scheduled correctly, bus captains come under pressure to stay on schedule. Today, bus operators, bus captains, together with LTA, already do regular reviews of runtimes to account for changes in traffic conditions and travel patterns. They will continue to do so.</p><p>But beyond having realistic runtimes, the task force felt that runtimes should not be too long. As Mr Ang Wei Neng pointed out, we have some routes with scheduled runtimes exceeding two hours, and bus captains gave feedback that such prolonged periods of continuous driving can cause discomfort for them, such as the need for toilet breaks, and could cause lapses in concentration.</p><p>LTA has committed to not introducing bus routes with scheduled runtimes exceeding two hours. In addition, LTA and bus operators will review our existing bus services with long runtimes, to see how we can make them more manageable for our bus captains, such as by adjusting the routes or swapping bus captains in the middle of a long route. As any adjustments will have an impact on commuters, we will review such routes carefully and implement any changes progressively.</p><p>Besides scheduling, the task force made a number of recommendations on bus captain training. In our engagements, the task force observed different models, both locally and abroad, of how a strong training regime can make a difference to driver confidence and retention. Some of the good practices we saw, such as more personalised training and peer support, can be more prevalent across the bus sector.</p><p>I am glad to announce that we will be introducing an industry-wide training point system, as recommended by the task force. Under this system, bus operators will track the number of training points that their bus captains obtain per year, corresponding to a baseline level of continuing training each year. This ensures that all bus captains receive the necessary training to refresh their skills and keep up to date with best practices.</p><p>On the Government's part, the Singapore Bus Academy will improve its training offerings, to better support bus operators and bus captains to achieve their training targets. We will share more details on these in due course.</p><p>Besides improving the working conditions for our bus captains, Mr Saktiandi will be glad to note that the task force has also made several recommendations to improve the road environment to better support bus operations.</p><p>One aspect that affects all road users is the management of road works. Bus captains told us that they encounter situations where barriers are placed improperly, resulting in difficulty faced in manoeuvring buses through affected stretches, or when inexperienced road marshals do not provide proper guidance.</p><p>To address this issue, LTA will work with relevant agencies to upskill workers responsible for managing traffic during road works, to make sure that contractors are able to comply with regulations. We will also review the penalty framework, to take a tougher stance against contractors who do not comply and cause obstructions.</p><p>Finally, commuters and other road users have an important role to play, too, in ensuring the safety of buses. LTA and the bus operators will continue to work with organisations, such as Traffic Police and the Singapore Road Safety Council, to carry out publicity efforts to improve commuters' awareness of&nbsp;safe practices onboard buses, as well as other road users' awareness of and compliance with measures to facilitate bus movement.&nbsp;We will provide more details on how we will be implementing these and other recommendations of the task force in due course.</p><p>Let me now turn to Maritime Singapore.&nbsp;As Minister Chee mentioned, Maritime Singapore did well last year, breaking several records. Annual vessel arrival tonnage reached 3.11 billion gross tonnage, and Singapore's container throughput crossed 40 million twenty-foot equivalent units, or TEUs, for the first time. Total bunker sales hit a new record of 54.92 million tonnes, with sales of alternative fuel crossing the one million tonne mark for the first time. The International Maritime Centre grew in scale and diversity, too, with close to 200 shipping groups with a presence in Singapore and more than 30 companies were established or expanded operations here.</p><p>Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked how we achieved these records. These achievements did not come easy. While other ports in countries with more land and labour can compete on cost and larger consumption bases, Singapore competes on efficiency and reliability. Due to the Red Sea crisis and congestion in ports around the world, shipping lines relied on Singapore to handle increasingly complex cargo movements and demand as they unloaded cargoes bound for Asian ports beyond Singapore and used Singapore to rearrange containers on vessels to mitigate delays.</p><p>Through these challenges, we remained resilient, thanks to our tripartite partners and the hard work of our maritime workers.</p><p>With strong competition and an uncertain outlook ahead, we cannot rest on our laurels. Because of our stable political environment, we are able to plan and build for the future with the multi-decade development of Tuas Port. Ms Yeo Wan Ling asked for an update. Eleven berths are operational and seven more are scheduled to commence operations by 2027. When completed in the 2040s, Tuas Port will have more than 60 berths.</p><p>As Prime Minister Wong said in his Budget speech, global economic competition is intensifying and we will be left behind if we fail to stay competitive.</p><p>Mr Saktiandi Supaat also asked how we will ensure that we remain competitive amidst fierce competition in the region. We plan to seize&nbsp;opportunities amidst future growth and challenges&nbsp;in three areas. First, technology; second. decarbonisation; and third, talent development.</p><p>On technology, we are leveraging technology to sharpen Maritime Singapore's competitive edge.</p><p>To Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Ms Poh Li San's questions, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) will use technology to streamline port and marine services to enable the industry to enjoy higher productivity and reduced costs and manpower needs.</p><h6>4.45 pm</h6><p>One example is the use of AI to streamline the processing of Port Clearance Certificates by reducing the need to manually input information from multiple ship certificates. This system will be implemented over the next few years and enhance the accuracy of data entry and verification, and reduce the time taken to obtain the Certificate from up to three days to just a few minutes!</p><p>We will facilitate the development of new solutions for the maritime ecosystem. We will be expanding our maritime innovation test-beds and regulatory sandboxes to more locations within the port for testing of new solutions, such as remote or autonomous operations.</p><p>MPA is on track to complete the third and final phase of Maritime 5G coverage by this year. Stronger connectivity, more consistent data coverage and bandwidth will enable the provision of new maritime services.&nbsp;Together, this means that successful pilots for innovative solutions will more quickly become a part of day-to-day port operations. We will also develop response capabilities using drones to track and enhance safety for first responders.</p><p>Next, we will position ourselves as a bunkering hub for alternative fuels. Building on our hard-earned reputation as a reliable bunkering hub, we are committed to support the industry's safe transition to alternative fuels.</p><p>To answer Mr Neil Parekh's question, we are taking the lead to develop Technical References for alternative fuels, which provide shipping companies better quality and quantity assurance when bunkering alternative fuels in Singapore.&nbsp;We are upgrading the provisional national quality standard for marine biofuel into a Technical Reference to include biofuel blends up to 100% biofuel and non-FAME products. This complements the International Maritime Organization's recent announcement that conventional oil tankers may soon be allowed to carry biofuel blends containing up to 30% biofuel, instead of the current limit of 25% biofuel.</p><p>For methanol bunkering, two sets of standards will be launched in March 2025. MPA and Enterprise Singapore will launch a standard on the requirements for methanol bunkering and MPA will launch standards on the equipment and operational efficiency for methanol bunker tankers. This marks an important step towards operationalising methanol bunkering at scale in our port. We are also targeting to launch a new standard for ammonia bunkering this year.</p><p>Finally, we will press on with talent development.&nbsp;Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Neil Parekh and Ms Yeo Wan Ling asked how we can ensure that we have a robust pipeline of talent with the right skills and competencies to maintain the competitiveness and productivity of Maritime Singapore.</p><p>MPA, together with industries and unions, are doing so at two levels: first, we will groom future leaders of the industry by raising the annual intake of the Maritime Leadership Programme (MLP), from about 20 to 25 places, to admit industry leaders from adjacent trading and logistics sectors.</p><p>MPA will also support the onboarding of MLP alumni to the Singapore Leaders' Network, a leadership community that prepares Singaporeans for regional and global leadership roles by providing overseas transition support and mentorship opportunities. Together, these changes will strengthen cross-sector collaboration and provide opportunities for maritime professionals to learn about adjacent sectors and vice versa.</p><p>Second, we are equipping workers with new skills to better meet industry needs. MPA has established the Maritime Energy Training Facility to train the global maritime workforce in safe handling and operating of vessels using alternative fuels. MPA is also on track to launch the Maritime Testbed of Shipboard Operational Technology System (MariOT) by March 2025, which provides training in cybersecurity for operational technology systems in a realistic shipboard environment. Over the next three years, we expect more than 300 students and professionals to benefit from this simulation platform.</p><p>Working with our partners, we will continue to invest in a strong pipeline of talent to the maritime industry. Sir, transport is a vital public service that moves people across our island and plugs our economy into the open seas. On both land and sea, you will see that it is our people that makes the difference and this Government will continue to invest in this critical human dimension, for now and into the future.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng.</p><p><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, allow me to share how we are making journeys on public paths and public transport safer and more comfortable.</p><p>First, as announced last year, we will implement new rules to curb the misuse of Personal Mobility Aids (PMAs). Second, we will improve the commuting experience on public transport, by rejuvenating our stations and cultivating a better commuting culture.</p><p>Last year, the Government accepted the Active Mobility Advisory Panel's (AMAP's) recommendations to tighten regulations for PMAs. We have observed more able-bodied individuals misusing PMAs, which are meant for those with mobility needs. Speeding and overly large PMAs have also caused anxiety and concern. We need these new rules to improve path safety, especially for vulnerable users, like young children and seniors.</p><p>Ms Jean See and Ms Poh Li San asked for an update on the new rules, while Mr Eric Chua asked how we can improve path safety. To implement the rules, we need to amend legislation and we are scheduled to do so through Parliament later this year. We will provide sufficient transition time for users and other stakeholders.</p><p>I will now share more details on how we plan to implement the new PMA rules. First, we intend to reduce the speed limit for riding PMAs on public paths from 10 kilometres per hour to six kilometres per hour, from the first&nbsp;quarter of 2026. The exact timeline will depend on when we can amend&nbsp;legislation. Six kilometres per hour is the same speed as a brisk walker, so that is a reasonable top speed allowable since PMAs are meant for those with walking difficulties.</p><p>Second, we will align the PMA dimension restrictions on public paths with those on public transport, also from the first quarter of 2026. This means individuals should not ride a PMA exceeding a width of 70 centimetres, a length of 120 centimetres, a height of 150 centimetres and a laden weight of 300 kilogrammes.</p><p>We will make it an offence to display, advertise and sell PMAs exceeding the dimension limits, or with device speed limit above six kilometres per hour. Based on checks with several retailers, many have already stopped selling such PMAs or are clearing limited stock.</p><p>We understand that genuine users may own PMAs that can go up to 10 kilometres per hour, based on the current rule. We will allow PMAs with a device speed limit of up to 10 kilometres per hour to be used on public paths until end-2028. However, they must be used safely within the new speed limit of six kilometres per hour and comply with the upcoming dimension limits. To monitor the speed, PMA users may take reference from the walking speeds of other path users or use a physical speedometer or mobile application.</p><p>Third, only those with genuine medical needs will be allowed to use a mobility scooter. Since last year, we have engaged stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, to develop a certification process. MOH will engage and provide guidelines to the medical community ahead of implementation. This requirement for certification does not apply to motorised wheelchair users.</p><p>From the fourth quarter of this year, we will implement the Assessment for Mobility Scooter (AMS). Under AMS, users with medical conditions which result in mobility difficulties will be certified to need a mobility scooter.</p><p>Before the commencement of AMS, those who were prescribed a mobility scooter subsidised by the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF), under the Agency for Integrated Care; or the Assistive Technology Fund (ATF) under SG Enable, will automatically be certified without having to do anything.&nbsp;Individuals with an existing non-subsidised mobility scooter or who intend to obtain a mobility scooter, should visit their regular doctor for an AMS.</p><p>Those purchasing an SMF- or ATF-subsidised mobility scooter&nbsp;for the first time should obtain an AMS through their regular doctor or Occupational Therapist at their existing touchpoints. For most new SMF or ATF clients, AMS will not add any extra steps to the current&nbsp;subsidy application process.</p><p>From the first quarter of 2026, mobility scooter users on public paths must have this certification of need. We will give users some time to obtain&nbsp;the certification, and enforcement officers will engage and educate users on&nbsp;the new rules during this transition period. Users do not have to approach healthcare professionals to obtain certification now. Please wait for more details to be released in the third quarter of this year.</p><p>We understand that some genuine PMA users who do deliveries are concerned that the reduced speed limit will affect earnings. Together with delivery platforms and the National Delivery Champions Association, we&nbsp;have just issued a joint statement on this. The delivery platforms have given&nbsp;assurance that they will continue to be inclusive on their platforms, in terms of job allocation and managing customer expectations.</p><p>In addition, the&nbsp;Government will continue working with stakeholders to enhance the infrastructure and processes supporting last-mile deliveries at developments. Taken together, we hope these new rules will curb the misuse of PMAs and improve safety for all path users.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan raised concerns on safety risks from non-compliant motorised Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) and Power-Assisted Bicycles (PABs), both the device itself and its use on public transport.</p><p>Over the years, we have put in place stringent measures and safety standards to mitigate the risks of motorised PMDs and PABs. Our&nbsp;enforcement officers conduct operations daily against non-compliant devices&nbsp;on paths and we take action against retailers selling non-compliant devices or those that illegally modify devices. However, challenges remain with online sales and illegal modifications.</p><p>We have observed incidents in other cities where such devices caught&nbsp;fire on public transport, resulting in injuries and the banning of such devices from public transport. While there has not been any fire incident involving&nbsp;such devices on our trains and buses so far, the safety risk is amplified in&nbsp;such enclosed crowded spaces, with potentially serious consequences to surrounding passengers.</p><p>As such, AMAP will be consulting the public on the safety and mobility needs of commuters, before making its recommendations to the Government. Thereafter, we will review the regulations on motorised PMDs and PABs on public transport.</p><p>Sir, another aspect of making commuters feel safe and comfortable is the behaviour of fellow commuters on public transport. Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Dennis Tan raised feedback on inconsiderate&nbsp;commuters who eat and drink, play loud music and pose a nuisance to other commuters. In more egregious cases, some harass others and even challenge our bus captains.</p><p>Public transport is a shared space and such behaviour affects the commuting experience for everyone. At worst, it can make people feel unsafe about travelling on public transport.</p><h6>5.00 pm</h6><p>We have therefore increased patrolling and enforcement against such offences on both trains and buses, and will be strengthening our regulatory powers to act against inconsiderate behaviour.</p><p>At present, our regulatory power to manage commuter behaviour onboard buses is more limited than on rail. As a first step, we are working with our public bus operators to put in place Conditions of Carriage. These conditions will provide for a safe and comfortable experience for commuters and bus captains. It will set out what transport workers can do to alleviate situations with uncooperative commuters. In egregious cases, bus captains can instruct disruptive commuters to alight from the bus, or if necessary, activate the Police.</p><p>By next year, our regulatory framework against inconsiderate behaviour will be aligned across trains and buses. Those who behave egregiously will face penalties commensurate with the severity of their impact on other commuters, with higher penalties for repeat offenders. I thank Mr Dennis Tan for his suggestions – the use of loudspeakers on public transport is one of the nuisance behaviours we are looking at, and we will consider the suggestion of using a decibel threshold to define disruptive noise.</p><p>We recognise that some cases involved commuters who may be experiencing a mental health episode and what they need is support. Our officers will exercise discretion in applying these regulations.</p><p>To complement these, we will continue to promote gracious journeys, with more signages and public announcements to encourage positive behaviour, such as keeping volumes low and occupying only one seat.</p><p>Commuters can also make journeys more gracious by looking out for those in need. In 2023, I had announced the expansion of the \"Helping Hand\" scheme, with cards indicating, for example, a commuter’s need for a seat. Recognising that commuters have different needs we will be launching a universal Helping Hand card with a blank space where commuters can write their specific needs. This will be in addition to the earlier issued cards.</p><p>With these measures, I hope that all commuters will play their part in fostering safer and more gracious journeys.</p><p>Sir, the Minister spoke about prioritising the commuter experience in the coming years. Let me share more on how we are enhancing commuter infrastructure for more comfortable and enjoyable journeys.</p><p>Just as we rejuvenate older estates, we want to make sure that commuter infrastructure keeps pace with changing needs. For example, after the completion of the Woodlands Extension in 1996, the total daily ridership for the North-South and East-West lines stood at about 900,000. Today, that number has grown to 1.6 million.</p><p>Our infrastructure must also be inclusive, especially for seniors and those who need more assistance with navigation.</p><p>We have continually improved our MRT stations over the years.&nbsp;Certain high-traffic stations, like City Hall and Raffles Place, are undergoing enhancements, such as new lighting and air-conditioning systems, upgraded toilets and clearer signages.</p><p>When a new line connects to an existing station, we improve pedestrian walkways and include new entrances and exits for better accessibility and crowd management.&nbsp;For example, when linking Orchard station along the North-South Line with the Thomson-East Coast Line, we installed more escalators and travellators and new entrances serving surrounding malls.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides nearby transport nodes, we also endeavour to provide covered linkways from new stations to key developments. We seek Mr Lim Biow Chuan’s understanding that these sometimes come after new stations are opened, as more time is needed to address differing stakeholder requirements.</p><p>Beyond these station improvements that have taken place over time, we are planning for a refresh of our North-South/East-West Line stations to accommodate increasing ridership and to ensure a more seamless, comfortable commute. We will study how the positive lessons from the newest Thomson-East Coast Line, which has been well received by commuters, can be applied to older stations. These improvements could include making stations more accessible, with additional escalators and lifts; improving navigation, with better wayfinding signages; and making our spaces more pleasant, with upgraded amenities like toilets and services for commuters.</p><p>We are currently looking at Yishun station as our first case study. Yishun is one of our older North-South Line stations. In recent years, the station has become busier and we expect more commuters as surrounding developments are completed.&nbsp;We will study whether the station platform can be extended to ease crowding during peak hours.&nbsp;We may add escalators, lifts and access points to facilitate the flow of commuters.&nbsp;We will also explore how we can improve the transfer experience, with upgrades to the bus stop, drop-off point and taxi stand, and new covered linkways to enhance shelter to nearby locations.</p><p>Before the Yishun case study is finalised, we have already made plans for improvements to North-South-East-West Line stations that will become interchanges with the upcoming Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line. These include Choa Chu Kang and Boon Lay stations, with works to be completed in 2027;&nbsp;Jurong East station, in 2028;&nbsp;Pasir Ris and Ang Mo Kio stations, in 2030; and&nbsp;Clementi station, in 2032.</p><p>Beyond these infrastructural enhancements, we also want to re-imagine public transport spaces to better serve commuters and the community.&nbsp;For example, the new Punggol Coast Station on the North-East Line has a civic common space where residents, students from the Singapore Institute of Technology and people working in the Punggol Digital District can enjoy and interact.</p><p>Our public transport operators have already been working with the communities to improve the vibrancy of stations and interchanges. We will find opportunities to create more vibrant spaces such as by repurposing underutilised areas to support community and commercial uses.&nbsp;More details will be shared when our studies are completed.</p><p>So, now let me now say a few words in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20250305/vernacular-Baey Yam Keng MOT 5Mar 2025 -Chinese (mot).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>Last year, we announced that the Government had accepted recommendations to tighten regulations on Personal Mobility Aids (PMAs) to curb misuse by able-bodied individuals and ensure that the sale and use of PMAs would be safe and sustainable. We intend to commence the new rules from the first quarter of 2026, to ensure that users and retailers have sufficient time to get used to the new rules.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the new rules, riding a PMA on public paths above a speed of 6km/h and using or selling oversized PMAs will be an offence.</p><p>To curb the misuse of mobility scooters, from the first quarter of 2026, users will be required to have a certification of medical need to ride on public paths. From the fourth quarter of this year, users can visit their regular doctor to obtain this certification of medical need. We will release more details in the third quarter of this year and provide sufficient transition time. Users do not have to approach healthcare professionals to obtain certification now. This requirement for certification is only for mobility scooter users and does not apply to motorised wheelchair users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We hope that these rules will ensure that PMAs are used responsibly, improving path safety.</p><p>We also hope that commuters enjoy a safe and comfortable journey on public transport. Unfortunately, we have been receiving increased feedback on inconsiderate commuter behaviour on public transport. This includes commuters consuming food and drink, or playing loud music or videos on their mobile devices. Some commuters have even soiled our train stations, or harassed others.</p><p>Thus, to maintain a positive travel experience for commuters, we will be strengthening our regulatory powers to act against inconsiderate behaviour, with the penalty increasing for repeat offenders. Public transport is a shared space. We hope that all commuters will play their part to be considerate and foster more comfortable and pleasant journeys.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Chairman, in conclusion, we will continue making journeys on public transport and public paths safer and more comfortable. We look forward to the support of commuters in understanding and abiding by the regulations. Together, let us build a more gracious commuter culture.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Clarification time. Mr Saktiandi Supaat.</p><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have three short clarifications.&nbsp;First of all, I would like to thank Minister for his very detailed speech earlier, indicating about $1 billion to strengthen rail capabilities and skills upgrading. The other good news is about the Seletar Line and Tengah Line going through Singapore. As he mentioned, hopefully, it will through Toa Payoh, and not only Toa Payoh but Toa Payoh East as well.</p><p>My first question, Mr Chairman, is in regard to Senior Minister of State Amy Khor's speech. She mentioned about the extension of the areas around schools. When it comes around that, in terms of enforcement, will there be enhancement in terms of surveillance and monitoring around the schools because it is now going to be 24/7&nbsp;around the school and how will you enforce that?&nbsp;Because originally, it was only during school hours. But as you mentioned, the school hours are becoming a bit more adaptable and dynamic, so, whether there will be enhanced cameras, surveillance and monitoring systems, and whether we will be working with other agencies to enhance that. Because the safety of our children and our students is very important, and I am very particular about that.</p><p>Second,&nbsp;to Minister of State Murali, he mentioned about the public bus safety review. He highlighted, very importantly, that driving a bus is like flying a plane, if I am not mistaken. It is like flying a plane.&nbsp;Pilots do regular health check-ups, on a regular basis. I was intently hearing your explanation earlier, but I could not sort of capture whether there were any enhancements in terms of check-ups for our bus captains on a regular basis and whether there will be improvements or enhancements for bus captains going forward, or is it already in the plan in terms of the review?</p><p>My third question, Mr Chairman, is in terms of Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey's speech earlier about medical certification or certificate of needs. I just want to&nbsp;clarify whether the cost will be free. Some of them may already have medical certification before, so, whether there be some leeway in terms of cost issues for them. Because he mentioned that more details will be announced after third quarter, some of them be concerned about how they can expect to apply for this certificate of need and how they will apply for them with the doctors; and whether there are cost issues concerned, whether existing ones can actually travel, can be applied going forward.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Saktiandi, your three short clarifications are not so short. Minister of State Murali.</p><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong>: Sir, in relation to the question posed by the hon Member Mr Saktiandi Supaat on whether there will be medical reviews for the bus drivers, firstly, may I just clarify that the drawing of a parallel between a bus captain and a pilot was made by Brother Peh, the Vice President of the National Transport Workers' Union. I can understand why he made that comparison.</p><p>As far as regular check-ups are concerned, I am personally aware that this is something that is done through the tripartite mechanism with the unions as well as the public transport operators and perhaps, we could look at that area to see what else can be done.</p><h6>5.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Baey Yam Keng</strong>: Sir, in response to Mr Saktiandi's question, as I said, for those who were already receiving assistance when they buy their PMAs, they do not have to do any additional certification. But for those who need to get the certification, they can apply through the current process, they will receive the grants based on the means testing basis. And for those who do not meet the means testing requirements, they need to pay a fee for the doctors to give them the certification. More details will be released by MOH later this year, so we urge potential users to look out for that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>: With regard to the extension of the lower speed limit to school zones for full day, we will work with the relevant agencies on the enhanced enforcements. In addition, there will be clear signages and so on to let motorists know that the lower speed limit is for the full day, as well as, of course, work with the various stakeholders like the schools and the residents in the area.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: I see many hands. So, I am going to request all Members to really keep it short and, likewise, the answers. Mr Neil Parekh.</p><p><strong>Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant</strong>: I want to thank Minister Chee, the Senior Minister of State, Minister of State and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for their very detailed explanation of the Budget for next year. I just have one question. In your view, what is the key enabler or enablers, I should say, that will ensure Singapore remains a leading global supply chain hub.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Neil Parekh for his question. I think this is an important topic to focus on, especially in our current environment where we see more volatility and more disruptions to trade flows and supply chains.</p><p>What are the key enablers that will ensure that Singapore can retain our competitive advantage? I did say in my speech earlier, Mr Chairman, that we must not assume that our current hub status and our competitive advantage will be there forever. The competition is very intense and we do need to make sure that we continue to improve, to upgrade our capabilities to be able to meet with this rising competition. There are a few key enablers in my mind that I think would be critical.</p><p>First, is our strong tripartite partnership. This is a key strength for Singapore, and the tripartite partners – the employers, the unions, the Government – we work closely together to achieve a win-win outcome for all stakeholders. And this is something which allows us to be able to overcome obstacles, deal with crisis, including during COVID-19, and to be able to seize new opportunities.</p><p>Second, I would say one of our advantages is to be able to work as an ecosystem in an integrated manner. So, we do not just work in silos. We bring the stakeholders together, and whether it is within the Government, across different Government agencies, or with the private sector and the unions, we are able to then look at what will be the best solution as a whole and maximise our collective strength.</p><p>Third, long-term planning, because many of these capabilities, whether is it hardware, infrastructure, skills upgrading, you cannot ramp up at the last minute. You need a runway. So, because of that, this element in our process, in the way we work, long-term planning, I think will be quite critical, and you can see that in our planning for Terminal 5 and for Tuas Port,</p><p>And I will add a last one, which I think is an area that we need to continue to work on, which is to use the three advantages that I mentioned earlier&nbsp;– tripartism, our ecosystem integration, and with the ability to plan long term&nbsp;– to also look at how we can continuously review and improve our regulatory environment for businesses, to reduce regulatory burdens, business costs, to be able to support new technologies and innovations.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Ang Wei Neng.</p><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng</strong>: Chairman, I have a clarification for the Minister. The Minister announced that there will be new bus services under the Bus Enhancement Plan this year, in 2025, but none of these services will ply Jurong West. And we know the Jurong Regional Line will only come to Jurong in two to three years' time. So, I hope the Minister can add new services in Jurong West this year, especially linking the residents to essential services like polyclinics, and not have to walk 170 metres.</p><p>The second question is on the upgrading of bus stops. Many existing bus stops in Jurong West are old. Some have not been painted for years. So, may I know what is LTA's plan and timeline for upgrading the bus stops in Singapore, including those in Jurong West?</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Chairman, I want to assure Mr Ang that we will certainly follow up with him and his team in Jurong West to take a look at what are the areas for improvement.</p><p>For the Bus Connectivity Enhancement Programme, we do need to look at the local situations, the ridership, the demand, but I think based on what Mr Ang has shared, I will certainly ask LTA colleagues to have a good discussion with him and his colleagues to see whether we are able to make some improvements. Bus stops, I will also ask LTA to follow up with Mr Ang.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Melvin Yong.</p><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye</strong>: Mr Chairman, I believe my concerns with regard to the deployment of autonomous buses in Singapore were not addressed. So, can I ask the Minister to provide an update on the plans to deploy these autonomous buses and what is the road map? How many public transport workers, in particular, the bus captains and the bus technicians, will be affected in such a roll-out? Are there any plans to ensure that the affected workers are suitably upskilled, reskilled and redeployed in advance?</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Chairman, Mr Melvin Yong and the union leaders from NTWU have been working very closely with us on the autonomous vehicles pilot. And Ms Yeo Wan Ling has taken over from Mr Yong, and I think that partnership continues.</p><p>So, I want to assure Mr Yong that we will involve the unions closely in this pilot, because we understand that there will be an impact on workers and we want to assure our workers that when we make some of these changes we will bring the workers along with us, and if there are some jobs that will be affected as a result of the implementation of new technologies, we will help our workers to be able to make the transition.</p><p>Mr Chairman, we intend to start the deployment of the autonomous vehicle shuttles with routes that are not so challenging. So, the first will be Service 400, which serves the Marina Bay South and Shenton Bay area, and the second one is Service 191 in one-north after that.</p><p>We have launched a Request for Proposal in January to purchase autonomous buses for this pilot and we intend to award the contract by the end of this year, and so to get the pilot started, and then we can learn from the experience as we go along, both from the operator's point of view, but also from the union's point of view and then to see what we can do together to give assurance to our workers.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Dennis Tan.</p><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong</strong>:&nbsp;I thank Minister Chee and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey for their answers to the issues I have raised. I would like to assure the Minister that, as a Singaporean, I would also hope that our T5 plans will succeed in ensuring that Singapore can remain as a global air hub and a regional air hub, and I assure the Minister of that.</p><p>I think the Minister may have misunderstood the spirit or the thrust of my question in my Budget debate speech. Basically, in essence, I was asking how will we step up in the next few years to mitigate any increase in the aviation emissions arising from the opening of T5 with the increase in the number of flights.</p><p>And I just want to make a clarification regarding what I said about Heathrow. Sir, Heathrow has set a target to hit 11% sustainable air fuel by 2030, not now. I was not talking about now, but it is 11%. I did say 10% but I could have made a mistake mixing it up with the UK government's mandate for sustainable aviation fuel to hit the target of 10% by 2030.</p><p>Likewise, I think there are also other countries like Japan which is also aiming for 10% by 2030. So, I do hope and I would support Singapore's effort to continue for its mitigation efforts to deal with the aviation emissions even as we expand our airport.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I first want to thank Mr Tan for his clarification and for stating clearly his position that he supports the development of T5 and for our air hub at Changi to remain competitive. So, I wanted to thank Mr Tan for that indeed because the competitiveness of our air hub is one of the goals. But as I mentioned in my speech, we also want to make sure that we grow in a sustainable manner. So, both objectives are important. And for the second one on sustainability, we will pay attention to a few aspects. Of course, the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel is one. We will look at whether we can ramp up our adoption, moving in tandem with global developments and the availability of supply, because that is one constraint that affects many airlines at the moment.</p><p>New investments in production capacity will be needed to be able to increase supply, then to be able to support higher levels of sustainable aviation fuel adoption.</p><p>But besides sustainable aviation fuel, we also want to look at how we design the airport&nbsp;– and T5 will incorporate this&nbsp;– to be an environmentally sustainable airport. So, the way the airport operates, both the air side operations, and also on the passenger side, how we use energy efficiency measures to reduce energy consumption, to be able to maximise our usage of renewable energy, and also one other aspect which we are looking at is to use technology to improve air traffic management, because if you can reduce the time that the planes are circling and waiting up in the skies, and you can, through that process, reduce fuel consumption, I think that is also another way to be able to help businesses to save cost and reduce carbon emissions.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Jean See.</p><p><strong>Ms See Jinli Jean</strong>: Speaker, I just wanted to point out that my question relating to safety of occupational drivers was not responded to. So, could I perhaps ask the Minister of State what are actually the Ministry's plans in working with stakeholders to reinforce the shared responsibility for safety of occupational drivers, who could be PHV drivers as well as heavy vehicle drivers?</p><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, in relation to the occupational drivers, some of the recommendations that we have made under the Bus Safety Tripartite Taskforce may be reviewed to see whether they are applicable. As the hon Member would appreciate, my focus or at least my task force's focus, was really looking at the bus captains in the public transport arena, and not in the private sector. And perhaps it is time to visit these recommendations with them and see what can be taken on board.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Mark Lee.</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee</strong>: The Minister mentioned an additional $1 billion on top of the existing $5 billion top-up to support Changi Airport's expansion and connectivity. Could you share on the measures or initiatives that will enable smaller enterprises, especially SMEs, to enable them to tap into new business opportunities arising as Changi continues to grow?</p><p>Mr Chairman, I think when we invest in growing our airhub, there will be direct and indirect benefits that will flow to the ecosystem, including our local companies, our SMEs. So, I do not want to be too specific because really depends on how they intend to execute some of these plans, but broadly, I would say, on infrastructure, because that was one of the areas that I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;</p><h6>5.30 pm</h6><p>When we build infrastructure, I think there will be opportunities to involve some of our local companies. Some of them may be big enough to take on the contracts as the main contractor, but some of them may not be big enough, but they can pair up with the bigger companies, whether local or foreign. And then they can participate in the process as well and build up their track records. So, that is one area.</p><p>Second area on innovation and technology. I think we also have some good local companies that have good technology solutions to offer and I think they can help to optimise the airport operations, including whether there are ways to improve environmental sustainability, as what Mr Tan mentioned earlier. I think these are also areas that we can involve the local companies.</p><p>And finally, on manpower. Because skills upgrading will be important, some of our local SMEs are also involved in this space as training providers. So, I think that will also be another possible area that they can benefit.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;We have time for two more clarifications. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the 10-year COE duration is not currently tied to the life cycle of the vehicle, but as I explained in my cut, then-Minister for Communications and Information Yeo Ning Hong had said that it was tied to the limit for Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF) benefits. But my point is actually that this duration is arbitrary and we needlessly tie ourselves to a legacy duration that may be misaligned with what will be reasonable in terms of a key component of an EV, which is the battery.</p><p>Senior Minister of State Amy Khor has indicated that a system of multiple COE durations could become unwieldy. Although, of course, now we seem to manage a two-duration system with no issues. But based on what MOT has already announced, it will anyhow phase out the issuance of internal combustion engine (ICE)-COE starting in 2030 and the local fleet will be all EV by 2040. If so, would a change in duration not be considered at this&nbsp;later point in the future?</p><p><strong>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>: As I have noted in my reply and as the learned Assoc Prof has also said, definitely the validity period of the COE is not tied to the lifespan of the vehicle. When we implemented this, we put a validity period of 10 years. Actually, as I have said, it is really for greater equity, so that motorist do not own a car in perpetuity at the expense of future car owners.</p><p>So, this 10-year period really is a good balance between certainty for existing owners and a good chance, a chance for somebody who may wish to purchase a car. And it also happens to tie-in with the time limit for the PARF benefits, which is actually, to encourage vehicle fleet renewal in Singapore, is still relevant.</p><p>And as I have said, we have been using this validity period, monitoring. It has worked well. We will continue to, as we have done, take in feedback from stakeholders, interested parties and monitor the appropriateness of this validity period.</p><p>But having said that, even the two system&nbsp;– 10-year and five-year – the five-year was a concession for owners whose COE was expiring. They did not think that the cars would last for more than five years and we gave a concession for the five-year renewal. But that is only one time. If they renew for five years, they will not be able to renew again. So, the system has not really got multiple COE validity periods.</p><p>And as I have said, actually, we are technology agnostic, too, in the sense that technology evolves. We want cleaner energy vehicles, but it does not have to be EV, although at this point in time, EV is the most viable. But technology changes, evolves. In fact, I checked ChatGPT too, lifespan of EV batteries is 10 to 20 years. Warranty, eight years, but some companies are already giving 10 years. So, I think it is not really sensible to tie it to a specific technology.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Yeo Wan Ling and Ms Ng Ling Ling, I am sorry we have run out of time. So, can I invite Mr Saktiandi Supaat if you would like to draw your amendment?</p><h6>5.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong>: Mr Chairman, I would like to highlight that I am thankful to all the 19 Members and who have asked questions. We have 55 questions for MOT this year; which is almost 30% to 35% increase from last year. This is a testament to the work that MOT and the One Transport Family has been doing for the past year and going forward as well, given that the work is not just for this year, but also for many decades down the road.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Minister Chee Hong Tat, Senior Minister of State, Minister of State, Senior Parliamentary Secretary and, of course, the One Transport Family, all the staff, including those from LTA, MPA, CAAS; and as Minister mentioned, the importance of our tripartite partners to make sure that MOT work and Singapore is well taken care of.</p><p>On that note, Mr Chairman, I seek leave to withdraw my amendment.</p><p>[(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Mr Liang Eng Hwa.&nbsp;</p><h6>5.37 pm</h6><h6><em>Growing Our Economy and Trade</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I seek to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".</p><p>Sir, the Singapore economy surprised on the upsize with a higher-than-expected growth of 4.4% in 2024; significantly above the guided range of 1% to 3% that we came to expect. This is good news for Singapore as it meant more economic activities, better jobs opportunities, more tax revenues to strengthen our fiscal position and better standard of living for all Singaporeans.</p><p>Credit to Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and our economic agencies for managing our economy well to achieve the above-trend growth despite our inherent domestic constraints. The question is: can we do it again in 2025?</p><p>In the latest January release, MTI has again maintained the gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for 2025 as between 1% to 3%.&nbsp;How important is it for us to push for higher growth; beyond the 1% to 3% range?</p><p>Economic growth creates good jobs and helps sustain real wage growth for our people.&nbsp;A more vibrant economy invigorates the business ecosystem and generate business opportunities for the enterprises.&nbsp;In our context, having a strong and growing economy enable us to stay plugged to the global trade and investments flows; and also enable Singapore to stay closely abreast of new developments and advancements in the growth frontiers areas, such as the advance manufacturing, innovations and digital space and so on.</p><p>Having a growing economy also allows us to participate in the global supply chains and enhances our economic resilience.&nbsp;In other words, having a sizeable and growing economy helps us stay relevant internationally.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, over the last decade, many of the regional economics with much bigger scale domestically and have the capacity to grow at faster growth rate, have their size of economy surpassing Singapore; countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand. Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines are not far behind. It imperative that we continue to seek growth; be it a more moderate pace.</p><p>Back to my earlier point whether we can and should grow beyond the 1% to 3%.&nbsp;range, I would say let us always strive to pick up that additional 0.5% to 1% of growth where we can.&nbsp;To do that, it requires us to steadfastly work on overcoming our tight constraints on land and workforce and now also carbon.&nbsp;To create new capacities for higher growth, the hard truth is that we need structural productivity improvements to create new growth capacities. This includes pressing on with enterprise transformations, skills upgrade and continual infrastructural build-up.&nbsp;</p><p>In this Budget and earlier Budgets, a number of support schemes have been introduced and many enhanced. Sir, our circumstance also does not permit us to compete on costs alone.&nbsp;We need to differentiate with our other value propositions, such as the availability of educated and skilled workforce, our world class infrastructure, our premier status as a financial centre, our reputable legal system and our pro-business environment, just to name a few.</p><p>One area of strategic importance and where we can differentiate is to bolster Singapore's position as centre of excellences for technological and innovation developments.&nbsp;It enables us to attract cutting-edge high performing companies to Singapore and to anchor value here.&nbsp;Semiconductors and biomedical sciences are among the high-performing sectors that we should target and to build an ecosystem conducive for its developments.</p><p>In this regard, can I ask what are MTI's plans to grow our research and innovation ecosystem; and, in particular, to support the development of sectors, such as semi-conductors and biomedical sciences?</p><p>Our next bound of economic growth can also come from strengthening our position as a global hub for startups and innovation.&nbsp;Can MTI share how it intends to attract and support high-performing, innovative companies into Singapore?&nbsp;</p><p>Gearing up our enterprises to embrace AI solutions are also necessary enablers to achieve productivity improvements and competitiveness. The Productivity Solutions Grant and SMEs Go Digital schemes already assist enterprises to utilise off-the-shelf solutions for marketing and business analytics.&nbsp;</p><p>In this year's Budget, the support is extended to more customise solutions tailored to the enterprises' needs.&nbsp;The new $150 million Enterprise Compute Initiative brings in major cloud service providers to help companies access and embed AI solutions in their business, including computing power with the help of expert consultancy services.&nbsp;This is a meaningful new initiative and can help companies develop new use cases and commercially viable and creative applications as well. I look forward to more details of this scheme later.</p><p>Can I suggest that besides partnering the cloud service providers, I hope that MTI can also include our local institutions of higher learning (IHLs) and their students to help enterprises develop tailored solutions and commercial use cases.&nbsp;These could be structured as IHLs' industry projects and/or as internship opportunities for the students, so that our IHLs and students are also able to participate in industries' AI developments and to keep their curriculums relevant and updated.</p><p>Sir, the Prime Minister and Finance Minister in his Budget Statement speech said that we now face a new geopolitical contestation that will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. He mentioned that as a small and open economy, Singapore will certainly feel the impact.</p><p>So, can I ask the Minister what are the possible scenarios that Singapore could face and how it will impact us? What could be the worst-case scenario for us? Against this backdrop, of trade and technology decoupling, how would the re-organising of the supply chain impact the future of Singapore's manufacturing sector?&nbsp;How would MTI ensure that manufacturing continues to be a key pillar of our economy?</p><p>Sir, last Friday, the world saw on live TV stunning exchanges between United States (US) President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Zelensky. In that heated exchange, the Ukrainian President was told, \"he has no cards to play\".&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I am not weighing in into that debate, but I am sure it is not a good feeling to be told this by a major power.&nbsp;It is a sobering reminder that, as a country, we must never be caught in a situation where we have no cards to play.</p><p>When Singapore became Independent in 1965, we indeed have very few or have weak cards to play.&nbsp;That is why over the last 60 years, we have been so single-minded and obsessed about strengthening Singapore; whether it is in security, economy, social unity, among others and, importantly, to always be in a strong fiscal position and to have strong reserves.</p><p>This is so that Singapore will always have strong cards to play to defend our national interest and not to be dictated or at the mercy of others. And importantly also, to have the means to mitigate the impact and fallout come what may.&nbsp;In the new, more-contested and technology-driven economic landscape, we again need to re-evaluate our economic competitive positioning and to up the game.</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p>I hope that we will always be bold, as a country, to seek new growth frontiers and continually look to remake and invigorate our economy to stay viable, so that Singapore will always have strong cards to play to survive and to thrive in these extraordinary times.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6><em>Strengthening Trade Relations</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>: Mr Chairman, our economy has long thrived on our ability to remain open, connected and deeply integrated into the global trade networks.</p><p>However, the international order has been weakening. In recent years and, in fact, weeks and days, protectionist measures and escalating geopolitical conflicts across major nations have become the norm. We are at a precarious crossroads as a small, open economy where commerce accounts for over three times our GDP.</p><p>The ongoing US-China trade tensions which have seen both nations imposing trade tariffs against each other will cause supply chain shifts and trickle-down effects on our economy. We have also seen first-hand how conflicts, such as the Russian-Ukraine war, have caused inflationary pressures on the cost of living globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Could the Ministry share the impact of global geopolitical tensions on Singapore's trade relations with other countries and our strategy for navigating this? What strategies will the Ministry utilise to ensure that we can adeptly navigate an increasingly fragmented global economy?</p><p>Concurrently, we remain committed to our resolve to strengthen global trade relations. For example, participation in platforms, such as the ASEAN's Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is vital in our mission to encourage closer regional cooperation. Could the Ministry share our efforts in working with our global neighbours or, in fact, regional ones, to avoid the fragmentation of the global economy?</p><p>Sustained economic success is dependent on our ability to remain nimble, adjusting our trade strategies in tandem with the ever-changing geopolitical landscape. It is hence imperative for us to ensure our trade strategies are resilient and responsive to opportunities and uncertainties to ensure our economic success beyond SG60.</p><h6><em>Impact of Geopolitics and Tariff Plans</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang)</strong>: Sir, global supply chains are being reorganised amid the shifting geopolitical landscape and the emergence of tariff plans. The recently announced US tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China are expected to place significant barriers on trade, increasing tariff costs in the three countries by a whopping $250 billion. Countries have responded with retaliatory tariffs as well as tried to delay and negotiate the way after the rollout. But just yesterday, stocks tumbled, as President Trump announced that he is moving forward with the proposed tariffs, adding that time had run out to reach a deal. More tariffs are expected to be announced in the coming months. Exactly what, it is unclear. But what is clear is that all companies will be affected.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;These, alongside other geopolitical uncertainties like increased protectionism, non-tariff barriers, such as subsidies and export controls, and disruptions caused by climate change, technological changes, among others, as well as changes in security of the world, will make companies reassess their supplier base and their own footprint. For a hub economy like Singapore, the impact on trade and our value proposition and attractiveness as a place for foreign direct investment (FDI) in key sectors like manufacturing, biopharma and the digital economy will be impacted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;What assessment has MTI made of the potential impact scenarios on key sectors like manufacturing and Singapore's overall position as a global hub, and what responses are being planned?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Surviving Geo-economic Uncertainties</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>:&nbsp;The convergence of geopolitical tensions, the US-China trade war, strategic competition in artificial intelligence (AI), and political realignments are reshaping the global economy, supply chains and technological deployment. Singapore, as a small, open economy, is particularly sensitive to these shifts.</p><p>The US-China trade war resulted in increased tariffs on approximately $1.4 trillion in imports. The tariffs have disrupted global supply chains, leading to uncertainty and volatility in markets. The rivalry is so strong that the US and China are willing to risk hurting their own economies, and one can imagine small countries like us can become unfortunate collateral damage.</p><p>Then, there is also the strategic competition in AI, exemplified by China's advancements. Such advancement challenges US technological dominance. This rivalry contributes to geopolitical tensions, influencing global trade policies and economic alliances. I had spoken on this during my Budget Debate speech and will do so again at the Ministry of Digital Development and Information's (MDDI's) Committee of Supply (COS).</p><p>Singapore's economy relies heavily on global trade and investment. Singapore's manufacturing sector accounts for about 20% of our GDP. This sector relies on the seamless flow of raw materials, components and finished goods across borders. Our deep integration with the global supply chain ensured our economic success but can also make us vulnerable. Therefore, changes in external demand, supply chain reorganisation and shifting geoeconomic landscape will certainly have an outsized impact on our economy and, ultimately, livelihoods of Singaporeans.</p><p>As such, considering these macro factors and impact, what are MTI's plans to build resilience into our supply chains and manufacturing sector? How might our manufacturing sector shape up looking ahead?</p><p>One way to build resilience is to ensure that trading partners' interests and ours continue to remain aligned. Put bluntly, to deepen their invested interests in us and ours in them. Now that the multilateral trading system is under pressure, how is MTI working to strengthen our trade links with the region and the world? Can MTI provide more details on how we intend to diversify our trading partners amidst the trade tensions, and how Singapore companies can benefit from these partnerships?</p><h6><em>Growing Our Economy</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, geopolitical tensions, trade policy shifts and technological advancements are driving significant changes in the global trade landscape.</p><p>The concept of reglobalisation is emerging as businesses seek to create more resilient and adaptable supply chains. This involves strategies like nearshoring and friendshoring.</p><p>The US-China trade dispute has significantly impacted global trade as trade between the two countries has decreased.&nbsp;Companies are also diversifying their production capacities to other markets.&nbsp;Apart from tariffs, weather conditions, geopolitical conflicts and cybersecurity concerns have made supply chains increasingly complex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Against this geoeconomic landscape, businesses need to adapt. They need to rethink their sourcing, production and delivery strategies. They are diversifying their supplier base, investing in more stable regions if there is something more stable these days, and adopting innovative strategies to build more resilient and responsive supply chains. This is reshaping Singapore's manufacturing sector. What impact will this have on the future of Singapore's manufacturing sector, and what are MTI's plans to ensure that manufacturing continues to be a key pillar of our economy?</p><h6><em>Global Shifts </em>– <em>Impact on Manufacturing</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee (Nominated Member)</strong>: Chairman, global supply chains are being reorganised amid shifting geoeconomic dynamics, presenting both challenges and opportunities for Singapore.</p><p>Manufacturing remains a cornerstone of our economy, contributing nearly 20% of our GDP and providing over 450,000 good jobs for Singaporeans. As competition for high-value manufacturing investments intensifies, it is critical that we safeguard our position as a leading advanced manufacturing hub.</p><p>What impact will these global shifts have on the future of Singapore's manufacturing sector and how is MTI ensuring that manufacturing remains a key pillar of our economy? Specifically, what measures are in place to strengthen our supply chain resilience, attract high-value investments, and deepen our local talent pipeline to secure good jobs for Singaporeans? Given the increased focus on automation, sustainability and regional diversification, how will Singapore position itself to stay ahead in the evolving global manufacturing landscape?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Saktiandi Supaat, you can take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Strengthening Trade Links</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, since a long time pre-Independence, our geographical centrality has made trade the lifeblood of Singapore's economy.&nbsp;Our 15 bilateral and 12 regional Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are key to our open economy driven by trade in goods and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But the world's multilateral trading system is coming under real pressure. During President Trump's first presidential term, the United States (US) withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.&nbsp;As Trump 2.0 starts this year, the US has already announced a host of tariffs on imports from China, Canada and Mexico.&nbsp;What are the risks of the imposition of specific and reciprocal tariffs by the US on our major trading partners likely to affect Singapore?</p><p>In the current backdrop, how is MTI working to strengthen our trade links with the region and the world? Can MTI elaborate on how we intend to diversify our trading partners amidst the trade tensions, and how Singapore companies can benefit from these partnerships?</p><h6><em>Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone and Supply Chain</em></h6><p>Mr Chairman, the technology and innovation engines mentioned in Budget 2025 hews closely to our manufacturing Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), namely, for precision engineering, energy and chemicals, marine and offshore, aerospace and electronics.&nbsp;</p><p>The announcement of the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (SEZ) agreed between Singapore and Malaysia is an exciting prospect.&nbsp;Covering a range of different economic sectors over nine \"flagship\" areas, the SEZ contemplates centralising manufacturing activities in Pengerang, Pasir Gudang, Tanjung Pelepas, Iskandar Puteri, Sedenak and Senai-Skudai.&nbsp;</p><p>Added to this is the uncertainty of how global supply chains are being restructured, as a result of vulnerabilities that had been exposed by COVID-19, geopolitical tensions in specific regions and changes in the national priorities of particular countries.&nbsp;</p><p>What impact will the Johor-Singapore SEZ and changes to the global supply chains have on the future of Singapore's manufacturing sector and other sectors, and what are MTI's plans to ensure that manufacturing continues to be a key pillar of our economy and also how can we take advantage of opportunities as companies and global companies reallocate their supply chains from other places?</p><h6><em>Planned Obsolescence and Right to Repair</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang)</strong>: Chairman, we should consider having regulations against plan of <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">obsolescence&nbsp;</span>of products to prevent products which are designed with limited lifespan, as they increase waste, consumer costs and environmental damage.&nbsp;We should introduce regulations providing for the right to repair, as such laws can encourage longer product life cycles and reduce waste and carbon footprint.&nbsp;This is especially so as Singapore, with her limited land and resources, can ill afford an unchecked rise in e-waste, or, in fact, any waste.</p><p>The disposal of electronics in landfills result in hazardous pollutants, while the constant need for new products strains our supply chains and increases reliance on raw material extraction. Addressing planned&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">obsolescence</span> and promoting the right to repair are crucial steps towards a secular economy and long-term sustainability.</p><p>Singapore's Extended Producer Responsibility scheme holds producers accountable for e-waste disposal, but it does not cover non-electronic products, which also contribute to carbon emissions. It does not go far enough in tackling planned&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">obsolescence&nbsp;</span>or ensuring consumers can repair their devices. There are no laws penalising manufacturers for intentionally shortening product lifespans, nor do we have regulations guaranteeing access to spare parts or repair manuals.</p><p>Many Singaporeans have experienced the frustration of purchasing an affordable product online, only to have it malfunction within a short time. Without access to spare parts or repair options, consumers are left with no recourse but to dispose of the faulty item and buy a replacement. This not only wastes money but also contributes to unnecessary waste.&nbsp;A right to repair framework would address such common consumer grievances by ensuring that products are repairable and that manufacturers provide the necessary support for maintenance and longevity.</p><p>In France, their anti-waste law includes measures, such as repairability indexes for electronic devices. This index requires manufacturers to assign a repairability score to their products, ranging from one to 10. France also banned intentionally shortening the lifespan of products and imposes heavy fines on companies engaging in planned obsolescence. A phone or vacuum cleaner that lasts four years instead of two would half the electronic waste across time.</p><p>Sweden introduced tax incentive to make the repair of goods more affordable for consumers. Valued-Added Tax (VAT) on repair services for items, such as bicycles, shoes and clothing was halved from 25% to 12%, effectively lowering the cost of these services. Additionally, consumers can claim back from income tax half the labour cost of compliance repairs performed by technicians in their home, up to a certain limit.&nbsp;These measures are designed to make repairing goods more financially attractive than replacing them, thereby extending product lifespan and reducing environmental impact.</p><p>By making repairs more economically viable, there is an increased demand for skilled technicians and repair services, leading to job creation and the growth of small businesses specialising in maintenance and refurbishment.</p><p>By adopting similar right to repair laws, Singapore can enhance consumer rights, reduce electronic waste and foster a more resilient economy. A National Repairability Framework requiring manufacturers to disclose the expected lifespan of their products and provide standardised repairability ratings would greatly enhance consumer protection.</p><h6>6.00 pm</h6><p>Additionally, an independent consumer advocacy body should be set up to monitor and report cases of planned obsolescence, ensuring transparency and accountability. Transparency and access to information are key to empowering consumers to make informed choices. A mandatory repairability rating system prominently displayed on product packaging would enable consumers to compare products based on their expected longevity and ease of repair. This would help consumers avoid purchasing products with artificially short life spans, ultimately leading to more sustainable consumption habits.</p><p>Additionally, public education campaigns can be launched to raise awareness about repair rights and available services, ensuring that consumers are equipped with the knowledge to extend the life of their products. Responsible businesses that already prioritise product quality, longevity and repairability would benefit from increased consumer trust and brand loyalty over businesses that rely on planned obsolescence to drive sales. By fostering a market where durability and sustainability are rewarded, we can shift industry standards towards more ethical and environmental friendly practices.</p><h6><em>Comprehensive Consumer Protection</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Chairman, my cut today is focused on consumer protection for online scams. As to why I am filing this card for MTI instead of other more obviously connected Ministries, this is because I believe that the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore can play a major role in this area.&nbsp;</p><p>At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the work of the different agencies, some around the clock, to prevent, detect, disrupt and respond to online scams. Some of my own residents were saved from losses due to interventions during ongoing transactions.</p><p>However, as consumers continue to lose a record amount of money to scams across a wider range of sectors and to increasingly sophisticated criminals, an overarching body to set and enforce standards and protections for consumers will be desirable over the current sector-specific and somewhat fragmented approach. For example, the Shared Responsibility Framework falls under the purview of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).&nbsp;</p><p>However, as an integrated financial regulator with a focus on prudential oversight and supervision of the financial services sector, it would be difficult to expect the MAS to also protect and enforce consumer rights.&nbsp;Consumer complaints are often directed to channels, such as the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDRec) or the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), but both have limitations, including in enforcement. Further, the current approach also means that solutions like the Shared Responsibility Framework, which is currently limited to phishing scams, only apply to banks and telcos.</p><p>With investment scams and job scams making up 29% and 14% of all scam losses in 2024, the Government will constantly have to play catch up with evolving scam methodologies across various sectors. Consumers need a stronger advocate in their fight against scams.</p><p>Accordingly, I believe that the Competition and Consumer Commission (CCCS) is best placed to take on such a central role with a focus on consumer rights. CCCS is a statutory board and has the power and legal authority to set and enforce national consumer protection standards. Critically, it will be able to protect consumer rights across a range of sectors and be a single point of contact for scam victims seeking redress.</p><p>This has recently been done in Australia with the passage of the Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2025. The Bill established the framework within the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, and under the supervision of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.&nbsp;As noted by the Minister at the Second Reading of that Bill, the legislation operates across a whole range of sectors, including social media platforms, and allows consumers to look at a trusted, centralised point within Government.</p><p>Sir, consumers bear the brunt of online scams and should be at the centre of prevention, detection, recovery and enforcement strategies. Our approach would be strengthened by having a centralised consumer protection agency, like CCCS, set and enforce such standards across a range of sectors.</p><h6><em>E-commerce</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the annual complaints statistics released by CASE showed that e-commerce complaints reached an all-time high in 2024, surpassing even the peak caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>E-commerce has fundamentally changed the way consumers shop, creating new consumer protection concerns and exacerbating existing unfair business practices.</p><p>In my Budget debate speech, I spoke at length about the importance of ensuring that our consumer protection regime and legislation are updated and remain fit-for-purpose in this e-commerce era.&nbsp;What is the Ministry’s plan to tighten and enhance consumer protection for Singaporean consumers, who are increasingly turning to e-commerce?</p><h6><em>Progress Update on IMC and SME Pro-Enterprise Office</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, as a result of feedback from the Alliance for Action on Business Competitiveness, Senior Minister of State Low Yen Ling announced the establishment of the SME Pro-Enterprise Office (PEO) to tackle regulatory challenges and strengthen Singapore’s pro-business environment. In parallel, the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review was formed to ensure that regulations remain agile, business-friendly and aligned with Singapore’s economic competitiveness.</p><p>Can MTI provide an update on the progress of the IMC and the SME PEO, and how these initiatives are working together to streamline processes, reduce compliance costs and ensure that pro-enterprise policies translate into real benefits for SMEs? How will these efforts help Singapore businesses stay competitive amidst rising costs and global headwinds?</p><h6><em>Alliance for Action on Business Competitiveness</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, in February 2024, MTI and the Singapore Business Federation launched a bold collaboration – the Alliance for Action on Business Competitiveness. Over nine months of consultations with more than 100 business leaders, 13 trade associations and 17 public agencies, this alliance produced 27 recommendations to tackle key challenges in manpower, land use and regulatory frameworks. These recommendations serve not merely as proposals but as a roadmap to transform obstacles into opportunities, whether through diversifying our talent pool, extending industrial land lease tenures or streamlining regulatory processes.</p><p>Alongside this, as mentioned earlier, an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Pro-Enterprise Rules Review was established under Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong. This committee is focused on reducing compliance costs and easing regulatory burdens, particularly for SMEs. A key outcome is the launch of the SME Pro-Enterprise Office under Enterprise Singapore, which is being welcomed by all trade associations and SMEs. This one-stop centre promises to be a game-changer by providing direct, hands-on support to businesses navigating complex regulations.</p><p>Mr Chairman, these initiatives underscore our strong commitment to cultivating a vibrant and competitive business environment. I seek an update from MTI on two fronts. First, how is the implementation of the Alliance for Action’s recommendations progressing? What specific measures are in place to ensure their effective and timely execution? Second, how will the SME Pro-Enterprise Office engage with businesses to alleviate regulatory challenges and integrate their feedback to keep our framework agile and responsive?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Easing Regulatory Compliance and Cost</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, regulatory requirements are important for maintaining a stable and trustworthy business environment in Singapore. Hence, to operate a business in Singapore involves compliance with several ongoing regulatory requirements. Depending on the business sector, there may be additional sector-specific mandatory compliance requirements.&nbsp;With businesses, especially smaller businesses, facing increasing business costs, what efforts are being made by the Government to simplify and streamline rules and regulations to reduce compliance costs for businesses?&nbsp;</p><p>The IMC for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review was established in April 2024 to improve regulatory efficiency and to ease compliance burdens, especially for SMEs. MTI also announced the establishment of the SME Pro-Enterprise Office (PEO). Can MTI provide an update on the IMC for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review and the SME PEO?</p><h6><em>Update on SME Pro-Enterprise Office</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, businesses need to continue to manage costs efficiently, especially in a competitive environment. As mentioned by Members previously, can MTI provide an update on the the IMC for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review and the SME Pro-Enterprise Office (PEO).</p><p>Specifically, what are the key areas that have been most helpful for SMEs? What has the feedback from SMEs been so far? Are we seeing positive response by SMEs in accessing the services? Will new SMEs also find the PEO beneficial?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Innovation, Growth and Sustainability</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Singapore’s next phase of economic growth hinges on reinforcing our position as a global hub for startups and innovation. Despite a strong entrepreneurship ecosystem, startups continue to face challenges in securing growth funding, with valuations under pressure and increased dilutions for founders and employees. How will the Long-Term Investment Fund and Private Credit Growth Fund help address these challenges?</p><p>Beyond capital, networks are crucial in scaling enterprises. Strong global networks enable startups and high-growth enterprises to internationalise. How is MTI fostering an ecosystem where personal networks support enterprise scaling?</p><p>As Singapore strengthens its status as a global wealth hub, many high-net-worth individuals possess vast business networks. How is MTI engaging these individuals to deploy patient capital and activate their networks to help local enterprises expand internationally?</p><p>Our commitment to net-zero by 2050 requires decisive action, particularly in decarbonising the power sector. Higher renewable energy costs may impact business competitiveness. Can MTI provide an update on strategies to ensure a sustainable transition while maintaining economic competitiveness?</p><p>Singapore, as a leading financial hub, is well-positioned to shape the carbon trading market. However, transparency and accuracy challenges remain. Given our reputation for trust and competence, how is MTI nurturing a carbon trading ecosystem that leverages on Singapore’s strengths?</p><p>A key aspect of carbon trading is transferring international mitigation outcomes, requiring corresponding adjustments via G-to-G agreements. How is MTI collaborating with regional partners to develop beneficial frameworks?</p><p>Energy efficiency remains a priority. While past Budgets have introduced grants for energy-efficient systems, will MTI enhance these grants to accelerate adoption? Given the high energy consumption of large buildings, will MTI introduce grants for large building owners to drive meaningful energy savings? Specifically, as land intensification in business parks presents an opportunity to deploy district-wide energy solutions, such as district cooling, how is MTI ensuring that these projects incorporate energy efficiency targets at the design stage?</p><p>MTI has introduced several initiatives to enhance the business environment. The Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review and SME Pro-Enterprise Office (PEO) were launched in 2024. Can MTI provide an update on their impact on improving regulatory processes and benefiting businesses?</p><p>Collaboration between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and local businesses is key to scaling globally. The Partnerships for Capability Transformation Scheme fosters such partnerships, but what is the utilisation rate of the scheme relative to its budget? Does the scheme require enhancements to strengthen the complementary relationship between MNEs and local enterprises and support local enterprises to scale globally?&nbsp;</p><p>Personal relationships are critical in business. With the trend of onshoring and MNEs relocating key functions closer to home, how is MTI ensuring that MNE decision-makers remain in Singapore, enriching our business networks?</p><p>For local enterprises to scale, economies of scale are crucial. I propose the existing merger and acquisitions (M&amp;As) support programmes could be expanded to include joint ventures and shared services. Additionally, grant schemes, such as the Enterprise Development Grant and the Productivity Solutions Grant, could be restructured to offer higher grant quantums for joint enterprise development rather than individual efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>Turning to Singapore’s tourism and lifestyle sector. Tourism is a key pillar of Singapore’s economy. Last year, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) announced the Tourism 2040 roadmap. Can MTI provide an update on its progress and future efforts to keep Singapore competitive as a top global destination?</p><p>Singapore’s local arts scene has immense potential to offer unique, authentic experiences for travellers seeking cultural depth. How is MTI working with local arts practitioners to integrate their content into tourism and enhance Singapore’s appeal to repeat visitors?</p><p>At the same time, the nightlife sector has faced significant challenges. Nightlife is not only a lifestyle offering but also a complementary component of Singapore’s broader tourism experience. Does STB view nightlife as an integral part of our tourism strategy? If so, how is it supporting the industry to remain relevant and aligned with evolving consumer preferences?</p><h6>6.15 pm</h6><p>Singapore’s economic resilience depends on fostering innovation, transition to a low-carbon economy, strengthening local enterprises and revitalising tourism. By supporting startups, enhancing business networks, advancing sustainability and promoting tourism, we can cement Singapore's global hub status.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Foo Mee Har, you can take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Attracting Innovative Companies</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>: Chairman, Singapore is home to some of the world's most innovative companies. Over the years, we have built a strong reputation as a trusted, forward-looking hub for technology and enterprise.&nbsp;This is reflected in the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO's) Global Innovation Index, where Singapore ranks fourth globally, behind only Switzerland, Sweden and the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;To solidify our position as a global innovation hub, 2025 Budget introduced key initiatives to attract top entrepreneurial talent, deepen financial markets and drive research-led enterprise growth.&nbsp;These measures will build upon Singapore's strengths as a global startup hub, where a business-friendly environment, world-class infrastructure and commitment to innovation have fostered a thriving deep-tech, fintech and research-driven ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Our startup ecosystem continues to gain global recognition, with Singapore rising from sixteenth position in 2020 to seventh in 2024 in the Global Startup Ecosystem Ranking. However, to sustain this momentum, we must ensure that startups at every stage of growth have the capital needed to scale successfully from Singapore. While we have a thriving early-stage funding ecosystem, high-growth companies often face challenges in securing capital to scale and expand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>&nbsp;</em>I want to ask how will Singapore enhance venture capital participation, attract global investors and build a deeper late-stage financing ecosystem?&nbsp;&nbsp;How will the new $1 billion Private Credit Growth Fund contribute to nurturing high-growth enterprises and keep them anchored in Singapore?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the Global Founder Programme, announced to encourage global founders to anchor and grow ventures in Singapore, is a welcome initiative. However, how will this programme be structured to qualify candidates? More importantly, how do we ensure these founders remain rooted in Singapore for the long term and contribute meaningfully to the broader enterprise ecosystem?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Integration is key. How will we embed them effectively into our economy? We must ensure these global founders choose to scale with Singapore rather than to relocate to larger markets once their ventures take flight.&nbsp;</p><h6><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Research and Innovation Ecosystem</em></h6><p>Chairman,&nbsp;Singapore's commitment to research and development (R&amp;D) has been a cornerstone of our economic strategy, keeping us competitive in an increasingly knowledge-driven global economy. Through our annual budget, we have consistently invested in innovation as a driver of growth, with the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 (RIE2025) plan allocating $28 billion – approximately 1% of GDP – to strengthen our technological and scientific capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;These sustained investments have positioned Singapore as a leader in key high-value sectors, including biotechnology and semi-conductors. Budget 2025 reinforces this commitment by further investing in R&amp;D infrastructure. However, while world-class infrastructure is essential, its full impact depends on a skilled workforce, the ability to commercialise research and strong industry adoption.&nbsp;</p><p>To fully realise the potential of these investments, we must address three critical factors.&nbsp;First, talent development. How will the Government strengthen our talent pipeline to support these R&amp;D facilities?&nbsp;Second, commercialisation. What measures will help translate research breakthroughs into viable industry applications? Third, sectoral growth. How will these facilities drive broader industry development and create opportunities for local enterprises to scale and compete globally?</p><p>&nbsp;Sir, strong R&amp;D support has been central to attracting and retaining MNEs.&nbsp;MNEs have long been a cornerstone of Singapore's economy, driving innovation, investment and job creation. They contribute significantly to GDP, high-value employment, R&amp;D and global trade connectivity. However, we must recognise the growing vulnerabilities associated with MNEs amid the shifting geopolitical dynamics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Rising protectionism, global trade realignments and economic nationalism are prompting some MNEs to reassess their global supply chains, restructure their Asian operations and diversify investments. These factors introduce uncertainties in the long-term business commitments and investment flows, posing challenges to Singapore's role as a strategic hub for global enterprises.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Given these challenges, I ask the Minister: how will Singapore strengthen its value proposition to retain and attract MNEs? What long-term strategies will ensure that we remain a critical global business hub despite shifting geopolitical currents?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Global Hub for Startups and Innovation</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant (Nominated Member)</strong>: Chairman, Sir, strengthening Singapore's position as a global hub for startups and innovation will be key to driving competitiveness and increasing productivity. With increasing global competition, we must continually enhance our startup ecosystem to remain at the forefront of innovation.</p><p>I have three questions for the Minister. First, can MTI share how it intends to attract and support top-tier startups, specifically in deep-tech and sustainability sectors? Second, how will MTI further strengthen funding access, talent attraction and market expansion support to help these companies grow and thrive in Singapore? And lastly, could we consider a regulatory sandbox model, allowing high-growth startups to test innovations under controlled conditions as we have already successfully done in the fintech industry?</p><h6><em>Commercialisation of Intellectual Property</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee (Nominated Member)</strong>: Chairman, Singapore universities and research institutes produce a wealth of intellectual property (IP) in the form of patents, which hold significant potential to drive innovation and economic growth. How can the Ministry work with universities, businesses and other stakeholders to accelerate the commercialisation of these research patents, ensuring that their benefits are retained within our local economy? Specifically, are there plans to enhance existing initiatives or introduce new measures that prioritise local enterprises in acquiring and licensing university patents at accessible rates?&nbsp;</p><p>This would empower Singapore-based companies to leverage homegrown innovation for growth by ensuring that local businesses are the primary beneficiaries of our research investments, we can strengthen our domestic innovation ecosystem and build globally competitive enterprises.</p><h6><em>Support for Internationalisation Efforts</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member)</strong>: Enterprise Singapore has a comprehensive set of schemes to help enterprises in their internationalisation efforts.&nbsp;Amid the uncertain global economic environment including emerging protectionism, what are MTI's plans to ensure the schemes remain relevant in supporting local enterprises with the potential and desire to internationalise and grow?</p><p>From the recent efforts in internationalisation, which sectors have fared well and continue to show scope for more companies to consider? From the recent efforts, have there been useful lessons that may benefit companies contemplating internationalisation given the increasingly crowded local domestic market in sectors, such as retail and food and beverage?&nbsp;Will local lenders look favourably on funding internationalisation for local enterprises?</p><h6><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Internationalisation</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Enterprise Singapore has several schemes to help companies including SMEs in the internationalisation efforts. In Budget 2025, several of the schemes, such as the enhanced Market Readiness Grant, that helps SMEs defray the costs of overseas market promotion, business development and market setup and the Double Tax Deduction for Internationalisation scheme that allows businesses to claim a 200% tax deduction on qualifying market expansion and investment development expenses, have been extended. The Enterprise Financing Scheme has also been enhanced.&nbsp;</p><p>Can MTI share how many companies have utilised these schemes and how successful their internationalisation efforts are? Geopolitical uncertainties and trade tensions will have a significant impact on SMEs as they look to internationalise.&nbsp;The threat of increased tariffs and regulatory compliance will mean higher cost and complexities for SMEs in their internationalisation efforts. Trade disputes will impact market access and cause supply chain disruptions. How will MTI ensure that the schemes remain relevant to support our local enterprises and what can be done to help SMEs mitigate the risks of internationalisation amidst the geopolitical uncertainties and trade tensions?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Mark Lee, you can take your four cuts together.</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee (Nominated Member)</strong>: Chairman,&nbsp;Singapore's economic success has always been built on our ability to connect with the world. As a small market, our businesses must look outward to scale, compete and seize opportunities beyond our shores. Enterprise Singapore provides a comprehensive suite of schemes to support enterprises in their internationalisation efforts, but as global competition intensifies and economic uncertainties persist, we must ensure that our strategies remain agile and responsive.</p><p>How is MTI ensuring that these schemes continue to be relevant and effective in helping local enterprise with the desire and potential to internationalise? Are there plans to enhance support for companies venturing into high-growth markets or navigating new trade barriers? How will we position Singapore businesses to stay competitive globally while ensuring that they have the right resources and networks to succeed abroad?</p><h6><em>Private Credit Growth Fund</em></h6><p>For our local companies to scale and expand globally, access to capital is crucial. The newly announced $1 billion Private Credit Growth Fund is a welcome initiative to provide more financing options for high-growth companies. Could MTI share more details on how this fund will be structured and deployed to best support businesses? Will the Government consider the management of these funds with private sector players? Specifically, what market gap does this fund seek to address and how will it complement existing financing schemes to enable more local enterprises to grow, internationalise and compete on a global stage?</p><h6><em>Facilitating Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;As) as SME Growth Engines</em></h6><p>M&amp;As should be seen as strategic growth engines for SMEs, enabling them to scale, innovate and compete effectively in regional and global markets. However, the high professional fees associated with M&amp;A transactions covering advisory, due diligence and integration, often deter SMEs from pursuing such growth opportunities. Would the Ministry consider introducing a new grant scheme or expanding the Enterprise Development Grant to help SMEs defray these costs, thereby encouraging more firms to explore M&amp;A as a viable growth strategy?</p><p>Beyond financial support, SMEs often struggle with articulating their valuations and long-term potential to potential partners and investors. To address this gap, could the Government collaborate with Trade Associations and Chambers to establish an Enterprise Financing Advisory Centre as a public-private partnership? This centre could guide SMEs through the M&amp;A process, equipping them with the expertise to structure deals effectively, secure suitable financing and maximise synergies post-merger.</p><p>Additionally, workforce transitions remain one of the most complex aspects of any merger, particularly for SMEs with limited HR and change management resources. Would the Government consider enhancing the Career Conversion Programme to provide up to 90% salary support, capped at $7,500 per month, specifically for workers who need to be redeployed post-merger? This would help SMEs retain valuable talent while ensuring that workforce restructuring does not become a barrier to M&amp;A-driven growth.</p><h6>6.30 pm</h6><p>By strengthening financial, advisory and workforce support mechanisms, we can foster an environment where M&amp;A is not just an option for SMEs, but a strategic enabler of growth and transformation.</p><h6><em>Enterprise Compute Initiative</em></h6><p>The Government has introduced various funding measures to support businesses in adopting AI and digitalisation, helping them transform their processes and systems. However, beyond financial support, SMEs often require deeper guidance to fully integrate these technologies into their operations. How are MTI and other agencies ensuring that SMEs can effectively utilise the Enterprise Compute Initiative scheme, particularly in leveraging AI and digital tools to enhance productivity and competitiveness? In particular, how will the $150 million Enterprise Compute Initiative announced at Budget be structured to provide SMEs with the capabilities and technical support they need to accelerate their digital transformation?</p><h6><em>Harnessing AI</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, businesses, especially SMEs can benefit from AI adoption to enhance efficiency by streamlining business processes and reducing the need for manual interventions. AI tools can enable the analysis of vast amounts of data to provide insights to allow businesses to uncover trends and valuable insights to better understand customers, predict market trends, optimise supply chains. This allows for more informed decision-making and operational efficiency. AI can help catalyse innovation and provide competitive advantage by creating new products, services and processes that drive growth and competitiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>But AI adoption can be challenging for SMEs as it can be expensive, and SMEs have limited budgets and lack specialised skills and may not have quality data and large datasets. For businesses to truly reap the benefits of AI solutions, fostering a culture of innovation is essential. It is imperative to rethink and redesign processes and implement new workflows.</p><p>There are many schemes to support businesses to adopt AI. What is the rate of utilisation of these various existing support schemes and adoption of AI by businesses in Singapore. What impact has AI helped to achieve for businesses? For the new Enterprise Compute Initiative announced in Budget 2025, what are the criteria for businesses to be eligible?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Helping SMEs</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Chairman,&nbsp;Enterprise Singapore plays a crucial role in supporting our SMEs through various grants and schemes in their green transition. However, the current reimbursement model creates uncertainty in capital recovery, discouraging SMEs from making much-needed investments in sustainable equipment.</p><p>To improve accessibility, I propose that Enterprise Singapore provide upfront financial support, particularly for vendors who have already cleared the agency’s onboarding criteria. Additionally, by leveraging AI and Government business data, we can proactively prequalify SMEs and invite them to apply for the relevant assistance schemes, thus removing the guesswork and streamlining support.</p><p>Finally, to further drive sustainable investments, Enterprise Singapore can facilitate the leasing of energy-efficient equipment, such as electric cranes and electric generators, so that SMEs can claim these expenses without the burden of outright purchases.</p><h6><em>Supporting Heartland Enterprises</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong>: Chairman, with more than 80% of Singaporeans residing in the heartlands, our heartlands are not just merely residential zones, but the essence of our nation’s identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, we saw the introduction of the Heartland Enterprise Placemaking Grant (HEPG). Since its announcement, it is heartening to know that about 40 heartland merchants have expressed intent to leverage on this scheme as of September 2024. For example, Quan Shui Wet Market received the HEPG. It is a third-generation wet market business that has expanded into a fresh food grocer and now serves over 500 households daily. The company, which currently does not have presence in the east of Singapore, tapped on the scheme to gain exposure and market insights on residents in the east at the Marine Parade’s Easty Breezy Bazaar. It is a success.</p><p>Considering the sheer number of heartland merchants in Singapore, it might seem that 40 expressions of interest for the scheme might need further enhancements. Could the Ministry share how many heartland merchants have successfully secured the HEPG as of date, and what outcomes might be observed in terms of business growth and community engagement for these merchants? Has there also been feedback from stakeholders on how the scheme can be enhanced? Could the Ministry also provide an update on the effectiveness and outreach of its initiatives promoting the vibrancy of heartland businesses?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As we commemorate SG60 this year, let us restate our commitment to ensuring our heartlands remain dynamic, vibrant and reflective of the Singaporean spirit. Singaporeans are ever ready to support local. Hence, we must provide our local businesses with the help they need to enable them to help themselves ensure the viability and sustainability of their trades.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Next Member is not here. Mr Keith Chua.</p><h6><em>Update on Heartland Enterprise Placemaking Grant</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Keith Chua</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, MTI and EnterpriseSG launched the Heartland Enterprise Placemaking Grant in 2024. Could MTI provide an update on the response to this grant from the merchants and how many applications have been received and how many have been approved.</p><p>Based on activities and events organised thus far, how has the response been from residents and the wider community?&nbsp;Have merchants benefited from increased footfall and business growth?</p><p>Key to all business is staying relevant and competitive. The alternatives, such as large malls located in the heartlands, also draw significant footfall.&nbsp;Will there be regular reviews to ensure this scheme achieves the intended outcomes?</p><h6><em>Tourism 2040</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, Sir, the Tourism 2040 roadmap is aimed at setting out Singapore’s long-term strategy to drive quality tourism growth and strengthen our position as a leading global destination. Recent data indicates a positive momentum. Tourism receipts reached S$22.4 billion between January and September 2024, a 10% increase compared to the same period in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned by Minister Chee, <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Changi Airport's upcoming T5 will enhance our capacity to handle up to 50 million additional passengers annually.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Given these developments, could MTI provide an update on the progress of our tourism development efforts? Also, what strategies are in place to refresh our tourism and lifestyle experiences, ensuring Singapore remains an attractive destination amidst growing global competition?</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Usha Chandradas. You can take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member)</strong>: Chairman, my first cut has to do with the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ) and whether specific initiatives have been put in place or will be put in place in order to support the arts community in opportunities overseas. I note that the arts and creative industries have not been expressly included in the 11 identified economic sectors of focus for economic cooperation.&nbsp;</p><p>One immediate area of interest to local artists is that of affordable studio spaces. I have heard of Singapore artists seeking rental spaces in Johor Baru due to high costs in Singapore. In fact, one common refrain in the local art scene is that the artwork produced locally tends to be small in size, simply because artists cannot afford large studio spaces for production.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the JS-SEZ’s goal of enhancing cross-border collaboration, are there plans to facilitate artist-friendly rental agreements, co-working studio spaces, or grant schemes to encourage creative businesses to expand within the zone? Could there also be bilateral initiatives, such as cross-border artist residencies, public art projects, or co-organised arts festivals, to connect Singapore and Malaysian creatives into the larger regional arts ecosystem?&nbsp;These initiatives could well be integrated into the economic sector of tourism which has been identified as an area for potential cooperation between the two countries.</p><p>As we develop the JS-SEZ together with our partners, it is important that arts and culture are not sidelined in favour of purely commercial interests. I hope that MTI can work with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and the arts community to explore ways to leverage this partnership so that we can support artists in securing affordable workspaces and good cross-border creative opportunities. I hope the Ministry can consider these suggestions and provide updates on its plans for Singapore's creative industries in the development of the JS-SEZ.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Future Plans for Music Festivals</em></h6><p>My second cut is on Singapore’s future plans for music festivals. These festivals serve as an important meeting point for musicians, industry professionals, fans and the general public to create meaningful shared experiences and a lasting sense of community. They also offer substantial economic and soft power benefits. This is something that our regional neighbours have managed to successfully harness. Thailand’s Wonderfruit Festival, for instance, has evolved into a globally acclaimed event, attracting international visitors and elevating the country’s cultural prominence.</p><p>There is a widely held impression in the public sphere that the music festival scene in Singapore is far less vibrant than it was some years ago. To be clear, in my use of the term “music festival” I am referring to outdoor music events with a running theme, featuring more than three acts, and fringe activities like food and beverage stalls or artwork displays.&nbsp;</p><p>A Straits Times article in October last year noted that many events, A Straits Times article in October last year noted that many events, such as Baybeats, Mosaic Music Festival and the Singapore International Jazz Festival, all debuted between the 2000s and mid-2010s. However, of all of these festivals, only Baybeats&nbsp;remains. It features mostly niche local and regional acts, as well as free admission. I note that&nbsp;there has been some recent movement in the scene. The Yuewen Music Festival debuted in Singapore in December 2024, and the Sunda Music Festival is scheduled to take place in April this year. This is promising and I have four questions on the Ministry’s future plans.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, has the Ministry performed any assessments on how&nbsp;music festivals can have an&nbsp;impact on tourism and the economy and, if so, what have the results of those studies been? Secondly, is MTI engaging with the local music community to gather feedback on how music festivals can support their needs? Thirdly, has any funding been allocated for the development of these music festivals under the tourism development funds or otherwise? Finally, is there a timeline in place so that the music community&nbsp;and general public can be updated on future developments?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Mark Lee. You can take your two cuts as well.</p><h6><em>Decarbonising the Power Sector</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee</strong>: Chairman, Singapore has set an ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, but we must ensure that our transition to a low-carbon economy does not come at the expense of our competitiveness, especially as Singapore faces intensifying regional competition. Many of our regional peers are also advancing their sustainability agendas, but they are doing so while keeping energy costs low and maintaining a strong industrial base.</p><p>Can MTI provide an update on its measures to transition to a low-carbon economy, particularly in decarbonising the power sector while ensuring that energy remains cost-competitive for businesses? How will Singapore strike the right balance between sustainability and economic viability, ensuring that our industries remain attractive for investment and job creation, even as we push for green transformation?</p><h6><em>Sustainability Reporting and Decarbonisation Roadmap</em></h6><p>For Singapore to move forward, businesses must integrate sustainability into their operations. The Sustainability Reporting Grant and Singapore Emission Factor Registry, launched by SBF, have been instrumental in simplifying sustainability reporting. However, businesses, especially SMEs, continue to face challenges due to the complexity and resource-intensive nature of reporting requirements.</p><p>To further support businesses, would the Government consider developing a national standardised software with data templates to streamline sustainability reporting and reduce compliance burdens? Additionally, SMEs often lack inhouse expertise to navigate sustainability requirements. Could the Government work with trade associations and chambers to develop a step-by-step decarbonisation roadmap, equipping SMEs with clear guidance on sustainability adoption?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Next Member is not here, Ms Tin Pei Ling.</p><h6><em>Low-carbon Economy for Digital Future</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong>:&nbsp;The transition to a low-carbon economy, bolstered energy security and an increased supply of green energy are pivotal to sustaining and advancing our digital economy and aspirations. As digital technologies, particularly AI, become more integrated horizontally and vertically across industries and sectors, the demand for data centres and higher computing power will increase. The consequent demand for energy will also rise exponentially.</p><p>According to the Goldman Sachs Research,&nbsp;global power demand from data centers is&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">projected to increase by 50% by 2027,&nbsp;</span>with a potential rise of up to 165% by 2030 compared to 2023 levels. Such a surge is attributed to the accelerating deployment of AI technologies and proliferation of digital services.&nbsp;</p><h6>6.45 pm</h6><p>Further, training advanced AI models requires substantial computational power, also leading to heightened energy demands. For example, processing a unit of text in Gen AI models can emit a carbon footprint comparable to driving a gasoline-powered vehicle for five to 20 miles.</p><p>Hence, integrating green and clean energy sources into the digital economy is crucial. We will also have to diversity our energy sources to guard against geopolitical uncertainties and ensure our energy security.&nbsp;Thus, can MTI update on its measures to transition Singapore to a low-carbon economy, including the decarbonisation of the power sector?</p><p>How does the Government also intend to leverage our position as a financial hub and robust financial infrastructure to support our transition to a low carbon economy and securing green energy for our future needs? How does the Government plan to more actively participate in the carbon markets and position ourselves as a credible, vibrant, highly liquid and highly connected hub for carbon credit markets? And in doing so, how does the Government see itself partnering private companies, big and small, in achieving these aims?</p><h6><em>Energy and Decarbonisation</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo</strong>: As a small resource constraint country, Singapore imports almost all of our energy needs. Ensuring stable and secure energy sources while transitioning to clean energy is a challenge.</p><p>Singapore is committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Singapore has made significant actions through strategies outlined in Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) and Singapore Green Plan 2030 as well as the implementation of measures, such as the carbon tax and electrification of transport. Can MTI provide an update on the measures to transition to a low carbon economy, including decarbonising the power sector? What trade-offs will Singapore need to consider as we transition?</p><p>In Budget 2025, Prime Minister Wong announced that to meet our growing energy needs and to reduce carbon emissions, Singapore will study the potential of deploying nuclear energy and build capabilities in nuclear energy with a focus on small modular reactors. Can MTI share more details on Singapore's nuclear strategy and plans including safety, reliability and environmental impact of the deployment of nuclear.</p><h6><em>Energy Fund</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Mr Chairman, the Future Energy Fund reinforces our commitment to a low carbon, sustainable and secure energy future. This is more than just a technological investment – it strengthens energy security, economic resilience and environmental responsibility.</p><p>As Singapore explores sustainable energy solutions, small modular reactors have emerged as a potential long-term option for clean and reliable power. Given rapid advancements in small modular reactor technology globally, how will the fund be deployed to assess its feasibility for Singapore?</p><p>What steps are being taken to enhance research, regulatory readiness and talent development? How are we working with international partners to accelerate learning and preparedness? How do we move swiftly from exploration to pilot programs and, ultimately, full-scale deployment?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Saktiandi Supaat. Your two cuts together, please.</p><h6><em>Energy and Decarbonisation Infrastructure</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Mr Chairman, Singapore has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to between 45 and 50 million tonnes by 2035, which will put it on course to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.&nbsp;Can MTI update on its measures to transition to a low carbon economy, including by decarbonising the power sector?</p><p>Part of our strategy is to increase our clean energy imports from four gigawatts to six gigawatts by 2035, which is projected to meet one-third of our energy needs.&nbsp;Following the award of Conditional Approvals for multiple projects to import low carbon electricity from Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and even Australia , can MTI share what infrastructure is required to ensure imported energy sources are seamlessly fed into the Singapore energy grid in future?</p><p>We are also exploring the feasibility of alternatives such as nuclear power&nbsp;or hydrogen power plants.&nbsp;Considering the topped-up Future Energy Fund,&nbsp;what is the impact of decarbonisation on Singaporeans from an energy pricing perspective?</p><h6><em>Liquefied Natural Gas and Hydrogen Strategy</em></h6><p>Mr Chairman, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen play a big part in our energy future. While we continue on our energy transition to low carbon energy, we must also ensure our energy security&nbsp;in the midst of increasing geopolitical tension and increasing electricity consumption year-on-year – with the exception of 2020 when COVID-19 hit.</p><p>Presently, natural gas has been powering around 95% of Singapore's electricity supply&nbsp;while coal, petroleum products and other energy products like biomass and solar supplied the rest.&nbsp;Singapore has also established itself as a leading LNG and bunkering hub in Asia,&nbsp;backed by investments including our LNG plant that can store more than 300,000 cubic metres of LNG.&nbsp;How relevant is LNG for Singapore, in terms of energy security?</p><p>As for hydrogen, besides the construction of hydrogen-ready power plants,&nbsp;can MTI share what are our hydrogen strategy plans and what are the use cases for Singapore over the next five to 10 years?</p><h6>6.50 pm</h6><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry.</p>",
