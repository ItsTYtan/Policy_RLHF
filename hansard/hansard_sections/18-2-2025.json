    "content": "1.32 pm\nMr Speaker\n: I will now move to my next announcement. On 17 February 2022, the Clerk of Parliament had written to the Attorney-General informing him of the Resolution passed by Parliament on 15 February 2022. The Resolution reads as follows:\n“That this Parliament:\n(a) Notes that it appears from the Report of the Committee of Privileges (Paper Parl 13 of 2022) that offences under Part 5 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act may have been committed before the Committee of Privileges; and\n(b) Resolves, under section 21(1)(c) of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act, to refer the conduct of Mr Pritam Singh and Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap before the Committee to the Public Prosecutor.\"\nOn 18 February 2025, I received a letter from the Public Prosecutor informing me of the outcome of the above two referred matters. Firstly, on the matter of Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap, Member for Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC), the Public Prosecutor, having reviewed the totality of the evidence, had decided not to prefer any charges against him for his refusal to answer relevant questions that had been put to him by the Committee of Privileges.\nOn 18 March 2024, the Public Prosecutor issued an advisory to Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap to advise him to familiarise himself with the conduct expected of Members of Parliament under the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act and to refrain from any act that may be in breach of the Act. Mr Muhammad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap had acknowledged the advisory.\nSecondly, two charges were preferred against Mr Pritam Singh, Leader of the Opposition and Member for Aljunied GRC, under section 31(q) of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act, for wilfully making false answers to material questions put to him during examination by the Committee of Privileges.\nOn 17 February 2025, the District Court convicted Mr Pritam Singh of both charges and imposed the maximum fine of $7,000 under section 36(1)(b) of the Act for each of the charges.\nMr Pritam Singh has a right of appeal against his convictions and sentences.\nI will now address the question of Mr Pritam Singh’s seat in Parliament. Members will note that Article 46(2)(e) of the Constitution states that the seat of a Member of Parliament shall become vacant if the Member becomes subject to any disqualifications specified in Article 45.\nArticle 45(1)(e) of the Constitution states that a person shall not be qualified to be a Member of Parliament who has been convicted of an offence by a court of law in Singapore or elsewhere and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year or to a fine of not less than $10,000 and has not received a free pardon.\nThe advice of the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) was sought on the criteria for disqualification in Article 45(1)(e). AGC has advised that the fine of $10,000 specified in Article 45(1)(e) is based on the sentence imposed for a single offence and not the cumulative sentences of two offences.\nIn the circumstances, Mr Pritam Singh retains his seat in Parliament.",

    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "1\nMs Ng Ling Ling\nasked the Minister for Health (a) when will the national digital health app HealthHub extend its current function of appointments management across all three public healthcare clusters to include Healthier SG general practitioner (GP) clinics; and (b) whether the rest of the current functions on HealthHub, such as laboratory report, medical refill, health screening and CHAS balance, can be extended to these GP clinics.\n2\nDr Tan Wu Meng\nasked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry has studied public feedback requesting for a single fully consolidated public sector app for patients to transact with the public healthcare clusters; and (b) whether there is room for improvement in existing platforms, especially for patients receiving care across multiple healthcare clusters.\nThe Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health)\n: Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 1 and 2 in today’s Order Paper?\nMy response will also cover the matters raised in the question by Ms Ng Ling Ling\n1\nwhich is scheduled for a subsequent Sitting.\nMr Speaker\n: Please proceed.\nDr Janil Puthucheary\n: Thank you, Sir. I invite Ms Ng to seek clarifications, if need be. If the question has been addressed, it may not be necessary for the Member to proceed with the Question for a future Sitting.\nSir, HealthHub is our national health app and web portal which allows the public to interact with all three public healthcare clusters. One of its key functions is appointment booking. Through HealthHub, users can schedule cross-cluster appointments with the public healthcare institutions. This feature is also extended to Healthier SG general practitioner (GP) clinics that have opted to participate in the functions of this app. At this stage, we do not think it is appropriate to compel all private GPs to come onto the app. They are  private clinics and they are operating within a market, albeit one that is heavily regulated.\nWe have not received much feedback on the difficulties in making cross-cluster medical appointments. This may be because the public are also familiar with alternative booking channels, such as the call centres of the institutions.\nHealthHub also provides a range of other services to patients such as viewing laboratory reports, health screening results, prescription records and Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) balances. These functions are also extended to participating GP clinics, except the medication refills which only apply to the public healthcare institutions.\nFrom time to time, we will receive suggestions to consolidate the cluster apps under HealthHub. The cluster apps do serve a purpose, in having features customised to their particular facilities and services. These apps also allow the clusters to innovate on user-interaction features, helping them to better connect with and address the unique needs of the patients they serve. On the other hand, there are also advantages to having a consolidated HealthHub. This is an issue that we will continue to explore.\nMr Speaker\n: Ms Ng Ling Ling.\nMs Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio)\n: Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I have two supplementary questions. Sir, I would consider myself quite a savvy HealthHub user, but even with my use of it for the polyclinics and the hospitals especially when I help my parents, I actually needed some help from my GP that I enrolled onto Healthier SG with, on the navigation to find that there is actually a banner on the HealthHub homepage that says \"Healthier SG\" and the click-on says something like \"View Health Plan\". It is through that link that you can go in and make appointments with the GP clinic that you have enrolled with under Healthier SG, instead of the normal quick link to \"Appointments\" that most patients would have used HealthHub to make appointments.\nMy first question is: can the Ministry of Health (MOH) consider using the quick link \"Appointment\" button that a lot of people are very familiar with if they had been using HealthHub to also make appointments with GP clinics that Singaporeans had enrolled with under Healthier SG?\nMy second question is: I think I have a very good GP who goes over and above the extra mile, even when his clinic is very crowded, to explain to me when I ask questions. That took him an extra two to three minutes. I think some of these other GPs are really doing a good job trying to support Healthier SG which MOH is promoting. Will MOH recognise and give some award to encourage these GPs and encourage what we want to see other GPs doing, as we extend Healthier SG in the coming years?\nDr Janil Puthucheary\n: Sir, I thank Ms Ng for her two suggestions. We will consider both and look at them closely. Indeed, we are always looking to see how we can improve the user interface and user experience of our digital products.\nI am glad that she has found a GP that she trusts and is providing her with quality, in-depth care. I think we do need to find ways to reognise and incentivise this type of behaviour from the family physicians that look after all of us.\nMr Speaker\n: Dr Tan.\nDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)\n: Mr Speaker, I want to start by declaring that I work at a public healthcare institution, but I raise this feedback in my Member of Parliament capacity, based on what I have heard from my Clementi residents.\nSir, I have got two follow-up questions for the Senior Minister of State. Firstly, the Senior Minister of State also happens to be the Minister-in-charge of the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech). Can I ask the Senior Minister of State what lessons can we learn from drawing on GovTech's experience to improve the user experience of MOH's apps and the healthcare cluster apps? For example, GovTech has a deep pool of capable staff, some who have even got experience at major international tech firms such as Google.\nSecondly, can I also ask the Senior Minister of State whether MOH has studied having a much more consolidated app, drawing on GovTech experience and GovTech's ease of use? Because I have residents who tell me that apps such as LifeSG and in particular, Parking.sg, are much, much easier to use than the hospital clusters apps, or even HealthHub. So, can I ask the Senior Minister of State along those lines further? Is there a lot of user interface testing done for HealthHub and the hospital apps, and is that user interface testing applied to populations, including the elderly and people who may not be naturally tech savvy? In short, Mr Speaker, seeing through the eyes of our people and not just the eyes of the engineers and coders.\nDr Janil Puthucheary\n: Sir, I thank Dr Tan for his feedback and suggestions. We do recognise that as our population ages, as we have a growing number of people who have long-term health problems and multiple contacts with clinical providers, they may need multiple care settings to address their healthcare needs. And currently, that may mean navigating different apps to manage medical transactions across institutions for themselves and their family members.\nSo, we are looking at ways and how we can improve our digital services. We are indeed learning from the experience across the rest of the digitalisation in the public sector that GovTech and others have been heavily involved in. The teams that are working with the healthcare service providers – we have the Synapxe digital team, we also have got the GovTech teams, as well as private vendors. So, there is a significant amount of experience from the public sector and the private sector, drawing on the lessons of other care and business process transformation and applying that to what happens within the healthcare ecosystem.\nDr Tan made a point about the consolidation of the apps and the user interface. These are, in a way, two distinct issues. The matter of how we provide the digital infrastructure for the clusters to ride on and provide their individual apps at the moment is something that we are studying, as to whether or not there is a need to then consolidate and streamline.\nThis is distinct from the issue of the user interface and the user experience that he mentioned. We do indeed test with a variety of users from all backgrounds. We do indeed want to make sure that the digital services that we offer are accessible to the population and easy to use, so that they can engage in these transactions.\nI take his feedback and we will continue to try our best. And if there are specific suggestions about buttons, banners, transactions, workflows, I would encourage him and other Members to provide us the information and we will certainly find a way to optimise the experience for all our users.",

    "subTitle": null,
    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "3\nMr Yip Hon Weng\nasked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how does the Ministry ensure that the ease of doing business in Singapore is not exploited by companies seeking to bypass US trade restrictions; and (b) whether the Ministry can provide an update on its assessment of the effects of the US chips export control rules on our semi-conductor industry and the broader economy.\n4\nMs Joan Pereira\nasked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry whether there are measures in place to ensure that entities operating in Singapore are compliant with export controls and international laws in order to protect Singapore’s status as a well-respected international business hub.\n5\nAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim\nasked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Ministry is aware that Singapore will be placed under the new US AI export controls' Tier Two status; (b) whether it is a specific foreign policy objective of this Government to secure (i) the National Validated End-User status and (ii) Tier One reclassification under these controls; and (c) what specific technical and regulatory enhancements, if any, have been communicated by US counterparts as prerequisites for such status changes.\n6\nAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim\nasked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry in light of how US agencies have flagged Singapore as a hub for illicit chip transshipments to blacklisted Chinese AI firms (a) whether the Government is able to (i) disclose the foreign policy rationales behind its regulatory stance with regard to re-exports of such chips since 2023 and (ii) detail any or all inter-agency decisions that led to this situation; and (b) how does the Government intend to rectify any damage to Singapore’s credibility and ties with the US arising from such reports.\nThe Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng)\n: Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer oral Question Nos 3 to 6 on today's Order Paper, filed by Members Mr Yip Hon Weng, Ms Joan Pereira and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, together, please?\nMr Speaker\n: Please go ahead.\nDr Tan See Leng\n: These pertain to questions over the United States (US) export controls and Singapore's approach to such measures. My response today will also cover a similar Parliamentary Question that has been filed by Mr Mark Lee\n1\n, that has been scheduled for a subsequent Sitting.\nSingapore is a stable, trusted, reliable and well-connected international business hub. Our economic competitiveness is based on our commitment to the rule of law, zero tolerance for corruption, transparent regulations and an open inclusive business environment. We have painstakingly built up this reputation over time. That is why we take firm and decisive action against individuals and companies that violate our laws. It is the foundation of our competitiveness.\nQuestions have been raised about Nvidia chips that were subject to US export controls. We are scrutinising this issue carefully and will continue to do so. So far, our checks indicate that physical delivery of products sold by Nvidia to Singapore represent less than 1% of Nvidia's overall revenue. These are mainly deployed in Singapore for major enterprises and the Singapore Government. We understand that the remainder of Nvidia's revenue billed to business entities in Singapore did not involve physical shipments into Singapore.\nIf a company in Singapore is engaged in deceptive or dishonest practices to evade export controls that it is subject to, we will investigate and we will take the appropriate action in accordance with Singapore laws. It is in our national interest to secure access to leading edge technology and to maintain the integrity of our business environment.\nWithin Singapore, the transfer and brokering of strategic goods and technology is governed by the Strategic Goods (Control) Act. This is a robust framework that is aligned with major multilateral export control regimes, including those imposed by the United Nations Security Council.\nOutside of these multilateral regimes, countries sometimes impose unilateral export controls on specific items. The US' export controls on advanced semi-conductor chips are one example.\nUnder these rules, the US expects companies to ensure their business transactions adhere to their requirements, including doing the required Know Your Customer (KYC) on the buyers of the advanced semi-conductor chips. While we currently do not have legal obligations to enforce the unilateral export controls of other countries, we expect all companies operating in Singapore to take into account such regulations if they apply to their international business activities. Their international business activities should be conducted transparently.\nWe certainly do not condone businesses deliberately using their association with Singapore to circumvent or violate the export controls of other countries. At the operational level, Singapore Customs works closely with its foreign counterparts, including those from the US to address their concerns and to facilitate their investigations where appropriate and to the extent our law permits.\nIt is important to emphasise that this open, inclusive and transparent regulatory regime applies to all our trading partners.\nSome Members also had questions about the economic impact on Singapore arising from US controls on advanced semi-conductor chips. There is limited impact, in terms of our ability to manufacture and export chips. The US' current technology controls are aimed at a narrow subset of advanced semi-conductor chips, whereas Singapore's semi-conductor industry focuses on producing mature node chips which are used globally in appliances, automotives and industrial equipment.\nHowever, in terms of access to advanced artificial intelligence (AI) compute – for example Nvidia H100 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), the previous US administration had introduced an AI Diffusion Rule in January 2025 aimed at managing access to H100 or equivalent GPUs on a country-level basis. Singapore, like around 150 countries, has been classified as Tier Two. The details of the US AI Diffusion Rule have not yet been finalised by the current US administration, and the US has not communicated any specific requirements as prerequisites for changes to countries' tiering classifications.\nOur objective is to ensure adequate access to AI compute by both local and international companies with operations in Singapore. We will ensure that US-headquartered cloud hyperscalers can continue to operate in Singapore as Universal Verified End Users and also support local companies that wish to apply to be National Verified End Users with access to AI compute.\nIn closing, I wish to assure Members that we will continue to work with companies based in Singapore to facilitate their access to advanced semi-conductor chips and technologies from all the major source countries. We will also continue to engage the US administration to address their concerns.\nMr Speaker\n: Mr Yip Hon Weng.\nMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)\n: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for his response. I declare that I work in a global investment firm based in Singapore. I am glad that the Ministry has emphasised compliance with international trade rules, and that Singapore takes our obligations seriously.\nCould the Minister elaborate on the safeguards in place, to prevent companies from using Singapore as a conduit to bypass US export restrictions, especially in light of heightened US-China trade tensions? And how does the Ministry balance these safeguards with ensuring that we remain an attractable destination for businesses?\nDr Tan See Leng\n: I thank Mr Yip for his supplementary question. Singapore has a robust export control regime and this is underpinned by a comprehensive strategic goods control legislation. The Strategic Goods (Control) Act 2002 and its subsidiary legislation governs and regulates the transfer and brokering of strategic goods and technology.\nSingapore's list of control goods and technologies is aligned with four multilateral export control regimes, namely the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. And as I have alluded to earlier, the enforcement action is undertaken by Singapore Customs.\nI wanted to give a bit more granularity in terms of how we manage the exports. Potential contraventions can include export, transshipment, transit of strategic goods without the requisite permits or providing false or misleading documents or information, incorrect declarations and brokering of strategic goods without a permit or being registered – and with that, criminal penalties can then be enforced.\nHow do we balance working with foreign counterparts? As I have earlier on mentioned in my reply, while we may currently not have legal obligations to enforce unilateral export controls of other countries, which may vary from time to time, companies that are operating in Singapore are expected to take into account such regulations if these apply to their international business activities.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Singapore Customs also have existing arrangements with some foreign counterparts, such as those in the US, to facilitate the investigation of companies of interest. From time to time, when we do get information of allegations and if we are aware of breaches, we will undertake to conduct these investigations ourselves.\nThe approach that we take is systematic and thorough, and we want to continue to emphasise that we have an open, inclusive and transparent regulatory regime and it applies to all of our partners today. I hope that addresses Mr Yip's supplementary question.\nMr Speaker\n: Ms Joan Pereira.\nMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)\n: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have one supplementary question for the Minister. May I know if there are plans to issue any industry guidelines to support firms operating in Singapore to comply with export controls and international sanctions?\nDr Tan See Leng\n: I thank Ms Joan Pereira for her supplementary question. As I have shared earlier on, countries may have export controls from time to time, unilaterally. Where we have been very clear and transparent to companies operating within Singapore is that they are expected to abide by the countries' export controls, and not use Singapore as a country to bypass or circumvent these export controls.\nTo this end, as the hon Member has highlighted, it would not be possible to cover every potential, probable or future export controls that countries may unilaterally impose. But those principles that have guided us through to build us up to where we are a reputable business hub, these principles will continue to be consistent and we will hold true to these principles. From time to time, when these unilateral export controls come to our attention, we will work with the relevant countries to gain clarity, to engage them, as we are actively engaging with the US, our very important partner, to see how we can better manage and better educate the businesses that are based here to make sure that they are able to comply. I hope that gives the Member the reassurance.\nMr Speaker\n: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.\nAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)\n: Sir, I had originally posed my two Parliamentary Questions to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) before they were redirected to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). I understand the motivation behind this redirection, but hopeful that the Minister or a Minister from MFA will be able to respond to questions that call for a more foreign policy approach.\nNotwithstanding Minister Tan's assertions about the physical sales of Nvidia products being only around 1%,\nNvidia's\nlatest filing with the US Securities Exchange Commission states that for the nine months that ended October 2024, the company booked US$91 billion in total revenue, of which a little less than half is domestic; that is, domestic to the US. The next highest source is actually Singapore, with around $7 billion, and it is more than that for China, which includes Hong Kong, at $12 billion. This means that Singapore accounts for around 20% of\nNvidia's\nglobal revenue. [\nPlease refer to \"Personal Explanation\", Official Report, 26 February 2025, Vol 95, Issue 153, Personal Explanation section.\n]\nIt is not unusual for entrepôt hubs like us to book such inflated revenue figures, even if our value-added component is small or negligible, nor is this really about fraud, as the Minister seems to allude to, but actually legitimate accounting practices and rules of origin machinations.\nRegardless, the headline imbalance invites commercial action, like what we have seen. So, if I may enquire if MFA was aware of these imbalances and if so, is it, in its assessment, that facilitating transshipment trade is positive or negative for the national interest from a foreign policy angle? And relatedly, is there a formal mechanism for MFA to review or provide input to MTI's trade decisions that have inevitable foreign policy implications?\nAnd finally, one question directly for MTI, and given that Singapore is now being placed under Tier Two status by the US, what specific steps will the Government take or plan to take to prevent further downgrades of our status, which could jeopardise our AI hub aspirations?\nMr Speaker\n: Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)\n: Mr Speaker, Singapore is a transshipment hub, a vital regional and global headquarters for thousands of international companies. Our trade volume is three times our gross domestic product (GDP), and the range of activities that our companies are engaged in, and not just companies owned by Singapore and Singaporeans, but by global owners of these companies, have a regional and international footprint. So, I am not sure what Assoc Prof Jamus Lim is referring to when he says imbalances.\nThese unique characteristics are par for the course for the unique role that Singapore plays in the global economy. So, for instance, when, as the Member correctly said, Nvidia states in its returns that 22% of sales of chips were booked to entities with operations in Singapore, but my colleague has already explained to the Member only 1% physically came to Singapore and was deployed in data centres here, serving the Government and other major enterprises, including, I should add, hyperscalers. So, there is nothing unusual or unbalanced about that.\nThe nub of the question really is whether Singapore is being used by these enterprises and companies to evade unilateral export controls. And my colleague has very carefully explained to this House that Singapore, by law, through the Strategic Goods Control Act, gives effect to multilateral export control regimes. He referred to the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Australia Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime. Basically, these are focused especially on weapons or weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological threats, and other potentially significant dual-use equipment. And these have force of law and we take our reference from the United Nations Security Council.\nThere are 200 countries in the world. It is possible for 200 countries to promulgate unilateral export measures. We have explained that we are not legally obliged to enforce that unilateral export measures of 200 countries. But we will enforce the multilateral agreed-upon export control regimes.\nHaving said that, it is not in our national interest to be made use of and for companies who, for whatever reasons, are trying perhaps to evade unilateral export control measures that apply to them, to use their association with Singapore – because people know Singapore is a clean, hygienic, transparent and reputable place – we will not allow them to use that association with us to engage in deceptive or evasive measures to avoid unilateral export measures that apply to them.\nThe point is the onus is on that company and we will not countenance evasion, deception, false declarations or even mis-accounting; and that we will act on.\nAnd as and when a trading partner comes to us and says, \"We have concerns\", at that point, we would certainly facilitate investigations or at least, have a deeper look at the data and see whether there is any cause for concern, and we do that in order to protect our own national interest. Specifically for advanced semi-conductor chips. We too have a need for semi-conductors. It is true that we are also part of the global chains that manufacture and export semi-conductors.\nBut those that are currently manufactured in Singapore are not the H100s, the high-end chips which are used for AI. But we need them for our own purposes and we therefore have to monitor the export regimes of the manufacturers of these chips.\nThe Member referred to our Tier Two classification. Well, first of all, they call it the AI Diffusion Rule. It was first published near the tail-end of the Biden Administration. In fact, right now, the rules are up for comments and the situation is still evolving. We are not in Tier One, but we are in Tier Two, in good company with about 150 other countries. I do not want to get into detail about the exact number of chips and whether that currently poses a constraint for us. Needless to say, we will continue to engage the major exporting source of these advanced chips to ensure that we have adequate.\nAnd I am sure Members of this House will also be aware, when dealing with sensitive topics like this, it is not in our national interest to compromise our negotiating positions when it deals with strategic items on this score. So, I hope the Member understands that the situation that has arisen is: one, because of our unique role and indeed our successful performance of this unique, global role; and two, the fact that we are a trusted, reliable and honest player.\nIf you zoom out, beyond chips and export controls, the point is this: Singapore, as a tiny island city-state and a trading hub, we do need to stand in favour of free trade. We do need to play a critical role in global supply chains.\nSecond point, because we are small, we have to subscribe to international law and multilateral rules, and processes and institutions to give effect to multilateral rules. It comes with being small.\nThird point, we always have to seek to be relevant to the world, to be useful to big and middle powers, but we will not be made use of, either by other powers or even by companies pursuing pecuniary interest.\nAnd my final point, in a world which is bifurcating, fracturing or polarising and divided, it is all the more important for us to play it straight, for me to say the same thing in Beijing and Washington, and to be fair. And that is why everything that Minister Tan has said applies to all our trading partners.\nI think I have said enough. And I hope I have reassured the Member and other Members of this House.\nMr Speaker\n: Minister Tan.\nDr Tan See Leng\n: Thank you, Speaker. I want to also address Assoc Prof Lim's point about Nvidia's quarterly revenue, as he shared earlier on.\nI just wanted to put it into very clear perspective for the Member: in the third quarter of 2024, the proportion of Nvidia's quarterly revenue attributed to Singapore is 22%. This reflects the location where Nvidia's customers received the bill; it does not mean that it was shipped here. So, it is independent from the physical location that Nvidia and its customers deliver the goods to.\nLet me share broadly with Members of the House. It is common practice for global entities to centralise the billing for procured goods and services in their hubs, but this is separate from where the products are shipped to. So far, from our checks and the data that we have on hand, it is revealed that in that quarter, less than 1% of Nvidia's overall revenue was physically shipped into Singapore. The remainder of Nvidia's revenue billed to business entities here did not involve physical shipments into Singapore.\nMr Speaker\n: Mr Mark Lee, last supplementary question.\nMr Mark Lee (Nominated Member)\n: I thank the Minister for the very comprehensive reply. The Minister has mentioned that Singapore has been classified as a Tier Two country under the US AI chip export controls. My supplementary question to the Minister is: what are the economic implications of being in Tier Two and does this classification impact Singapore's ability to attract AI chip investments, high-end semi-conductor research and development or even hinder our ambitions to be an AI development hub?\nDr Tan See Leng\n: I thank Mr Lee for his supplementary question. As my esteemed colleague, Minister Vivian, has shared, we are in the broader base of the 150 countries. I think we are in good company.\nAs I have also mentioned in my reply earlier, the US AI Diffusion Rule has not yet been finalised by the current administration; and Minister Vivian has also alluded to the fact that it was released by the Biden Administration in the final days of his administration. Actually, it is on 13 January 2025, just over a month ago. And there is a 120-day comment period, which will end on 13 May 2025. The new administration has not commented on their policy or position towards the rule. So, we are among one of the 150 countries under this Tier Two status.\nWhilst the US categorised 18 countries under Tier One, it did not share specific requirements on the tiering classification nor what requirements are required for a country to be reclassified from Tier Two to Tier One.\nAccess to AI compute is important for our national AI ambitions. As articulated in our National AI Strategy 2.0, we are adopting a multi-prong strategy to enable industry, academia and Government to undertake high-value AI activities. Besides securing access to advanced AI hardware and compute, we will also focus on talent and infrastructure development. We will continue to support companies operating in Singapore to gain access to advanced chips, including those that are under the AI Diffusion Rule.\nPresently, most of the demand for advanced chips amongst our industry players come from US headquartered cloud hyperscalers. These are: Meta, Amazon, Google and so on. We will work with them to apply to be universal verified end users, so as to allow them to transfer a certain quantity of advanced chips to Singapore for their innovation and for their business needs.\nFor the local companies with significant AI compute requirements, they can apply to be the national verified end user. There are two tiers: a universal verified end user and a national verified end user. They can apply for the national verified end user status to receive access to advanced AI chips and we will support our local companies in their application.\nChips that are imported by both universal and national verified end users will not count towards the national cap imposed on Tier Two countries.\nWe are in consultation with industry players in Singapore to gather feedback on the potential impact of the draft rules on their business activities. This will allow us to better consider appropriate measures to support our companies and we are also, as I have said earlier, engaging the US to address their concerns and to also better understand their approach to the AI Diffusion Rule.",

    "subTitle": null,
    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "7\nMs Carrie Tan\nasked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether there are any manpower training programmes tailored for local micro businesses with less than six employees, such as minimarts, to create real business value to the business owners that offset their increased manpower costs incurred by the Progressive Wage Model (PWM); and (b) whether the Ministry will consider targeted PWM exemptions or adjustments for these micro businesses to help alleviate their business costs.\nThe Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower)\n: Mr Speaker, the Government recognises that businesses may be concerned about rising costs, including wage increases under the Progressive Wage Model (PWM).\nPWM uplifts lower-wage workers through sustainable wage increases, as well as career and training progression pathways to raise their value add to employers. Each PWM role comes with a list of training modules endorsed by the sectoral Tripartite Cluster.\nUnder the Workfare Skills Support (WSS), all employers, including micro businesses, who send eligible lower-wage workers for such training may receive absentee payroll of up to 95% of the trainee's basic hourly salary, capped at $13 per hour.\nBesides training their workers, businesses can redesign jobs and transform their business models to improve productivity. For example, they can tap on the National Trades Union Congress' (NTUC's) Company Training Committee (CTC) Grant, which supports businesses by co-funding their transformation projects to raise productivity, to redesign jobs and to improve work prospects.\nTo help employers adjust to PWM wage increases, the Government has introduced the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (PWCS), which co-funds wage increases given to eligible lower-wage workers. Wage increases were co-funded up to 75% in 2022 and 2023, and up to 50% in 2024. For 2025 and 2026, PWCS will co-fund eligible wage increases by 30% and 15% respectively. This helps businesses cope with the impact of improving the wage outcomes of our lower-wage workers over a five-year period.\nMr Speaker, uplifting lower-wage workers is a whole-of-society effort. Beyond improving wage outcomes, we must also ensure that our lower-wage workers continue to be productive in their respective sectors and have meaningful employment through upskilling under PWM. Businesses must also transform and become more productive, such as through better technology and processes. Employers can tap on the Government measures mentioned to support their business transformation, upskill their workers and defray wage increases.\nMr Speaker\n: Ms Carrie Tan.\nMs Carrie Tan (Nee Soon)\n: I thank the Senior Minister of State Zaqy for his answers. I would like to enquire whether in the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM's) design of the workplace, skilling and training programmes, were micro businesses, such as the minimarts and their associations, consulted and involved in understanding what are the kinds of skills that their workers will need that will create real value-add to their businesses?\nAnd while I am appreciative of PWCS, will MOM consider extending micro businesses with a longer timeline of credit subsidies so that they can have a better chance of transforming their businesses into something that is more relevant for the current economy?\nMr Zaqy Mohamad\n: I thank the Member for her questions. On the first question, when it comes to micro businesses and businesses in general affected by PWM and other schemes, there are the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) through which the Ministry of Trade and Industry and Enterprise Singapore are actively engaging many of our micro businesses, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) on how to tap on the Government schemes, whether it is the Productivity Solutions Grant or other schemes that are relevant for them, to enable them to transform and help workers.\nHaving said that, I do understand that not every hawker or retailer may understand the schemes. But rest assured that if they wish to, the SME Centres can support them, if they request such assistance. At the same time, I just want to assure the Member as well that there are schemes, such as the Enabling Employment Credit, which provides support or even defrays the cost of up to 20% of an employee's salary if they are persons with disabilities or others who require help.\nSo, we do have schemes to support, including even the hiring of seniors, for example, because we know many of them are also in some of these micro businesses. Rest assured that help is at hand and overall, the Government provides the PWCS. We understand that with the increase in salary or wages that we hope and want to be an outcome of PWMs, that employers are supported, costs are defrayed. Certainly, this is one way in which the Government, too, wants to support our lower-wage workers through businesses, by giving them meaningful employment.",

    "subTitle": null,
    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "9\nMr Yip Hon Weng\nasked the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to the recent case of wrongfully obtained ComCare payments due to improper declaration of income and assets (a) how does the Ministry comprehensively assess an applicant's financial situation before disbursing funds; (b) whether the Ministry conducts regular follow-up checks on the financial situation of recipients applying for renewal; (c) besides self-declaration, what other verification methods are being employed; and (d) over the past five years, how many similar cases have occurred and have all erroneous disbursements been recovered.\nThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development)\n: Sir, ComCare financial assistance is paid out from the ComCare Fund, which is funded from public monies. As such, it is important that the assistance is only given to those who qualify.\nTo assess an applicant's financial situation, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will, with the applicant's consent, obtain relevant information backend from Government agencies, such as the applicant's employment status, income level and assets owned. For financial information that is not available from other Government agencies, the applicant is required to furnish the supporting documents and make self-declarations, such as the amount of savings an applicant has in all bank accounts in Singapore and overseas.\nFor clients seeking to renew ComCare assistance, a fresh application must be made and an up-to-date declaration is required. ComCare clients are also required to update the Social Service Office (SSO) should their financial situation change while they are receiving ComCare – for example, if they receive proceeds from the sale of an asset.\nIn considering an applicant's savings to determine eligibility for ComCare, MSF takes into account factors, such as contingency savings for emergency expenses and household size. There is no hard threshold and SSOs will exercise flexibility based on each applicants' circumstances and needs. If the savings are substantial, even if it comprised donations from the public, we would expect the applicant to tap on his or her savings first.\nOver the last five years, there were a total of 25 cases where clients wrongfully received ComCare due to inaccurate declarations on their bank account savings. Recovery action has been taken in appropriate cases. If it is assessed that the client's actions are fraudulent, MSF will report the case to the Police for investigation.\nRegardless of whether the case is reported to the Police, we will take steps to recover any erroneous disbursements. MSF takes a serious view on false declarations as ComCare schemes are meant to support those who are in need and have no other sources of support. Clients who hold significant savings do not meet the ComCare eligibility criteria and it would not be fair to use public funds to support those who are able to meet basic living expenses on their own.\nMr Speaker\n: Mr Yip Hon Weng.\nMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)\n: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his response. I have two short supplementary questions. Given the tension between ensuring accessibility and guarding against misuse of funds, could the Ministry explain how it balances the need for swift disbursement of ComCare funds, with the implementation of stringent checks to prevent wrongful claims? And what measures are in place to ensure that legitimate applicants are not inadvertently disadvantaged by these processes.\nMr Eric Chua\n: Sir, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. I will take them together. Sir, the Member is right to describe the process of extending financial assistance as a process of balance – a balance essentially between getting the most appropriate financial assistance, in terms of quantum, to an applicant based on his or her assessed need in the most expedient manner. And on the other end, maintaining a healthy level of prudence and at the same time, accountability, because public funds are being used.\nOur officers at the frontline, at the SSOs are well aware that, over time, the applicants' financial situation might change and therefore, will check in periodically with each applicant over time; and at the same time, ensuring that the principles of expedience and accountability are upheld. I am confident that our public officers at the SSOs do the best for each application that they receive, based on these principles.",

For example, for cases of public urination, in the absence of factors indicating criminal conduct, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will investigate and take action. Offenders are liable under the Environmental Public Health (Public Cleansing) Regulations to a maximum fine of $1,000 for the first conviction.\nThe Police may investigate such cases if a criminal offence is disclosed. This requires a case-by-case assessment of the nature and circumstances of the conduct in question. For example, an offence of Public Nuisance may be made out if the offender's act causes any injury, danger or annoyance to the public.\nDeterring anti-social behaviour requires a whole-of-society approach, with the Government playing a part through education and enforcement.

    "subTitle": null,
    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "11\nMr Ang Wei Neng\nasked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider according priority to owners of segmented HDB units that do not have direct access to lifts on the same level and where Lift Upgrading Programme is not feasible, when they apply for BTO flats with direct lift access, especially when they have household members with mobility issues.\n12\nMs Ng Ling Ling\nasked the Minister for National Development for HDB units ineligible for the Lift Upgrading Programme and lacking direct lift access (a) what alternatives, besides the Lift Access Housing Grant (LHG), are available to senior residents with mobility issues who face difficulties moving out of such units due to inability to afford a resale flat and their lowered chances in securing new HDB flats as second-timers; and (b) what is the proportion of units whose residents have tapped on LHG versus the total number of these units in the last three years.\nThe Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee)\n: Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 11 and 12 together?\nMr Speaker\n: Go ahead.\nMr Desmond Lee\n: Thank you, Sir. Mr Speaker, households facing extenuating circumstances arising from medical or mobility challenges may tap on the Lift Access Housing Grant (LHG) of up to $30,000, to help them move to a new or resale flat with direct lift access.\nFor seniors with mobility difficulties who face financial difficulties, they can consider purchasing a Community Care Apartment or a 2-room Flexi flat on a shorter lease. Eligible applicants enjoy priority under the Senior Priority Scheme, including those who have already bought two subsidised flats in the past. In the last five years, second- and nth-timer seniors who booked 2-room Flexi flats or Community Care Apartments were able to do so within two tries on average.\nIn addition to the LHG, of up to $30,000 for families and $15,000 for singles, seniors who right-size to a 3-room or smaller Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat and top up the proceeds from the sale of their existing property into their Central Provident Fund (CPF) Retirement Account, can additionally benefit from the Silver Housing Bonus of up to $30,000. This will help them to secure a suitable flat to meet their mobility needs and benefit from additional cash for retirement.\nSince the implementation of LHG in 2020, HDB has received 67 complete applications. Of these, 51 applications were approved, while nine are currently under evaluation. Successful applicants can use the LHG to buy a flat directly from HDB, which includes a 2-room Flexi flat on a shorter lease or a Community Care Apartment or a flat from the resale market, depending on their budget and needs.\nI encourage households with pressing accessibility needs to approach HDB for assistance, so that HDB can better understand their needs and explore suitable options with them.\nOn Mr Ang's suggestion, I thank him for it and will consider his ideas, together with those of other Members', as we continually review our schemes to help seniors and others with mobility challenges access their homes.\nMr Speaker\n: Mr Ang.\nMr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast)\n: Thank you, Speaker, Sir. I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. I want to ask a supplementary question. Sir, how many units of segmented units are there in Singapore? It was answered in Parliament that about less than hundred blocks still have segmented units. So, in Nanyang alone, there are 224 units in 14 blocks that have no direct lift access on the same level. When these original owners bought their flats about 30 years ago, they had really treasured the privacy over having lift access; but today, when they are old, they really treasure the direct lift access possibility over the privacy that they are used to have.\nBut when they want to sell the flat, they have two problems: one is that resale values of these segmented flats are lower; and two, they take a longer time to sell. And what is most important is that when they try to apply for another Build-To-Order (BTO) flat that has lift access, they are considered as second-timers and they have very little success in getting a flat. For example, one of my residents told me he has balloted for three times and could not get a BTO flat that has direct lift access. So, I really urge the Minister to consider giving them priority, especially to those owners who have family members with mobility issues.\nMr Desmond Lee\n: Sir, I do not have the exact number of segmented units without lift access on hand, maybe the Member can file a separate Parliamentary Question.\nBut when the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) first started in 2001, we had some 5,300 HDB blocks without full lift access. Today, almost all, in excess of 5,000 blocks of flats, have undergone LUP, with some 140 blocks left that have not undergone LUP. And so we will continue to find technical ways, including new tactical methods, to try to help these residents. But we will also continue to refine the scheme, as I assured the Member earlier.\nMr Speaker\n: Ms Ng Ling Ling.\nMs Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio)\n: Thank you, Speaker, and I thank the Minister for sharing about the comprehensive efforts of the HDB to try and help residents who are in this segment. I have a group of residents with this issue. I have about 10 out of 142 blocks that are under the care of Jalan Kayu, that have got the lift access issue, so it is less than 10%.\nIn the last five years, in every house visit to them, I have explained HDB schemes, including the LHG to each of these residents. But five years since, none have actually used the grants and they are getting older and older each year. And so, as I distil the reasons why they are not moving off, it all comes to the core reason that they want to age in place, in a flat that they have bought about 30 years ago to set up their family, to raise their family, and it is a very important place of memories for them. They can afford to stay in the flat continually, except for the lack of lift access.\nSo, I have three supplementary questions. One is, when was the last time a technical and cost assessment was done for building lift direct access in such blocks? And two, are there grounds to justify a higher subsidy for these blocks that are stuck with this problem? Because I understand that the quantum for a potential lift upgrade is many, many times compared to the usual flats, and thus, the co-payment for the residents is also very hefty, and that is one of the reasons why HDB is also hesitant to do that. But my question is, if we have a year of Budget surplus, is it something that we can consider, that is, a higher subsidy, so that the co-payment is affordable, like other units with LUP?\nMy last question is, some of my younger grassroots volunteers have been very innovative in thinking of unconventional ways of solving some problems – not for all the blocks, but for one or two blocks, they have pointed out to me a possible way of granting the lift access without having to build a lift for every floor. And my question is whether HDB has an innovation team that a grassroots advisor, like me, can work with, to explore different options besides building that lift access? So, these are my three questions.\nMr Desmond Lee\n: I thank the Member for speaking up for her residents. Indeed, my colleagues at HDB continue to find ways, both technical as well as programmatic enhancements, like the LHG, to help residents with mobility difficulties and for whom lift access is important. I would encourage the Member to refer her residents to my colleagues at the HDB branch office, who will work with each family individually to understand their needs and concerns, and to try to find ways to better help them.\nIndeed, again, if the Member has got volunteers or residents with good technical ideas, we welcome them to approach us, to share them with my colleagues and we will study them carefully.\nBut I would just assure the Member that over the years, as the number of blocks that have not undergone LUP get smaller and smaller, my colleagues continue to find different ways, both lift as well as non-lift solutions, to try to bring lift access to those blocks, but for the remaining 140 blocks, some of them face significant technical challenges. Some of them require a significant cost, well beyond what is provided to all the other households to get the lift – sometimes in excess of well over $100,000 per unit even. But we continue to find effective ways to try to help these families.\nFor instance, for some blocks of flats in the past, we could not do a lift because there were height restrictions, because they were in areas near flight path. And so we put in machine roomless lifts, in order to address the needs of the residents there. For some blocks, we had some smaller lifts to be able to provide a cost effective and meaningful solution for these residents.\nWe have also tried things, like vertical platform lifts and pneumatic vacuum elevators. We experimented with them in non-residential blocks. But in 2017, after trying a pilot for these different methods, we decided not to proceed because they were not effective. We also tried long bridges, some of these might end up requiring access through residents' balconies. But we have been prepared to try those in order to give lift access. There were also half-landing solutions. We have also experimented with wheelchair lifters and portable stair climbers, some of which residents have tried and they felt very uncomfortable with it. But we continue to try, do hackathons and try to find new ways, work with research agencies to try to find solutions for residents.\nWe will continue to work on this, but as I have said earlier, if there are specific residents with pressing mobility needs, whether arising from health or other causes, please refer them to us.\nMr Speaker\n: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.\nMr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang)\n: Sir, I just want to further ask the Minister: there could be blocks where it is segmented and some parts of the blocks are suitable for lift upgrading constructions, to put in the lift shaft – but some parts of the blocks are not. My first supplementary question to the Minister is whether HDB would still go ahead if enough units within the block can get lift access, even though there are some units that cannot? Would HDB still go ahead with that?\nMy second supplementary question is, at the end of the day we are left with 140 blocks. Is HDB prepared to move the subsidy funding more, just so that more of the remaining blocks can get qualified for the LUP? So, if it is a funding problem, can we look at adjusting the funding subsidies?\nMr Desmond Lee\n: On the Member's first question, I invite him to approach HDB, if he has certain blocks that are partly segmented and partly not, and he thinks that he would like to go ahead. We can study it very carefully to see whether we proceed to offer LUP for those blocks.\nOn the issue of funding, we look at what is cost effective. We lean in favour of trying to help residents with access where possible. And that is why out of 5,300 blocks at the start of the exercise in 2001, we now have 140; and we continue to try to find ways to help.",

    "content": "13\nMs See Jinli Jean\nasked the Minister for Education in view of the Labour Force in Singapore 2024 report which states that more unemployed non-trainees did not know what skills to pick up or improve on to stay relevant to job demands (a) whether motivating and equipping more employers to pivot to skills-based hiring can help increase overall training intensity; (b) if so, how will the Ministry do so; and (c) how will the Government translate such efforts into placement outcomes for industries like information and communications where the unemployment rate has risen.\nThe Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education)\n: Mr Speaker, individuals who are unsure of which skills to invest in can refer to the online jobs-skills insights, resources and tools on the Jobs-Skills Portal developed by the SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech). Those who prefer one-to-one consultation can visit Workforce Singapore’s (WSG’s) or e2i's career centres to find out what career options best match their interests and skills and also engage SSG’s Skills Ambassadors for personalised course recommendations.\nEmployers can certainly create greater confidence for individuals to pursue industry-relevant training by adopting skills-based hiring practices. These practices include identifying their skills needs, articulating them clearly in the job requirements and also recognising individuals' skills and competencies attained rather than relying only on credentials and qualifications alone. It is in employers' interest to do so because they will benefit from having access to a wider talent pool.\nTo further encourage employers to adopt skills-based hiring, the Ministry of Manpower, WSG and SSG have launched the Career Health SG. This initiative equips employers with tools and resources, including those developed by the Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP) to practise skills-first hiring and develop their workforce.\nIn addition, SSG works closely with industry intermediaries to strengthen sectoral skills development pathways. For example, the Singapore Computer Society, one of SSG's Skills Development Partners, launched the Skills Pathway for Cybersecurity last year, presenting a clearer career roadmap for individuals to enter the cybersecurity field or for existing cybersecurity professionals to upskill. It brings together key employers in the sector to recognise the professional skills that individuals need to obtain to be considered for interviews and internships, and this can improve their employability too.\nMr Speaker\n: Ms Jean See.\nMs See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member)\n: I thank the Minister of State for her answer. Just wanted to ask: what are the roadblocks that the Ministry envisages in pushing forward skills-first hiring? And which sectors would the Ministry consider making greater traction and also leading the effort in redefining and reframing the way that we look at employment?\nMs Gan Siow Huang\n: First of all, we recognise that we can do more to reach out to people who are unemployed. I think this is in the context of Ms Jean See's question – reaching out to them so that they know the resources that are available that they can tap on. Secondly, for employers, supporting employers and helping them to understand how their companies can benefit from skills-based hiring.\nWe do not have specific preferred sectors to develop this, but certainly we are very happy to work with our tripartite partners, including the Singapore National Employers' Federation, the National Trades Union Congress, the trade associations and chambers, and the Singapore Business Federation to help engage employers and companies out there.\nAnother important partner would be IHRP, the HR professionals. We think that by strengthening their competency in applying skills-based hiring and employment practices, we can take the step further in promoting skills-based hiring in Singapore.",

    "content": "14\nMs Carrie Tan\nasked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Minister will consider developing and co-creating transformation and funding schemes for neighbourhood shops such as minimarts to provide employment and workplace incubation opportunities to vulnerable segments of society such as persons with special needs or persons with disabilities.\nThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development)\n: Sir, the Government supports businesses of all sizes, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in inclusive hiring.\nUnder the Open Door Programme, administered by SG Enable, persons with disabilities and employers receive up to one year of job matching and customised employment support from trained job coaches. Employers can tap on the Job Redesign Grant to redesign jobs, purchase new equipment or modify the workplace to be more conducive for their employees with disabilities. These schemes are open to employers in neighbourhood shops.\nIn addition, under the Inclusive Business Programme run by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and SG Enable, businesses that commit to having at least 20% of their hired workforce made up of persons with disabilities can be directly allocated HDB shop spaces. SMEs enjoy a 30% rental discount for their first three years of tenancy, with an option to renew for another three years.\nSG Enable reaches out to such neighbourhood shops to promote these schemes. For example, its Enabling Business Hub at Jurong has engaged the Federation of Merchants’ Associations Singapore and Taman Jurong Hawkers’ Association to promote inclusive hiring of persons with disabilities in the community.\nMr Speaker\n: Ms Tan.\nMs Carrie Tan (Nee Soon)\n: Thank you, Speaker. I would like to thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his reply. May I clarify if he was taking both Question Nos 14 and 15 together, or only Question No 14?\nMr Eric Chua\n: Just one.\nMs Carrie Tan\n: Just Question No 14, okay. I would like to find out whether there can be a systematic programme, given that there are already 712 minimarts that are currently operating under the HDB leases island-wide. As the Senior Parliamentary Secretary recognised, this is a great opportunity where there can be location- and proximity-based opportunities for persons with special needs and disabilities to be employed within and near to their own places of residence. So, while there is this Open Door Programme, is the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) willing to consider a more concerted and systematic effort and programme, specifically catered for minimarts to pivot into a social enterprise or social enterprises to offer employment to persons with disabilities (PwDs) and persons with special needs (PWSNs) within their specific locality and neighbourhoods?\nMr Eric Chua\n: Sir, actually, there is a concerted and coordinated plan as recommended by the Enabling Master Plan Task Force for promoting inclusive employment practices. Some of the key components of our strategies to raise the bar in inclusive employment include: one, harvesting the potential for more inclusive hires in six identified growth sectors by enhancing support for employers in companies in these sectors, including putting in place inclusive hiring champions; two, improving opportunities for PwDs in gig work; and three, uplifting the capabilities of our job coaches.\nBut to the Member's suggestion, we are prepared to look at what the Enabling Business Hub is currently doing, working with the hawkers' associations, as well as the local community, local heartlands, business owners, and scale what has been done, where appropriate.",

For example, community partners are involved in providing cooked meals, dry rations and perishables to eligible clients. Some are run in partnership with hawker stall owners and local merchants, and offer lower prices due to support from donors.\nThese efforts complement Government efforts such as the Ministry of Health's Meals-on-Wheels service which provides subsidised meal deliveries to eligible homebound clients. The Ministry of Social and Family Development has also appointed vendors to ensure that our clients on Long-Term Assistance receive the supplies they need to meet their specific needs. These includes items such as adult diapers and milk feed.\nWe welcome such community efforts as part of the broader social compact, where those who have done well do their part to uplift those in need.",

I was wondering whether MSE has got feedback about the Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers from merchants and hawkers, and whether it is a multiplier effect to generate business in the heartlands? And if so, would they support the additional provision of CDC Vouchers from your Ministry's point of view?\nDr Koh Poh Koon\n: Sir, I thank the Member for his question. The CDC Voucher Scheme is not administered by my Ministry. But just from anecdotal experience, even from within my own constituency, I do see that quite a number of residents spend their vouchers at many of our hawker stalls. By looking at the spending patterns, we know which hawker stalls are a lot more popular with residents as well, because they spend a lot more of their vouchers at these hawker stalls.\nSo, I would say if I can extrapolate from that simple experience, I would think that the CDC Voucher Scheme does have an impact on bringing financial support to these hawkers through the spending patterns of our residents. And I am sure at the Budget, more may be announced.",

    "title": "Further Measures to Ensure Affordability of Preschool Education",
    "subTitle": "Survey finds household expenditure on preschool education increased to $1.3 billion in 2023",
    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "18\nDr Wan Rizal\nasked the Minister for Social and Family Development with reference to the latest Government survey on household expenditure stating that preschool education spending increased from $1 billion in 2018 to $1.3 billion in 2023 (a) what steps are implemented to further alleviate the financial burden on families, especially for middle-income households who may not qualify for the highest subsidies; (b) how effective have recent fee cap reductions in preschool fees improve affordability; and (c) whether there are plans to enhance subsidies or expand access to Government-supported preschools.\nThe Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development)\n: The increase in household expenditure on pre-primary education corresponds to: one, an overall increase in enrolment of children in preschools; and two, more parents enrolling their children in full-day childcare over half-day kindergarten.\nThe expenditure statistics quoted by the member are nominal figures, so part of the increase is due to inflation during this period.\nFrom 2018 to 2023, the total number of resident children enrolled in childcare centres and kindergartens increased from 157,900 to 167,700. The number of children enrolled in childcare centres typically offering full-day programmes increased from 110,200 to 145,400, whereas the number of children enroled in kindergartens typically offering half-day programmes decreased from 47,700 to 22,300. Since full-day childcare generally costs more than half-day kindergarten, this would likely have contributed to higher overall expenditure on pre-primary education.\nThe Government has made it a priority to enhance the affordability of childcare services through various ways. All Singapore Citizen children can receive up to $300 basic subsidy regardless of their families’ income level. Families who qualify for additional subsidy receive additional subsidies of $80 to $467 depending on their income tier.\nIn 2020, we raised the household income ceiling for additional subsidy from $7,500 to $12,000, and increased the quantum across all eligible income tiers so that more families could benefit from subsidies.\nWe also impose fee caps on Anchor Operators (AOP) and Partner Operators (POP), and we have progressively reduced fee caps over the years. Fees for full-day childcare for AOP centres have fallen from $720 in 2022 to $640 in 2025. Fees for POP centres have fallen from $760 in 2022 to $680 in 2025. We will make a further reduction to AOP and POP preschool fee caps next year.\nAs a result of the fee caps, the industry median childcare fee before the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has come down from $800 in 2018 to $720 in 2023. With fee cap reductions and the aforementioned subsidy enhancements, a median-income household with a child attending full-day childcare in an AOP centre spent 3.1% of their household income on preschool in 2023 compared to 4.9% in 2018.",

    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "19\nMr Chua Kheng Wee Louis\nasked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the latest available number of infant and childcare places; and (b) what is the current ratio of infant and childcare places to resident children below seven years old, as broken down by planning areas.\nThe Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development)\n: As at end-2024, there were around 16,000 infant care places, out of which around 70% were taken up. As at end-2024, there were around 200,000 childcare places, out of which around 77% were taken up.\nWhen it comes to utilisation rates, they vary across Planning Areas and the median utilisation rates for infant care and childcare are 69% and 74% respectively. Utilisation rates for all Planning Areas are below 90%, for both infant care and childcare.\nMr Speaker\n: Mr Chua.\nMr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang)\n: Thank you, Speaker. Just one supplementary question for the Minister of State. I understand the average utilisation and take-up. But for places where there is a relatively higher proportion of younger residents such as in Sengkang and Punggol, I think the utilisation will be rather high. I also understand, at least based on the centres set to open in 2025, that a lot of them are naturally in some of these new towns. So, how is this ratio going to change with the introduction of additional new childcare places in the next five years that the Ministry has announced? Especially if you look at Sengkang, based on a quick check on the Life SG app, if I look at infant care places within one kilometre of Sengkang Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station, for example, a large percentage of those are full or have limited vacancies.\nMs Sun Xueling\n: I thank the Member for his supplementary question. For Sengkang, specifically, infant care and childcare utilisation rates are at 74% and 83% respectively. This is higher than the national level infant care and childcare utilisation rates of around 70% and 77% respectively, which I had mentioned in my main reply. Therefore, it is important, when it comes to building the infant care and childcare centres, that there are early discussions between the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and the Housing and Development Board (HDB) to understand where are the new estates that are coming up.\nThese discussions have been taking place. ECDA would assess the sites that are available. HDB gives them a heads-up so that they are able to assess the void deck space that is available or where there are adjacent places available, to be able to construct a space that can be used for infant care and childcare centres.\nThere will be a tender process for operators to come in to operate these centres. That also takes place in advance so that by the time residents move in to these new estates and they have started renovating, this would be in tandem with when the renovations for these infant care and childcare centres take place, so that when the residents come in and they have young children, that these infant care and childcare centres can be used.\nMr Speaker\n: We have one last question to be answered. Mr Yip Hon Weng, please move the next question.",

    "content": "20\nMr Yip Hon Weng\nasked the Minister for Digital Development and Information (a) how does the Ministry plan to ensure the effective implementation of age verification and restriction measures by app stores so that only age-appropriate apps are accessible to children given that children may download apps through their parents' user accounts; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider mandating more robust age verification methods such as facial recognition technology, to prevent children from bypassing age restrictions using their parents' passwords or biometric data.\nThe Minister of State for Digital Development and Information (Ms Rahayu Mahzam) (for the Minister for Digital Development and Information)\n: Mr Speaker, the Code of Practice for Online Safety for App Distribution Services published by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) will take effect on 31 March 2025. It aims to reduce the risk of exposure to harmful content for users, especially young users, on apps.\nTo achieve its objective, the Code requires designated app stores to put in place age assurance measures to prevent young users from accessing age-inappropriate apps. Age estimation through the use of facial estimation technology is one of the measures which designated app stores can choose to implement to meet the requirements. However, the Code does not prescribe specific methods or technologies. The designated app stores can decide what works best for them, as long as the online safety outcomes are met.\nIMDA will continue to engage these app stores over the next few months on their implementation plans. For a start, they are minimally expected to be able to ascertain users under 18 and prevent them from accessing their highest age-rated apps, for example, 18+. IMDA will assess if the plans meet the requirements under the Code.\nRegulations alone are unlikely to prevent a parent or any adult from helping a child circumvent the age assurance measures. It is also important to educate parents on their important role in keeping children safe online. To this end, the Government has put in place public education efforts to equip parents with the knowledge and skills to guide their children’s digital journey and safeguard them against risks online. As an example, the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Social and Family Development and Health Promotion Board launched the Parenting for Wellness initiative in September 2024, which covers resources on various topics such as managing screen use and addressing cyberbullying. Parents can also visit the IMDA’s Digital for Life portal for bite-sized strategies on safe and responsible use of digital technologies.\nWe will continue to work closely with the industry on the age assurance requirements and implementation as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance online safety in Singapore.\n3.07 pm\nMr Speaker\n: Mr Yip, I am sorry, but we are out of time.

    "content": "Mr Speaker\n: Order. The Clerk will now proceed to read the Notice of Motion.\n3.30 pm\nThe Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong)\n: Before I begin, Mr Speaker, I should mention that I am a little under the weather. My voice may not sound like its normal voice, a little raspier. But I will do my best to get through the speech in one go, without a break.\nMr Speaker\n: If you do need a break, just let me know.\nMr Lawrence Wong\n: Thank you, Sir. Mr Speaker, I move, \"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the Financial Year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026.\"\nSir, 2025 marks our 60th year of Independence. It has been a remarkable journey, reflecting the grit and resilience of generations of Singaporeans in building our nation.\nSixty years ago, the world was very different. It was the height of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall standing as a stark symbol of division between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union. In Asia, the Cold War spilled over into proxy fights, with devastating wars in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\nAs a fledgling nation, Singapore faced monumental challenges. Racial tensions were high. Unemployment was rampant. The withdrawal of British forces shortly after Independence dealt a heavy blow to our defence and our economy. In a world divided by blocs, we had no hinterland and no natural allies. Survival seemed improbable.\nYet in that crucible of fire, our pioneers forged a nation. We refused to be pawns in someone else’s game. We turned our vulnerabilities into strength. We plugged into the world as an open and neutral hub for commerce and diplomacy. Together, we defined our relevance to the world and built this nation.\nToday, we face a new global contest. The stark divides of the Cold War have given way to a fragmented and troubled world. New walls are being erected – not of concrete, but in the form of economic and trade barriers. And once again, we will have to find ways to navigate a turbulent external environment.\nWe have done well so far. We bounced back strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic and ended last year on a strong footing. Our economy grew by 4.4%. Inflation continued to ease. Singaporeans saw wage increases that outpaced inflation – the median income of resident workers rose by 3.4% above inflation. Income inequality, after government taxes and transfers, is at its lowest since 2000.\nAll this has given us good momentum for our next phase. But we expect greater global uncertainty and downside risks. The US and China are locked in a fierce contest for global supremacy. Neither side wants to come to blows. But both know that economic heft and technological prowess are key to winning this global race. And both are prepared to take more assertive actions to advance their own interests, even at the expense of established international norms.\nSo, we can expect escalating attempts at containment and counter-containment, with ripple effects that will inevitably draw in other countries, including Singapore. All these pressures will reshape the global economy and dampen prospects for global growth. As a small and open economy, we will feel the impact.\nFor 2025, we expect a more moderate outlook. Growth is projected at 1% to 3%, while inflation is expected to average 1.5% to 2.5%.\nBut despite the uncertainties, we can look ahead with a degree of confidence. Singapore today is far stronger than we were 60 years ago. We have developed a strong and well-diversified economy, supported by a highly skilled workforce. We have built up a robust Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and a strong diplomatic network, to uphold our sovereignty and security. We have forged a common Singaporean identity, grounded in our shared values and experiences, and our commitment to one another and our nation.\nThis is the legacy of generations of Singaporeans, with each one running a good race. The baton has now been passed and it is our turn to take Singapore forward. This Budget builds on previous Budgets, not only to address today’s challenges, but to plan ahead and secure Singapore’s future.\nBudget 2025 is a Budget for all Singaporeans. It is also a Budget shaped together with all Singaporeans. It further advances our Forward Singapore agenda, which incorporates your aspirations and views, and seeks to keep our society strong and united.\nIn this Budget, we will work with you to: tackle cost pressures; advance our growth frontier; equip workers throughout life; build a sustainable city; nurture a caring and inclusive society; and rally as one united people. I will go through each of these in turn.\nLet me start by addressing concerns over rising costs, for both individuals and businesses.\nGlobal inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and remained high after that due to energy, food and supply chain disruptions. Like many other countries, Singapore was impacted. That is why we have been providing additional support measures over the last two years to cushion the impact on Singaporeans.\nLast year, I enhanced the Assurance Package by $1.9 billion. The Package has helped to fully offset the effects of inflation for lower-income households and to provide a significant cushion for middle-income households. We will continue to provide support for as long as needed, within our means.\nWhile inflation is expected to ease further this year, prices remain high. Singaporeans are still adjusting to these new price realities. Some have had to tighten their belts, rethink spending habits, or make difficult trade-offs to manage their expenses. Therefore, in this Budget, I will provide additional support for Singaporeans. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex B-1\n.]\nFirst, I will provide $800 in Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers to every Singaporean household. The first $500 will be disbursed in May this year. And the remaining $300 will be disbursed in January next year. As with previous CDC Vouchers, half can be used at participating supermarkets. And the other half can be used at participating heartland merchants and hawkers.\nSecond, I will provide additional U-Save rebates to help households cope with their utilities expenses. Eligible Housing and Development Board (HDB) households will receive up to $760 this financial year. This is double the amount of regular U-Save rebates. It will cover about six months of utilities expenses for those living in 1- and 2-room flats, and three months of utilities expenses for those living in 3- and 4-room flats.\nThird, I will provide more support to families with children. They will receive $500 in LifeSG credits for each Singaporean child aged 12 and below this year. These credits are the same as the LifeSG credits we gave to National Servicemen last year. And parents can use them to defray their household expenses. Every Singaporean aged 13 to 20 this year will also receive a $500 top-up to their Edusave account, or their Post-Secondary Education Account. They can use this top-up to pay for their approved education-related expenses.\nMore support will be extended to individuals and families who face greater financial stress. We will increase the rates for the ComCare Assistance schemes, to better support lower-income households with basic living expenses. For example, a one-person household on Long-Term Assistance will receive an additional $120 each month, bringing the monthly cash assistance to $760. Those supported by Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance will also receive more than before, based on the household’s composition, needs and income.\nIn tandem, we will increase the Singapore Allowance, which is an ex-gratia payment that some of our pensioners receive. It will increase from $350 to $390 each month, to support those with smaller pensions. And the monthly pension ceiling will also increase to $1,320.\nThrough the ComCare Interim Assistance scheme, we will also provide more support for community organisations as well, to help households in need.\nWe are also paying close attention to public housing. We have ramped up our Build-To-Order (BTO) supply decisively. Application rates for BTO flats have stabilised and are now well below pre-COVID-19 levels. We will continue with the robust supply pipeline. Over the next three years, the Ministry of National Development (MND) will launch more than 50,000 new flats in a wide range of locations, including in Woodlands, Bayshore and Mount Pleasant.\nLast year, more than eight in 10 first-timer families who collected keys to their BTO flats were able to service their monthly mortgage loans with little or zero out-of-pocket cash. To put in perspective, this is a level of affordability that residents in other major cities like London, Sydney and Hong Kong do not enjoy. But we have been able to achieve this in Singapore. And we will continue to keep public housing affordable and accessible for all.\nSome Singaporeans prefer resale flats as they have shorter waiting times, but they are understandably concerned about the higher prices of resale flats. Our cooling and supply measures will eventually help to stabilise the resale market. Meanwhile, we will offer more options to home seekers who want their flats sooner.\nThis year, HDB will launch around 3,800 flats with a waiting time of less than three years. This is about 20% of the full year’s BTO supply. And we will continue to increase the supply of such flats in the coming years.\nHDB also launched the largest ever Sale of Balance Flats exercise last week, with around 5,500 flats available island-wide, and it plans to hold another balance flat exercise later this year.\nHigher prices also affect our businesses, many of whom are grappling with the higher costs of rent and labour. So, I will introduce a 50% Corporate Income Tax rebate in the Year of Assessment 2025.\nNot all companies are profitable and some may not benefit from such a rebate. So, I will provide every active company that employed at least one local employee last year a minimum benefit of $2,000. The total benefit that each company will receive will be capped at $40,000.\nDespite facing higher cost pressures, I am glad that many businesses remain committed to uplifting the wages of lower-wage workers. The Government will continue to share this responsibility with employers. And taking into account feedback from employers, I will enhance the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, by increasing the Government’s co-funding levels for wage increases from 30% in 2025 to 40%, and from 15% in 2026 to 20%. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex B-2\n.]\nThe measures we have taken in recent years and are taking in this Budget, will help to mitigate the impact of rising costs. But in the longer term, the best way to adjust to higher prices is to grow the economy and increase productivity, so that all Singaporeans can enjoy higher real incomes and better standards of living. And let me turn to our strategies next in these areas.\nWe will take bold and decisive actions to advance our growth frontier. The Singapore economy now operates at a higher level. But we cannot afford to stand still. Global economic competition is intensifying. And many other countries and cities are pressing ahead. If we fail to stay competitive, we will be left behind. We must therefore redouble efforts to grow our economy and keep it dynamic and vibrant.\nGrowth has a direct impact on the collective well-being of Singaporeans. Last year, our economy grew by more than 4%. This meant higher wages and real incomes for many, many workers. It will be hard to achieve 4% growth on a sustained basis. But if we can secure an average of 2% to 3% growth per annum over the next decade, we will be able to create better jobs and opportunities, and improve standards of living for all Singaporeans.\nTo achieve this, we must continue to uphold several fundamentals. That includes: maintaining sound monetary and fiscal policies; harnessing market forces to drive efficiency and innovation; staying open to people and ideas to strengthen our capabilities; and deepening our tripartite partnership as a cornerstone of economic stability.\nAt the same time, our approach and strategy must adapt to changing circumstances. At this stage of development, we can no longer compete on cost alone. Instead, we must differentiate ourselves by producing high-value solutions for the world.\nTo take our economy forward, this Budget will emphasise three key areas: technology and innovation, our enterprise ecosystem, as well as our infrastructure investments amidst resource constraints.\nFirst, we will enhance our technology and innovation engines. This is crucial because new ideas, innovation and technological progress are the drivers of growth. We see this in the US, where the technology sector, powered by Silicon Valley and companies like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla, has helped to propel the country’s dynamism and innovation.\nWe do not operate at the same scale as the US. But we can still excel in specific areas of innovation and technology. We have a new generation of local tech companies like Grab, Sea and Razer, which have established themselves as regional or industry leaders.\nWe are home to the world’s top tech companies. They already have substantial activities here and are keen to do more out of Singapore, including in new frontier areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing.\nWe also have considerable strengths in several industries. We are a key player in semi-conductors, supplying more than 10% of chips and producing one-fifth of semi-conductor equipment worldwide.\nJust as silicon chips fuel the tech industry, DNA chips are unlocking new frontiers in life sciences. These chips enable scientists to sequence DNA, which can be used to diagnose diseases or identify patient risks. They demand high levels of precision engineering, to implant millions of DNA strands onto a glass or silicon surface. Singapore alone produces more than 80% of the world’s DNA chips. In fact, we are a key node for the broader life sciences sector. Eight of the world’s top 10 pharmaceutical companies have manufacturing operations here. We are also a major producer of advanced medical devices, including cardiac implants and hearing aids.\nTake the example of American medtech company Illumina. It is the global leader in next-generation genetic sequencing instruments and DNA chips. Illumina has a strong footprint in Singapore. We serve as its Asia Pacific headquarters, and host a key research and development (R&D) and manufacturing site here. Illumina’s genome sequencer is designed and manufactured in Singapore. Engineers across different disciplines worked together to design this. When COVID-19 first emerged, it was such a machine that first sequenced the virus. It did so within hours, allowing scientists around the world to start developing drugs and vaccines. Illumina’s presence has benefited other Singapore enterprises, like Venture Corporation and Sunningdale Tech. Their partnerships with Illumina have helped them to build new innovation capabilities and expand to new areas.\nTo enhance our technology and innovation engines, we have to anchor more high-quality investments. There have been attempts internationally through Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0 to ensure that multinational enterprises (MNEs) pay a minimum level of taxes worldwide, or to tilt the playing field in favour of governments. But in reality, MNEs wield considerable leverage and options. And that is why governments everywhere are still spending significant amounts to attract investments.\nWe cannot afford to outbid the major economies, but we do need to set aside sufficient resources to maximise our competitive strengths. So, I will top up the National Productivity Fund by $3 billion. Our R&D efforts are critical in powering our innovation and technology engines. The Government has consistently invested about 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) annually in R&D over the last 20 years.\nThese investments have borne fruit. For example, our biotech ecosystem would not be where it is today without Biopolis, which we built more than 20 years ago. It also served as a platform for biotech talent to gather and share knowledge – knowledge that then diffused into our education system, which uplifted a new generation of Singaporeans.\nTo sustain this momentum, we must invest to keep our R&D infrastructure at the cutting edge.\nFor our biotech sector, we will refresh our public biosciences and medtech research infrastructure in the greater one-north area. This will provide state-of-the-art facilities, promote collaboration within our research community and enable faster translation of research into commercial solutions.\nIn the semi-conductor space, we will develop a new national semiconductor R&D fabrication facility. This will provide industry-grade tools for researchers and industry partners to prototype and test new semi-conductor innovations.\nThese developments will cost about $1 billion.\nWe will also support companies that undertake R&D and innovation in partnership with other stakeholders. We have a good suite of schemes today, which we will further enhance. And more details are in the Annex to the Budget.\nSecond, we will strengthen our enterprise ecosystem.\nOver the years, we have developed a stronger pool of globally competitive startups and enterprises.\tBut there is still more to be done. We want Singapore to be a place where exciting ventures develop and grow into the leading enterprises of the future.\nWe already have a good pipeline of such promising enterprises. For example, AEM Holdings is a Singapore-headquartered provider of semi-conductor testing solutions. Its products serve a critical role in the chip production process, by helping to detect manufacturing defects or design flaws. AEM today has a global footprint, with manufacturing plants and R&D teams across Asia, Europe and the US.\nWe will provide more support for enterprises to scale up, execute their growth plans and compete on the global stage. In particular, I will extend our support schemes for internationalisation, and for mergers and acquisitions. And again, the details are in the Annex to the Budget. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex C-1\n.]\nSome ventures are started by global companies, or by experienced entrepreneurs. As our investment promotion agency, the Economic Development Board (EDB), has close links with these multinational firms and entrepreneurs. So, EDB will launch a Global Founder Programme later this year to encourage global founders to anchor and grow more new ventures in Singapore.\nTo succeed, all enterprises must invest in technology to enhance their competitiveness and productivity. Enterprises can adopt off-the-shelf solutions like AI-powered analytics and digital marketing tools. We will continue to encourage the adoption of such solutions through initiatives like the Productivity Solutions Grant and the SMEs Go Digital.\nBeyond a certain stage, enterprises will need AI solutions, which are tailored to their needs and integrated into their business processes and systems. To support this, I will set aside up to $150 million for a new Enterprise Compute Initiative. Under this initiative, eligible enterprises will be partnered with major cloud service providers to access AI tools and computing power, as well as expert consultancy services. This will help enterprises leverage AI more effectively in their transformation journey.\nCompanies also need capital to execute their growth plans. We now have a more vibrant financing ecosystem, backed by a growing network of angel investors, venture capitalists and private equity firms. This is complemented by Government investment funds which invest in promising companies alongside commercial partners like 65 Equity Partners and Heliconia Capital.\nOver the past five years, we have set aside over $1.8 billion to support enterprise growth through investment funds. Like other private equity funds, our investments generally span a three- to seven-year horizon. To help enterprises with longer growth trajectories, we will deploy some of our funds as patient capital, with longer investment horizons, to ensure that promising companies have the resources they need to thrive.\nGlobally, we have seen the emergence of a private credit market which offers innovative financing solutions to enterprises. But few of these private credit funds focus on Asia, much less Singapore-based enterprises. So, we will introduce a new $1 billion Private Credit Growth Fund.\nThis will provide more financing options for high-growth local enterprises. And the Minister for Trade and Industry will share more at the Committee of Supply (COS).\nAs enterprises scale up, they may also list on a stock exchange to access more capital. Larger companies with significant overseas revenues will typically choose to list abroad to be closer to their main consumer markets. We recognise and accept these as commercial decisions. But there has been feedback that the Singapore Stock Exchange is not attractive, even for companies that are focused mainly on Singapore and Southeast Asia. And that is why we set up the Equities Market Review Group, chaired by Minister Chee Hong Tat, to strengthen the attractiveness of our stock market to such listings and investments.\nThe Review Group has developed its first set of measures. They include several tax-related recommendations which have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), just in time for the Budget. I accept their recommendations and will introduce tax incentives for Singapore-based companies and fund managers that choose to list in Singapore and grow their economic activities here. I will also introduce a tax incentive for fund managers which invest substantially in Singapore-listed equities, to encourage more investment in our capital markets. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex C-2\n.] The Review Group will share more details on its measures in the coming days.\nThird, to unlock our growth potential, we must invest in world-class infrastructure and find innovative ways to overcome our resource constraints. Singapore thrives as a hub economy, facilitating the flow of people, capital, goods and ideas. To sustain this position, we must ensure excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, both physically and digitally.\nDevelopment on the Tuas Port is progressing well, and Singapore recorded new highs last year in vessel arrival tonnage, container throughput and bunker sales. This reinforces our role as a leading maritime hub.\nWe have achieved island-wide 5G coverage and we are upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network to deliver speeds up to 10 times faster. This will enhance digital connectivity for businesses and individuals.\nOur air hub is another key pillar of connectivity. We will break ground for Changi Airport Terminal 5 in the coming months. When completed, Terminal 5 will expand our airport’s capacity by more than 50% and will ensure that Singapore remains a critical gateway for global travel and trade. To ensure sufficient resources to develop our air hub, I will top up the Changi Airport Development Fund by $5 billion.\nWith the President’s concurrence, the Government will also provide a guarantee to Changi Airport Group. This will help to lower the cost of borrowings needed to develop Terminal 5 and supporting infrastructure in Changi East.\nBesides infrastructure, we also need better solutions to address our resource constraints and enhance our economic resilience. A generation ago, our critical constraint was water. We tackled this head-on, developed NEWater and built our water industry. Today, we face a different challenge. The industries of the future – AI, semi-conductors, biopharmaceuticals – are highly energy-intensive.\nTo meet these growing energy needs and to bring down our carbon emissions at the same time, we will need more clean power. Expanding access to clean energy is therefore a major national imperative.\nOne immediate solution is to import low-carbon electricity from the region. We are making progress on such electricity imports. We have started a pilot with Peninsular Malaysia and expanded the capacity of a power trading initiative with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia. By 2035, we expect that about one-third of our projected electricity demand can be met through electricity imports.\nBut beyond imports, we also need to have our own domestic sources of clean power to ensure greater energy resilience. Our options are inherently limited, because we do not have the natural resources nor the land to meet our needs using hydro, wind, or solar power. We have been closely evaluating the use of low-carbon hydrogen for power generation. But there are inherent challenges in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen, which make it hard to scale up in a commercially viable manner.\nOne established low-carbon energy source that is used globally is nuclear power. We had considered the possibility of using nuclear power back in 2010. We assessed then that conventional nuclear technologies were not suitable for Singapore. But we continued to keep a close eye on nuclear energy developments and progressively built capabilities in nuclear safety over the past decade to keep our options open.\nSince then, we have seen significant advancements in nuclear technologies. One such development is that of small modular reactors (SMRs), which have better safety features than conventional reactors. Presently, only a few SMRs have been deployed around the world, but many more could become operational by the end of this decade.\nInterest in nuclear energy is also increasing worldwide. In our region, several countries are planning to include nuclear in their energy mix. Malaysia and Indonesia also have experience in nuclear technologies and have operated research reactors for some time.\nWe will therefore study the potential deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore. We will take further steps to systematically build up our capabilities in this area. We have signed agreements with the US on civil nuclear cooperation. We are also working on similar cooperation with other countries, which have capabilities and experience in civilian nuclear power, especially SMRs. Within the Government, we will re-organise ourselves to provide greater emphasis on this work. We will need new capabilities to evaluate options and to consider if there is a solution that Singapore can deploy in a safe and cost-effective way. And these capabilities will also be needed for nuclear safety, which will become more salient given the growing regional interest in nuclear power.\nBe it electricity imports, hydrogen or nuclear, we will need to make major investments in new infrastructure. And that is why we established the Future Energy Fund last year. I will top up the Fund by $5 billion. This will further support our critical undertaking to secure clean power for Singapore.\nOur efforts to enhance our technology and innovation engines, strengthen our enterprise ecosystem, invest in new infrastructure and overcome our resource constraints, will enable us to refresh our value proposition and stay ahead in a rapidly changing world.\nOver the decades, we can see how Singapore’s economic success has translated to tangible improvements in our lives.\nIn the past, tertiary graduates had fewer job options to choose from, with career paths revolving around a few traditional areas. These days, the job landscape is far more diverse. Those with an interest in science and engineering can pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing, information technology (IT), biomedical science and sustainability, amongst others. Those with strengths in creativity and people-oriented roles can explore careers in the creative industry, lifestyle and hospitality sectors, as well as sports and fitness. Our thriving care economy also offers a wider range of opportunities, including in early childhood education, healthcare and elder care.\nThis is what economic dynamism and growth can deliver for our people. And so, we will keep our economy strong and vibrant, and ensure that there are even more opportunities and good jobs for all Singaporeans – both now and in the future.\nA growing economy creates more well-paying jobs. But the jobs of the future will not be the same as the jobs of today. Rapid technological advances, especially in AI, will transform workplaces and jobs.\nJust a few years ago, tools like ChatGPT did not even exist. Now there is a rapidly expanding ecosystem of AI models. They can generate high-quality text, images and videos. They can write better programming code than many experts, assist in complex problem-solving and even help to accelerate research breakthroughs. AI will get better in the future and other new disruptive technologies will emerge. It is hard to predict how they will impact specific industries and jobs. But one thing is clear: our workers must be equipped with the skills to stay competitive and relevant.\nThat is why we are investing heavily in lifelong learning and have made significant moves to strengthen SkillsFuture as a key pillar of our social compact.\nAt last year’s Budget, I introduced the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme to support mid-career Singaporeans in getting a significant skills reboot. Under the programme, all Singaporeans aged 40 years and above will get $4,000 in SkillsFuture Credit.\nFrom next month, individuals can apply for a training allowance of up to $3,000 per month for selected full-time courses. They will have 24 months’ worth of allowance, which is up to $72,000 per worker.\nSome Singaporeans prefer to continue working, while upskilling on a part-time basis. Take, for example, Ms Zarina Binti Abdul Rahman. She started out as an intern in Randstad Sourceright, a global recruitment agency, and is now an office administrator. She wants to upgrade her skills in business operations, but is unable to pursue full-time studies due to her work and family commitments. So, she is pursuing a part-time Diploma in Business Practice at Nanyang Polytechnic.\nWhile workers like Zarina continue to earn their salaries during part-time training, they also incur training-related expenses. We will therefore extend the training allowance to workers undergoing part-time training. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex D-1\n.] They can enjoy a fixed allowance of $300 per month to defray their learning expenses. And this part-time training allowance will be implemented early next year. The Minister for Education will share more at the COS.\nWe will also give a further boost to our lower-wage workers, who will benefit from early upskilling. Today, our lower-wage workers can tap on the Workfare Skills Support Scheme from the age of 30. The scheme provides employers with absentee payroll support when they sponsor workers for training. It also provides workers with a training allowance when they go for self-sponsored training.\nCurrently, the Workfare Skills Support Scheme is designed primarily to support short courses that are completed over a few days. But lower-wage workers stand to benefit more from longer-form courses that provide more substantial reskilling and upskilling. We will therefore introduce an enhanced tier of support under the Workfare Skills Support for lower-wage workers. This enhanced support will be modelled after the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme and will benefit lower-wage workers when they turn 30. So, this will start earlier, at age 30. The Minister for Manpower will share more details at the COS. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex D-2\n.]\nOur Institutes of Higher Learning are key partners in supporting lifelong learning. They equip our workers with relevant skills for a changing economy, and provide a dedicated setting for deep learning. We will support the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) in developing a new city campus. This will enable SUSS to champion lifelong learning and deliver programmes with a strong social emphasis, at an accessible location in the city for learners of all ages.\nWe will also extend the Singapore Universities Trust by 10 years to 31 March 2042 to support the fundraising efforts of our newer Autonomous Universities, namely SUSS and the Singapore Institute of Technology. The Trust provides matching grants for donations to support our Autonomous Universities in building up their endowment funds.\nSir, the Government is fully committed to supporting the lifelong employability of our workers. We cannot stop the waves of technological innovations. Nor can we save every job. But we can and we will invest in every worker and every Singaporean. We will equip everyone with the skills to adapt, compete and succeed in a changing economy.\nAnd in tandem, we will help our companies to restructure and transform, and to upgrade their workforce.\nCompanies are best placed to drive business and workforce transformation. But some may face difficulties doing so due to short-term cost pressures. And we have also received feedback and suggestions to streamline and improve the way Government agencies administer their support to enterprises. We will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant. This will bring together existing schemes administered by Workforce Singapore (WSG) and SkillsFuture Singapore, and simplify the application process. The new grant will also provide higher funding support of up to 70% for job redesign activities.\nIn addition, we will introduce a redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. The credit is an existing scheme which helps employers defray the out-of-pocket costs for enterprise and workforce transformation. But to use the credit, companies have to pay upfront for staff training and then wait for reimbursement. And there are also employers who are not aware of the credit or how it can be used.\nSo, we will redesign the credit to make it more accessible. The revamped credit will operate more like an online wallet. Companies can easily check how much they have. And they can use the credits to immediately offset out-of-pocket costs for eligible workforce transformation initiatives and courses, rather than do so on a reimbursement basis. All companies with at least three resident employees will get a fresh $10,000 in the redesigned SkillsFuture Enterprise credit. The new credit will be available in the second half of 2026 and will last for three years.\nMeanwhile, companies can continue to use the existing credit. It was originally due to expire in June this year, but we will extend it until the new credit is ready.\nOur tripartite partners play key roles in workforce transformation. In particular, the National Trades Union Congress' (NTUC’s) Company Training Committees (CTCs) bring union leaders and employers together to design and implement workforce upgrading plans.\nThe results have been promising. Since the initiative started in 2019, NTUC has set up more than 2,700 CTCs. Almost four in five are in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Through the NTUC’s CTC grant, NTUC is supporting more than 400 transformation projects, which will benefit over 7,000 workers with better work prospects.\nNTUC would like to start more CTCs and help more companies transform. We will support them in their efforts. I will set aside additional funding of around $200 million for NTUC’s CTC grant, to help more companies transform. We will also expand the CTC grant to support employer-led training that leads to formal qualifications or certifications.\nLet me show how companies can benefit from all of these initiatives in a concrete way. Take for example SATS, our main air cargo handler and airline caterer at Changi Airport. SATS is investing in new equipment and technology to improve the efficiency of its catering services. It also needs to train its workers to handle the new equipment, and redesign workflows and jobs. It can access the additional $10,000 in SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. It can tap on the new SkillsFuture Workforce Development Grant to cover up to 90% of the cost for reskilling workers, and up to 70% of the cost for redesigning jobs.\nSATS has worked with NTUC to form a CTC and has been sending its employees for the Work-Study Diploma in Airport Operations at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). The Work-Study Diploma helps these employees acquire critical skills, including managing operations and resource planning. And they can go on to take on supervisory roles in SATS, subject to good performance.\nCurrently, SATS fully sponsors its workers’ out-of-pocket programme fees. The CTC grant will help to offset some of these training costs and provide enhanced funding for absentee payroll when the trainee is away from work. So, these are tangible benefits that companies can enjoy and we encourage all companies to press on with their workforce and business transformation.\nIn addition to broader workforce transformation, we will strengthen our support to nurture and groom Singaporean leaders in the corporate sector.\nMore and more Singaporeans are taking on leadership roles in large firms and MNEs operating here. We want to grow this leadership pipeline. We will provide more support to equip Singaporeans and enable them to succeed on their own merit. To compete for leadership roles with regional and global responsibilities, Singaporeans must gain overseas experience – managing operations in different countries, navigating diverse cultures and working seamlessly across borders.\nCurrently, Government agencies like Enterprise Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Infocomm Media Development Authority have schemes which support companies to send Singaporeans for overseas work postings and leadership milestone programmes. The feedback from such schemes has been positive. So, we will set aside more resources to increase the capacity of these schemes and provide more opportunities for promising Singaporean leaders. And the Minister for Manpower will share more at the COS.\nEven with reskilling and upskilling, some workers may face career setbacks due to economic and business disruptions. We will help workers who lose their jobs to get back on their feet through the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, which will start from April this year. The scheme will provide financial support of up to $6,000 over six months, to give our workers assurance as they undergo training or search for jobs.\nWe will also increase the provision of career matching services. Today, WSG and its partners, like NTUC’s e2i, run about 30 centres and touchpoints island-wide, placing about 40,000 jobseekers every year. The centres work with the jobseekers to shortlist jobs, work on their resumes and prepare them for interviews.\nBesides nation-wide programmes, there is benefit in facilitating job search at a localised level. This will help jobseekers who prefer to take on jobs near their homes, for example, to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.\nToday, North East CDC runs Job Placement Centres for its district, in partnership with WSG. The centres have yielded meaningful outcomes. We will expand localised job matching to all CDCs across the island.\nWe will also strengthen our support for two groups of workers in this Budget – seniors and ex-offenders.\nMore seniors are staying employed as our population ages. We want to work with employers to tap on the experience and wisdom of seniors who are able and wish to continue working. In the immediate term, I will extend the Senior Employment Credit (SEC) by one year to end-2026. This will provide wage offsets for employers who hire Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above, and earning less than $4,000 a month. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex D-3\n.]\nIn line with the increase in the re-employment age, I will raise the qualifying age for the highest SEC wage support tier to 69 years old, from 68 years old today. The Government will reimburse companies up to 7% of the wages that they pay to workers aged 69 and above.\nLater this year, the Ministry of Manpower will convene a Tripartite Workgroup on Senior Employment. The workgroup will undertake a holistic and longer-term review of senior employment policies, to improve the employability of seniors and increase the availability of jobs that better suit their needs.\nIn line with the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers, we will proceed with the next step of planned Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rate increases for senior workers. We will increase the CPF contribution rates for those aged above 55 to 65 by 1.5 percentage points in 2026. We will also continue to provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for another year to cover half of the increase in employer contributions for 2026. With this move, senior workers can build up their retirement savings. And businesses will get continued support from the Government to cushion the impact on business cost. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex D-4\n.]\nFor ex-offenders, employment is integral to their re-integration into society. To encourage employers to give ex-offenders a second chance, we had earlier introduced the Uplifting Employment Credit, which provides a wage offset to employers hiring ex-offenders. Last year, the credit supported close to 700 employers in hiring more than 1,500 ex-offenders. To encourage more employers to hire ex-offenders, I will extend the Uplifting Employment Credit to end-2028.\nSir, Singaporeans are at the core of everything we do. We will do everything we can to develop and realise the potential of all our people, so that they, in turn, realise their aspirations and dreams for themselves and their families. [\nApplause.\n]\nOur Singapore Story is one of sustained investment and continuous improvement. Over time, we have transformed our living environment into a thriving metropolis and a beautiful home.\nThere is still much more to do in the years ahead. We will: upgrade our homes and estates; refresh and rejuvenate our landscape and infrastructure; and importantly, prepare for a future of rising global temperatures.\nAddressing the climate crisis requires strong international collaboration and collective action. Unfortunately, momentum on global climate efforts has slowed. This will make it harder for all of us to tackle climate change.\nDespite these challenges, we remain resolute in our commitment to decarbonisation. We will work with international partners and do our part to sustain efforts and drive meaningful progress. Just a week ago, we submitted our new climate target to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We have committed to reducing our emissions to between 45 and 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2035. This will bring us one step closer to realising our longer-term aim of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\nI shared earlier about our plans to access more sources of clean power. That will be critical for us to achieve net zero.\nBeyond energy, we will also accelerate efforts to decarbonise our transport sector, which accounts for about 15% of our total emissions today. Our aim is to have 100% cleaner energy vehicles by 2040 and we are making good progress towards this target.\nLast year, around a third of all new cars registered were Electric Vehicles (EVs) and almost half were hybrid vehicles. But adoption of clean energy variants of heavy vehicles has been slower, due to limited model availability, higher upfront costs and less accessible charging infrastructure. To accelerate the adoption of clean heavy vehicles, we will introduce a new Heavy Vehicle Zero Emissions Scheme and an Electric Heavy Vehicle Charger Grant. These schemes will provide incentives for the purchase of a heavy vehicle, and co-funding of the charging infrastructure. The Minister for Transport will share more at COS.\nCurrently, drivers of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles pay fuel excise duties. These duties contribute to revenue and also serve as a form of usage charge. EVs, while much less pollutive, should not be exempted from usage charges. We are still considering how to design a usage-charge mechanism for cleaner energy vehicles. In the interim, we have introduced the Additional Flat Component (AFC) of road tax, for cars and electric light goods vehicles. We will now introduce the AFC for electric heavy goods vehicles and buses. The AFC will be set at $250 per year for electric heavy goods vehicles, and $190 and $550 per year for electric minibuses and large buses respectively. It will be phased in over three years starting from January 2026 and will be implemented in full by January 2028.\nAlongside electrification, increasing the use of mass public transport is central to reducing emissions and our vision of a more connected and car-lite Singapore. Our target is for eight in 10 households to be within a 10-minute walk from a train station.\nWe are investing over $60 billion in this decade to expand and renew our rail network, which forms the backbone of our public transport system. Singaporeans can look forward to the new Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line, as well as the extensions of the Thomson-East Coast Line, Downtown Line and the Circle Line. We will continue to study how our rail network can be expanded.\nAnd we are also investing close to an additional $1 billion to increase and enhance our bus services under the Bus Connectivity Enhancement Programme.\nAs we do our part to reduce emissions in Singapore, we also have to assume the worst and take steps to protect ourselves against climate risks. If the world continues on a fossil fuel-based development trajectory over the coming years, global temperatures will keep rising and that means we can expect a mean sea level rise of over one metre by 2100. Coupled with high tides and storm surges, the impact will be significant, well above one metre, and that means that around one-third of Singapore will be vulnerable to coastal flooding.\nWe are therefore developing and implementing plans to better protect our island. We will employ a range of solutions to do so. These range from static structures like sea walls, to more specialised measures like barrages and tidal gates, as well as reclamation to create more land.\nIn the southeastern part of Singapore, we earlier announced plans to reclaim land to develop “Long Island”. Besides raising the ground level above rising sea levels, this will create additional space for homes, as well as new waterfront parks for outdoor recreation. In addition, PUB will complete site-specific studies for the Greater Southern Waterfront and Changi this year; studies for Jurong Island and the Northwest Coast are also underway. And step by step, we will complete the plans for coastal protection around the entire island.\nThe actual implementation of measures could stretch over two decades or longer, starting from the 2030s onwards. But it would be prudent to set aside funds now to ensure we can proceed with these major investments, which will benefit current and future generations. So, I will top up the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund by $5 billion.\nThe Government is taking steps to green our energy and transport sectors and to protect our island from climate risks. Singaporeans too, have a part to play in this. Sustainability is everyone’s responsibility. Individuals have the power to drive change through their choices and behaviour.\nTo fully realise our green future, we will need to make lifestyle adjustments and adopt sustainable habits in our daily lives. Every individual action counts.\nLast year, we enhanced the Climate Friendly Households Programme by extending it to all HDB households, increased the vouchers quantum to $300 and expanded its use to a broader range of energy- and water-efficient products. We will further enhance the programme by providing an additional $100 worth of Climate Vouchers to HDB households. We will also extend the Climate Vouchers to all Singapore Citizen households living in private properties. [\nApplause.\n]\nI encourage all households to make the switch to more resource-efficient products if you have not done so already.\nWe have come a long way in building today’s Singapore. But our journey is far from over. Our next decade will be pivotal, as we accelerate efforts to decarbonise our economy, and enhance the climate resilience of our built environment. We have clear plans to do so. And as long as this Government is in charge, we are committed to delivering them. We will ensure that our island nation survives even as the oceans rise and we will build a better and greener future for all.\nA major part of our Forward Singapore agenda is to nurture a more caring and inclusive society – one where every Singaporean feels valued and supported, regardless of age, ability and circumstance. And in this year’s Budget, I will take further steps towards these goals.\nFamilies play a key role in strengthening our society and supporting each of us to be the best version of ourselves. Lower-income and vulnerable families face more challenges. So, we will do more to support their efforts to achieve stability, self-reliance and mobility.\nLast year, we introduced ComLink+. Under this initiative, we are providing more customised support. Family coaches and volunteer befrienders work directly with ComLink+ families. Together, they develop concrete action plans to achieve nearer- and longer-term goals, like obtaining employment and saving for a home.\nAs the families make progress, they will receive financial top-ups in the form of ComLink+ Progress Packages. For example, families can receive up to $30,000 in CPF top-ups if the adults sustain employment and do their part to save up for a home.\nIn tandem with ComLink+, we have the Fresh Start Housing Scheme. It helps second-timer families with children living in public rental flats to start afresh and own their own homes by buying a shorter-lease new flat with an additional housing grant.\nWe will enhance Fresh Start. Today, eligible families can receive a $50,000 grant to buy a new 2-room Flexi or Standard 3-room flat on a shorter lease. We will increase the grant to $75,000. [\nApplause.\n]\nThere are also first-timer families with children living in public rental flats. They typically face more significant challenges in life, like coping with medical issues in the family, or raising children as a single parent. Hence, they may have difficulties buying a flat with a full 99-year lease, even as first-timers. To support these families in their home ownership journey, we will allow them to buy shorter-lease subsidised flats through Fresh Start. And the Minister for National Development will share more at the COS.\nWhile we provide targeted help for the more vulnerable groups, we will also do more to support all families across every stage of life. This begins with marriage and parenthood. We have made significant moves in recent years, including enhancing the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and the Government’s contributions to the Child Development Account (CDA). We have just enhanced paid parental leave to 30 weeks in total, which will enable parents to spend more time with their infants.\nIn this Budget, we will further reduce monthly full-day childcare fee caps in Government-supported preschools. The fees will be capped at $610 for Anchor Operator centres and $650 for Partner Operator centres. After basic childcare subsidies, a dual-income family will pay about $300 per child. Lower- and middle-income families will pay less after additional subsidies. So, this reduction will keep full-day preschool expenses similar to those of the fees for primary school and after-school student care combined.\nCouples with more children often worry about additional costs, because the demands grow with each additional child. We will introduce a Large Families Scheme to support married couples who have, or aspire to have, three or more children. This will consist of three components. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex F-1\n.]\nFirst, a $5,000 increase in the Child Development Account First Step Grant. This will apply to each third and subsequent child born from today onwards. The CDA monies can be used to defray preschool and healthcare expenses of the child and their siblings.\nSecond, a new $5,000 Large Family MediSave Grant. This will be disbursed into the mother’s MediSave account again for each third and subsequent child born from today onwards. And this can be used to offset the mother’s pregnancy and delivery costs, or her family members’ healthcare expenses.\nThird, $1,000 in LifeSG credits will be disbursed annually to families for each of their third and subsequent children, during the years that the child turns one to six. And this can help to defray a wide range of household expenses.\nLet me illustrate what all this means for couples with young children.\nTake the example of Elizabeth and Mervin. They have four children, turning one, four, seven and eight this year. They will receive $500 in LifeSG credits for each child. This is to help them with cost pressures, which I had highlighted earlier in my speech. They will also receive $1,000 annually in Large Family LifeSG credits for each of their third and fourth children, up to when they turn six. That amounts to $11,000 in benefits from this Budget.\nOr take another example. Joel and Kristen have two daughters turning three and five this year. They are expecting a baby boy in May. Again, they will receive the one-off $500 in LifeSG credits for each of their children. But with a third child on the way, they will receive the full benefits of the Large Families Scheme – $5,000 in CDA, $5,000 in MediSave and $1,000 every year until the child is six years old. So, as a family, they will receive a total of $17,500.\nSeniors are an important part of many families. To support our seniors to live and age well, we have been reviewing and updating our approach to retirement, healthcare and caregiving.\nWe have provided seniors more assurance for their retirement adequacy. We introduced the Majulah Package, to support all seniors born in 1973 or earlier. And we also enhanced the Workfare Income Supplement and the Silver Support Scheme.\nOur priority is to empower our seniors to stay active and healthy. And that is why we rolled out Healthier SG and Age Well SG. Our plans include creating a more conducive living environment for our seniors. Through the Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme, we have significantly improved the mobility and safety of seniors through subsidised senior-friendly fittings and installations in HDB households. These have been well-received by HDB residents.\nWe will expand EASE for three years up to 2028 to households living in private properties, so that more seniors can benefit. [\nApplause.\n]\nAs we get older, we are all likely to spend more on healthcare. To provide more assurance, we will introduce a five-year Matched MediSave Scheme. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex F-2\n.] The scheme will be made available to eligible lower-income seniors aged 55 to 70 years old. For every dollar of voluntary top-ups received in their MediSave accounts, the Government will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant of up to $1,000 per year. So, this will complement the existing Matched Retirement Savings Scheme.\nBoth matched savings schemes will help lower-income seniors, especially our grandmothers, mothers and aunts who were homemakers and caregivers. The contributions from the Government and their loved ones will better support their retirement and healthcare needs, and give them greater assurance as they age.\nWhile we will do our best to help our seniors stay healthy, the reality is that over time more of them will become frail and may require long-term care. Currently, the Government provides significant subsidies for long-term care services, particularly for lower- and middle-income families. This is complemented by CareShield Life, which is our national long-term care insurance scheme, which provides a monthly cash payout upon severe disability.\nWe will increase our support for seniors with more severe care needs and who may require residential care, such as in a nursing home. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex F-3\n.] We will increase existing subsidies for residential long-term care services by up to 15 percentage points. We will also raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income to $4,800.\nMany in the older cohorts, especially those born in 1969 or earlier, do not benefit from CareShield Life and therefore will face higher out-of-pocket costs. For this group, we will introduce additional subsidies of five percentage points.\nMany seniors prefer to age in place as much as possible, supported by their families and friends. They can opt for a range of care options. Some may use care services like day care or home care, while others rely primarily on family caregiving. We will also enhance support across the entire spectrum.\nWe will increase existing subsidies for long-term care services in the home and community by up to 10 percentage points and similarly raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income to $4,800. And we will similarly introduce additional subsidies for cohorts born in 1969 and earlier by 15 percentage points. We will also increase the subsidies provided under the Seniors’ Mobility and Enabling Fund to cover the rising costs of home healthcare items, like adult diapers, and to also cover additional categories of such items.\nTo better support those who are looking after seniors at home, we will enhance the Home Caregiving Grant. This is a cash grant which can be used to offset daily care costs. We will raise the quantum for the Home Caregiving Grant. The maximum grant will increase to $600 per month, from $400 today.\nWe will also raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for the Home Caregiving Grant to $4,800, so that more caregivers receive support. We expect at least 80,000 seniors to benefit from the enhanced long-term care subsidies and grants, which will be implemented from next year. The enhancements are expected to cost around $300 million in FY2026, and more in future years, as our population continues to age.\nBesides higher subsidies, insurance will also play a part in easing the cost burden of long-term care. With a rapidly ageing population, we have to work hard to manage the increase in long-term care costs, and ensure a good mix of funding support between individual co-payment, government subsidies and insurance. We are studying this issue carefully, and the Minister for Health will say more at COS.\nWe will also do more to support persons with disabilities and ensure they can live with dignity and pursue their aspirations.\nWe have laid good foundations with our investments in Early Intervention and Special Education, which support persons with disabilities until they are around 18. But many parents worry about what happens post-18, after their children graduate from the structured environment of a Special Education (SPED) school. We are looking into these post-18 pathways for these students and studying how we can provide more meaningful support. In particular, those who are transiting to work may need more support to build up their work readiness and adjust to an employment setting. This includes additional learning support to gain soft skills and to adapt to new routines.\nTake 21-year-old Sharlyne Lee, for example. After graduating from Saint Andrew’s Autism School in 2021, she underwent three months of employment training in housekeeping and soft skills. She was able to secure a nine-month internship with the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home as a General Housekeeping Assistant, under supportive supervisors. At the end of the internship, she was offered full-time employment. And she is now doing well at this Home and happy to do her part to take care of the residents there. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex I-1\n.]\nWe want to see more stories like her. And so, we will invest more in building the support structures for persons with disabilities to transit more smoothly from school to work. We will also do more for those with higher care needs, who need a more structured environment beyond school to stay active. These are issues which we will study comprehensively with stakeholders. It will be a multi-year endeavour and the Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister for Education will share more at the COS.\nConcurrently, we will provide more support for employers, who may be concerned about the costs and effort needed to redesign jobs and adapt their workplaces when they hire people with disabilities. In particular, we will extend the Enabling Employment Credit to end-2028, to offset wages for persons with disabilities. We will also provide more financial support to persons with disabilities. Their caregivers may benefit from the increase in the Home Caregiving Grant which I mentioned earlier.\nAs with the enhancements for seniors, we will increase subsidy rates for adult disability services and raise the maximum qualifying per capita household income for these subsidies. And we will expand the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme to include eligible Singaporeans with disabilities regardless of their age, to help them save for retirement early. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex F-4\n.]\nWe will also step up efforts by SG Enable and the Special Needs Trust Company (SNTC) to encourage families to plan ahead for their child’s future care needs. Today, caregivers can set up financial care plans and set aside monies in trust accounts with SNTC, which will manage the trust monies for the person with disability when their caregivers pass on. To support these efforts, we will provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for top-ups by lower- and middle-income caregivers to the trust accounts, up to $10,000.\nSir, we are taking concrete steps to strengthen our social support system. In this Budget, I have focused on families, seniors and their long-term care needs, and persons with disabilities. But we will continue to review and update other policy areas over time. This is the Government’s key priority. Because we want to build a Singapore where we have each other’s backs, where no one is left behind and where we continue to stay strong and united as one people. [\nApplause.\n]\nSingaporeans across different generations and from all walks of life have played a vital role in getting us to SG60. For a country, 60 years is a short time. But we have made great strides over this period and there is much to be grateful for.\nIn this Budget, I will introduce an SG60 package to recognise the contributions of all Singaporeans and to share the benefits of our nation's progress. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex G-1\n.]\nFirst, I will give SG60 Vouchers to all Singaporeans aged 21 and above this year. Each one will receive $600 in SG60 Vouchers. Singaporean seniors aged 60 and above will receive $200 more – so, $800 in vouchers. [\nApplause.\n]\nThe SG60 Vouchers are like CDC Vouchers. They can be used at all businesses that accept CDC Vouchers – and half can be spent at participating supermarkets and the other half at participating heartland merchants and hawkers. We will disburse the SG60 Vouchers across the month of July. Seniors will claim first, and the rest later. The People’s Association and the CDCs will share more details later.\nSecond, I will provide a Personal Income Tax Rebate of 60%, for the Year of Assessment 2025. This will be capped at $200, so that the rebate mostly benefits our middle-income workers.\nThird, as Minister Indranee had announced earlier, we will welcome all Singapore Citizen babies born this year with an SG60 Baby Gift.\nOur unity is a precious asset, which we must never take for granted. The experiences of countries around the world show how easy it is for trust to be eroded, and for societies to become deeply divided and polarised. We must therefore remain steadfast in nurturing our cohesion and unity. And in this Budget, we will invest more in strengthening our cultural core and our community bonds.\nWe will introduce an SG Culture Pass, to encourage Singaporeans to attend arts and heritage activities. All Singaporeans aged 18 and above this year will receive $100 worth of credits, which they can use for eligible activities, like arts and cultural performances, museum exhibitions and heritage experiences. The credits will be made available from September this year and are valid until the end of 2028. The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth will share more about upcoming initiatives for the arts and heritage sector.\nOur hawker centres and markets are an integral part of our way of life. This year marks over half a century since we built our first hawker centres and markets, and the fifth anniversary of the inscription of our Hawker Culture onto the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nTo appreciate our hawkers and market stallholders, we will give each stall in centres managed by Government and Government-appointed operators a one-time rental support of $600 this year. We will also allocate up to $1 billion over the next 20 to 30 years to upgrade ageing hawker centres and to build new centres. This will serve the changing needs of our stallholders and patrons. The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment will provide more details at the COS.\nSports is another avenue for Singaporeans of all races, religions and backgrounds to come together. Last year, we cheered on Team Singapore at the Olympics and Paralympics, rejoicing as our flag was raised high. We celebrate with them when they do well and we encourage them when they face setbacks. We are building new facilities in our heartlands, so that Singaporeans can enjoy sports closer to where they live. In the coming years, we will have new sports facilities in Toa Payoh, Punggol and Clementi. And we are also upgrading existing facilities in Pasir Ris, Queenstown and Hougang.\nWe will provide $100 in SG60 ActiveSG credits for all ActiveSG members to enjoy sports together with their family and friends. You can sign up for the free membership at the ActiveSG website and can use these credits to book ActiveSG facilities and programmes.\nOur solidarity has seen us through many challenges, including our fight against COVID-19. We must continue to help our fellow citizens and ensure we move forward together, as a people and a nation. To encourage this spirit of giving, the Government provides matching funds that multiply the impact of donations. This year, we will increase our support for the fund-raising efforts of charities and social causes.\nWe will provide a $100 million top-up to the Cultural Matching Fund and extend it for five years until the end of FY2029. The Government and Tote Board now provide dollar-for-dollar matching grants for the fund-raising projects of Singapore-registered charities. We will provide a $270 million top-up to this Enhanced Fund-Raising Programme, which will be extended for three years until the end of FY2027.\nMany Singaporeans are passionate about social causes but may not have a specific charity in mind. The Community Chest, the Collective for a Stronger Society and the President’s Challenge provide platforms that help donors contribute to a range of programmes. We will introduce a $250 million SG Gives matching grant to provide dollar-for-dollar matching for donations made through these platforms. And to encourage sustained giving amongst larger donors, we will provide a higher $1.50 in matching for donations with a minimum three-year commitment of at least $250,000 per year.\nIn total, the Government and Tote Board will set aside more than $600 million in matching funds to strengthen our spirit of giving.\nEarlier, I had shared about the SG60 Vouchers. Those who are better off may want to donate their vouchers to those with greater needs. We will facilitate this and we will share more on how to do so in due course.\nOur self-help groups play an important role in addressing the needs of their respective communities and in strengthening our social compact. I thank the Chinese Development Assistance Council, Yayasan MENDAKI, the Singapore Indian Development Association and the Eurasian Association for their many contributions. We will provide the self-help groups with additional funding of $60 million over the next five years. This will enable them to enhance their programmes and better support their communities.\nMany businesses have also stepped forward to support their fellow Singaporeans in this SG60 year, and will be providing special SG60 discounts and offers. I would like to encourage more businesses to join in and offer their support.\nSingapore is at its strongest when we stand together. We may have our differences. But we are all Singaporeans, living on this tiny red dot, as one family. When we rally together as one, there is no challenge we cannot overcome. And this unity is what keeps us resilient, thriving and moving forward, even in an uncertain and troubled world.\nA critical enabler for Singapore’s continued success is sound and healthy public finances. We achieve this by living within our means and running a balanced budget over each term of government. This means spending prudently to meet our immediate and future needs, ensuring that our revenues cover expenditures and keeping the tax burden as low as we can, while not burdening Singaporeans with debt.\nIn this term of government, we have made several significant changes to our tax system. These revenue moves give us the resources we need to meet our spending needs and also make our fiscal system more progressive.\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate increase ensures we have the revenues to look after our growing number of seniors, even with rising healthcare costs. Through the Assurance Package, we have cushioned and delayed the impact of the GST increase for the majority of Singaporean households. Importantly, we have designed our GST system with permanent GST vouchers. This ensures that lower-income households pay a far lower effective GST rate than higher-income households.\nWe also continue to ensure fairness and improve progressivity in our tax system. This means that those who are better off will pay more in taxes to help their fellow citizens.\nThat is why we raised Property Tax rates for all non-owner-occupied residential properties, which are mainly investment properties, as well as for higher-value owner-occupied residential properties. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex H-2\n.]\nThe Property Tax rate changes coincided with a sharp increase in the Annual Values of properties, which arose because of COVID-19-related supply constraints in the property market. We have therefore revised and updated the Annual Value bands of owner-occupier Property Tax rates for residential properties. And that means that more homes now fall within bands with lower tax rates.\nTo further cushion the impact, we provided Property Tax rebates. In November last year, we announced another rebate of up to 20% for owner-occupied residential properties in 2025, capped at $1,000. Taken together, all HDB owner-occupiers and over 90% of private residential property owner-occupiers will see lower Property Taxes this year.\nThe changes we made to our tax system this term have put us on a stronger fiscal footing. They provide us the resources we need to better meet our society’s needs – all while keeping our overall system of taxes and transfers fair and progressive.\nLet me turn to our latest fiscal position. [\nPlease refer to\nAnnex H-1\n.] For FY2024, our revenue collections were better than expected. A key reason is the upside in our Corporate Income Tax. In the past, our Corporate Income Tax collections were quite stable, at about 3.2% of GDP. But collections increased significantly in the last two years and are projected to reach 4.1% of GDP in FY2024, which is quite significant.\nThis is an unexpected change. Corporate Income Tax is now the single largest contributor to total revenue – larger than even the Net Investment Returns Contribution.\nThere are several reasons for this higher Corporate Income Tax collection. Part of it is due to industry-specific cyclical factors, for example, in finance and wholesale trade. It could also be due to changes in the investment decisions of multinational enterprises, as they seek out stable and reliable centres like Singapore to put more of their high-end activities.\nWhile our revenues have increased, we have also spent more on Singaporeans. For example, we provided $3 billion in MediSave top-ups in December last year, which will help to cushion the increase in MediShield Life premiums to fund better coverage and higher payouts. We also earmarked resources for projects to boost economic competitiveness, including developing critical infrastructure like Changi Terminal 5, and for the energy transition.\nOverall, I expect to end FY2024 with a surplus of $6.4 billion, or 0.9% of GDP. For FY2025, I expect a similar fiscal position, with a surplus of $6.8 billion, or 0.9% of GDP.\nWe will continue to keep an eye on our medium-term fiscal projections. In 2023, MOF released an Occasional Paper showing that we expect to keep our fiscal position roughly balanced until 2030. For now, this remains our assessment. And let me explain.\nThere is still considerable uncertainty about how Government revenues will unfold over the coming decades. At this juncture, it is too early to determine if the recent increase in Corporate Income Tax collections is temporary or a lasting trend. There could be some additional Corporate Income Tax revenue from FY2027 onwards, with the implementation of the Domestic Top-up Tax, which will raise the large MNEs’ effective tax rate to 15%. But how much revenue we will get from this change depends on whether these MNEs continue to find it attractive to remain in Singapore. Moreover, there is now great uncertainty about the global tax environment. The new US administration has withdrawn from the earlier consensus forged by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other countries. And it remains to be seen what further moves the US and other major economies will make in this new geopolitical environment.\nSo, we will assess our options as global tax developments unfold and adjust our policies where necessary. Meanwhile, we are certain that expenditure will continue to rise. Government spending has been rising steadily over the years from about 15% of GDP to about 18%. And based on historical trends, we can expect our spending to go up to 20% of GDP by around 2030.\nWith growing global uncertainties, the need to invest more in our workers and better support our rapidly ageing population, there will be added pressure to raise spending – possibly at a pace that exceeds previous increases.\nSo, we will continue to monitor fiscal trends closely and update our medium-term projections. In the meantime, we will spend responsibly and ensure resources are allocated effectively. If and when there are near-term fiscal upsides, we will put the resources to good use, including for our social and economic needs. Ultimately, we will always ensure that all Singaporeans benefit from our nation’s progress.\nMr Speaker, 60 years in Chinese culture marks a full cycle of life. So, in this SG60 year, we will complete one cycle, and we will enter a new phase of nation-building. We must brace ourselves for new challenges in this next phase. There are dark clouds over the horizon. The world is in turmoil and the situation is likely to get worse in the coming years.\nBut this is not the first time that Singapore has had to confront tough external circumstances. We have done so repeatedly over the last six decades and so, we can draw confidence from what we have been through together.\nConsider the experiences of our Pioneers. Like Mr Yau Jon Kiang, who is 75 this year and a resident in Yew Tee. In our early years of nation-building, he and his wife worked long hours in a canteen at the Tanjong Gul Camp at Tuas. They put food on the table for the SAF, as well as their own young sons at home. Times were tough, but they persevered.\nTheir never-say-die spirit lives on in the family. Jon Kiang’s son, Joses, forged his own path to become a naval engineer with the SAF. He endured long stints at sea to serve and defend our nation. Determined to improve his family’s future, he pursued part-time studies and earned an engineering degree, while juggling work and family responsibilities. His children are now entering adulthood, at 17 and 22. They have grown up in a more affluent Singapore, but they too face their share of challenges. His daughter Jamie started at Singapore Polytechnic just as the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Her school went online, and her daily activities were disrupted. But she did not let that get her down. She adapted and pushed forward, just as her father and grandfather had done before her.\nI met Jamie and some of her fellow youth leaders back in 2022, after we had battled COVID-19 for two and a half years; they were optimistic, resilient and full of ideas about how they can contribute. Since then, Jamie has graduated from Singapore Polytechnic as Valedictorian. Today, she is pursuing her Bachelor’s in Integrative Studies at Singapore Management University, while leading a non-profit to empower and support youths in tech. She hopes to work in the philanthropic sector to make a greater impact after graduation.\nThis is what the Singapore spirit is about. At every turn, we have chosen determination over despair, innovation over stagnation, and solidarity over division. Every generation has carved a path through its challenges and paved the way for the next generation to go even further.\nBudget 2025 sets out clear plans for us to continue this journey with confidence. It is a Budget for the future – tackling immediate challenges, while laying the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient tomorrow. It is a Budget for all Singaporeans. Because when Singapore thrives, every citizen benefits. Every Singaporean is supported from birth to old age, with more support given to those with less. No one is left behind.\nImportantly, this is a Budget shaped together with all Singaporeans – advancing our Forward Singapore efforts to build the Singapore we want and empowering each of us to contribute towards our shared future.\nThe road ahead will not be without challenges, but I am confident that our best days lie ahead of us. Together, we can keep Singapore an evergreen oasis of stability, hope, and opportunity for all. So, let us move onward together for a better tomorrow. Mr Speaker, I seek to move. [\nApplause\n.]\nMr Speaker\n: The Question is, \"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the Financial Year 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026.\"\nIn accordance with paragraph (1) of Standing Order No 89, the debate now stands adjourned.

    "sectionType": "WANA",
    "content": "22\nMr Mark Lee\nasked the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance regarding the recent withdrawal of the United States’ support for the OECD's global corporate minimum tax under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 2.0 framework (a) what are the implications for Singapore's implementation of the domestic minimum top-up tax starting in 2025; (b) how does this development affect international tax cooperation; and (c) what is the Ministry’s assessment of the risks for Singapore's competitiveness, particularly in attracting multinational enterprises.\n23\nMr Mark Lee\nasked the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance regarding concerns of fragmentation in global tax standards from the withdrawal of the United States’ support for the OECD's global corporate minimum tax (a) whether Singapore's tax strategies will be adjusted to ensure it remains a pro-business and investment-friendly hub; (b) what measures will be taken to mitigate risks to key sectors or industries reliant on Singapore's tax advantages; and (c) how will Singapore balance its compliance to global frameworks against the risk of losing its competitive edge.\nMr Lawrence Wong\n:\nAccording to the United States’ (US') presidential memorandum on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Global Tax Deal dated 20 January 2025, the United States Treasury has 60 days to deliver its recommendations on actions against non-compliance with any tax treaty with the US, or tax rules that are extraterritorial or disproportionately affect American companies. At this stage, it is unclear what measures the US will take and how other jurisdictions will respond. We have prepared for different possible scenarios and will continue to monitor the issue as it develops.\nSustaining economic competitiveness and supporting multilateral rules are not incompatible. A multilateral rules-based order promotes global cooperation and creates a level playing field for businesses and jurisdictions, which are important factors for Singapore to remain competitive. While we cannot control what other countries do, we will continue to enhance our overall business environment and invest in areas, such as upskilling our workforce, growing a vibrant innovation ecosystem, and providing quality infrastructure and connectivity.",

    "title": "Extension of UPLIFT Scholarship to All Eligible Lower-income Students Admitted to Independent Schools",
    "subTitle": null,
    "sectionType": "WANA",
    "content": "24\nMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan\nasked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider expanding the UPLIFT Scholarship to all lower-income students admitted to independent schools whose families meet the eligibility criteria of $4,400 or less monthly gross household income or $1,100 or less monthly per capita income, instead of limiting the scholarship only to those lower-income students admitted to independent schools through Direct School Admissions (DSA) or who have qualified for the Edusave Scholarships for Independent Schools (ESIS).\nMr Chan Chun Sing\n: The UPLIFT Scholarship recognises the outstanding achievements of Singaporean students from lower-income families in Independent Schools (IS) and Specialised Independent Schools (SIS). To be eligible for the scholarship, students must be recipients of the Edusave Scholarship for Independent Schools, or admitted to IS/SISes through Direct School Admissions.\nBesides the UPLIFT Scholarship, the Ministry of Education (MOE) provides financial assistance to Singaporean students from lower-to-middle income households in IS/SISes. Students from families with a monthly gross household income of $3,000 or less, or per capita income of $750 or less, receive 100% subsidies in their fees through the Independent School Bursary, and also receive meal and transport subsidies, as well as free textbooks and school attire. Students from families with gross household income of $3,001 to $4,400 receive significant subsidies on their fees such that they only need to pay the same fees as students in Government schools.\nThe current arrangement allows us to preserve the objectives of the UPLIFT scholarship while ensuring that all lower-income students studying in Independent Schools can have access to substantial financial assistance. MOE reviews our financial assistance schemes regularly to support deserving Singaporean students in their education journey, so that all students can access education opportunities regardless of their backgrounds.",

    "content": "28\nMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan\nasked the Minister for Education (a) whether there are any anonymous channels for staff, students and teachers to report wrongful practice or conduct without fear of retaliation especially for sensitive matters such as discrimination, performance grading and sexual misconduct; and (b) if not, whether the Ministry plans to create one to protect whistleblowers.\nMr Chan Chun Sing\n: Aligned with the Internal Disclosure Policy in the Public Service, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has an established process where staff can report any wrongful or doubtful practices they observe to the Permanent Secretary or the Human Resource Director via written means (for example, email). They may also approach their respective unions for representation. MOE also has clear processes in schools for students to report any wrongdoing to their teachers or school leaders. My response will focus on anonymous reports from staff (including teachers) and students.\nAs a Ministry, we recognise staff or students may feel apprehensive when reporting wrongful practices, as they may fear potential repercussions or negative perceptions. However, to ensure the integrity of the investigation process, we require staff or students providing such reports to provide their identity for the following reasons.\nClarification of details: investigations often involve complex situations that require follow-up questions or additional information from the person making the report. Without knowing the source of the report, it may be difficult or impossible to gather the necessary details to fully understand the issue.\nProtection against false claims: it ensures individual accountability and safeguards the integrity of our reporting system by deterring false or malicious claims.\nSupport: it allows MOE to provide necessary support to protect and provide closure to the staff or student providing the report once the investigation is concluded.\nWhile we do consider anonymous reports based on the specificity and quality of information provided, our ability to thoroughly examine such cases may be constrained.\nWe want to emphasise that regardless of whether a report is made anonymously or openly, we treat the identity of the person making the report and the information provided with confidence. Every effort will be made not to reveal the identity of anyone who makes a report or give evidence in respect of any wrongful practice, to the extent feasible and permissible under the law. In addition, no officer or supervisor should retaliate against the staff or student who made the report in good faith, and those who do so may be subject to disciplinary action. If, however, an allegation is made frivolously, maliciously or for personal gain, disciplinary action may be taken against the staff or student who intentionally made the false allegation.\nIn conclusion, MOE is committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels safe to voice concerns and provide feedback. We continuously strive to create a culture where reporting wrongful practices is seen not as an act of disloyalty, but as a vital contribution to maintain the integrity of our system.",

In the latest survey conducted in 2024, about 90% of respondents said they are willing to play their part in Total Defence. Through regular engagements with schools, businesses and communities, as well as the annual Exercise SG Ready, we seek to maintain a high level of awareness and support among Singaporeans on Total Defence and raise their readiness to deal with crisis scenarios.\nDigital Defence was introduced as the sixth pillar of Total Defence in 2019 to defend ourselves against a range of online and digital threats such as disinformation and scams. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) runs a National Cybersecurity Campaign and conducts talks and workshops for different population segments, focusing on evolving threats and the steps to take to protect themselves. In this year’s Exercise SG Ready, the Singapore Business Federation is organising a phishing exercise to help businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, strengthen their resilience against cyberattacks. The Singapore Institute of Directors has also recently launched a Cyber Resilience Guide to enhance corporate leaders’ cyber readiness.\nTo better protect Singapore’s Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems, the Digital and Intelligence Service and CSA co-organises the Critical Infrastructure Defence Exercise (CIDeX) annually. The exercise brings together industry and Government partners to train for realistic scenarios and stress-test the cyber defence systems of our CIIs. Last year’s exercise involved over 200 cyber defenders from 28 organisations across many sectors, including power and telecommunications.\nMINDEF will continue to work with partners to encourage Singaporeans to raise their digital literacy, develop and maintain good cybersecurity habits, protect sensitive data and guard against scams, fake news and disinformation so as to make the digital domain a safer and more secure space.",

In September 2022, a base NS pay was set at $1,600 per month for all NSmen, regardless of employment status, that is, those who are not employed or are homemakers will receive some financial support for their period of duty.\nThis system of compensation has served us well and should be maintained without extending it to include the income of the spouse. The family structures of NSmen vary and MINDEF recognises that other family members may have to shoulder more family responsibilities when NSmen are on duty.\nThese efforts are recognised through NSmen tax relief, which wives and parents of NSmen are eligible for, as well as NS Home awards, which provides financial benefits to NSmen families for their housing, medical and education needs.\nFinancial support aside, NSmen are typically notified of their call-ups up to six months in advance so that suitable arrangements can be planned early for work, household or caregiving responsibilities. If circumstances of urgent or compassionate nature require NSmen to miss a portion of their NS duties, NSmen can also apply for compassionate leave or time-off.",

    "content": "47\nMr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim\nasked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the measures that the Ministry has taken to encourage more suitable families to act as foster parents; and (b) what are the challenges that inhibit greater enrolment of foster parents.\nMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M\n: The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) seeks to place more children in state care with foster parents as a safe and stable home environment is key to their growth and resilience. We have implemented several measures to encourage more suitable families to foster children.\nFirst, we collaborate with media outlets, community organisations, religious groups and corporate partners to raise awareness of fostering and highlight its positive, lasting impact on children from difficult backgrounds. A key initiative is the Annual Fostering Open House, where prospective foster parents hear first-hand testimonials from foster families and children.\nMSF supports foster parents through our five appointed Fostering Agencies. Foster parents receive training on caring for foster children; receive support and guidance from designated foster care worker; an allowance to help defray out-of-pocket costs; and are eligible for childcare leave to help them balance caregiving responsibilities. In 2022, MSF increased the monthly fostering allowance to $1,100 per child and $1,500 for a child with special needs. Foster children also receive additional subsidies for healthcare, childcare and student care. We have seen an increase in the number of foster families from 595 families in 2021 to 614 families in 2023.\nDespite these efforts, there are challenges in recruiting more foster parents. Common concerns include having sufficient time and resources to meet the needs of a foster child, potential conflicts that may arise between family members and foster children, and the emotional difficulty when children return to their birth families. MSF is addressing these concerns. For example, we developed a Fostering Starter Kit to better prepare parents and other family members to receive the foster child. When it is time for the foster child to part with the family, the transition process is paced and the Foster Care Workers work closely with foster parents to provide counselling and emotional support where necessary.\nThe benefits of being cared for by foster families who provide a secure environment lasts a lifetime for the foster children from difficult backgrounds. We encourage more families to join us as foster parents.",

    "content": "48\nMr Chua Kheng Wee Louis\nasked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can consider introducing an additional road access entry point to the Rivervale Shores estate to address concerns around having only one entry point into the entire estate.\nMr Desmond Lee\n: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) works closely with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to determine the location and number of road access entry points for new Build-To-Order developments. For Rivervale Shores, agencies had explored several options for additional road access entry points, but they were not feasible due to site constraints. The site is bounded by an expressway and the down-ramp portion of a major road. Hence, there is limited road frontage to add another entry point without adversely affecting traffic flow and road safety.\nHDB and LTA have been monitoring the traffic flow at Rivervale Shores closely. We observe that traffic is generally smooth, but a vehicle tailback sometimes builds up at the entry to the estate, typically during the evening peak period. During such times, we seek residents’ understanding that they may take a few more minutes to enter the estate as more residents are returning home at the same time.",

Tamil Language instruction is available in the majority of but not all secondary schools, due to the limited supply of Tamil Language teachers and the low demand in some schools.\nOver the past five years, the Ministry of Education (MOE) received an average of four appeals per year for secondary school transfers due to the school not offering Tamil Language.\nAbout 90% of students who study Tamil Language do so in their secondary school. The rest of the students attend lessons at one of 11 regional school-based centres, or at the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre. These centres offer a rich learning environment with more learners to engage in the use of Tamil Language.\nMOE monitors trends in school transfer appeals related to mother tongue language availability, and factors this into our teacher recruitment and deployment. However, it is not practical to offer Tamil Language in all schools, due to the very small number of Tamil learners in some schools.",

NParks also identifies selected trees for pruning to correct their structure and improve their stability. In addition, NParks intensifies its pruning efforts before the onset of monsoon seasons, particularly along major roads, to reduce the weight of tree branches and mitigate potential risks during periods of stronger winds.\nScheduled tree pruning on expressways and major roads is conducted mainly during off-peak hours both on weekdays and weekends to minimise traffic disruption. NParks’ contractors are also instructed to stop work and leave the site when they observe traffic building up along the roads.\nThe current tree pruning regime does not include night pruning. NParks had previously undertaken a pilot night pruning exercise, and found that even with the use of strong lighting, it was challenging to identify structurally weaker branches in the treetop that needed to be pruned. The inability to see the branches clearly also posed risk to public and workmen safety.",

This includes lift breakdowns, as well as minor issues such as mechanical noise that do not affect lift operations.\nHDB stipulates performance standards based on fault rates in its lift supply contracts for Build-To-Order projects and under the Lift Upgrading Programme. Lift suppliers that fail to meet the required performance standards will be restricted from tendering for HDB’s lift contracts in future. There is no financial penalty. From 2021 to 2024, all HDB lift suppliers met the stipulated performance standards.\nProper servicing and maintenance is equally important in ensuring reliable lift operations over the lifespan of the equipment. The Town Councils are responsible for managing and maintaining the lifts in HDB estates.

Post-disbursement of the grant, Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) conducts regular audits on a sampling basis to ensure compliance to the grant conditions.\nIn the last three years, more than 1,100 approved PSG projects, with a total grant quantum of $8.7 million, were subjected to post-disbursement audits. About 50% of these were from the food and beverage, and retail and services sectors, with the remaining from sectors including manufacturing and engineering, building and construction, and wholesale trade. This breakdown is broadly in line with the PSG application numbers across these sectors.\nAbout 3\n%\nof the projects subjected to post-disbursement audits were assessed to be non-compliant with the grant conditions and required rectification actions, such as a claw back of disbursed grants.\nFor recipients found to be in breach of the grant conditions, EnterpriseSG will withhold or, if disbursement had been made, claw back the grant. EnterpriseSG will also subject these companies to enhanced scrutiny for future applications.\nPre-approved solutions found to be less effective in helping companies achieve productivity improvements will be removed from PSG’s list as part of agencies’ regular review to ensure PSG remains fit-for-purpose.",

As a small low-lying island state, climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore. We are firmly committed to working within a rules-based multilateral system to maintain the momentum of global climate action to ensure Singapore’s environmental sustainability and climate resilience.\nTo meet our climate goals, Singapore has developed an ambitious, forward-looking and diversified suite of measures that will reduce the carbon footprint of our economy and society. To fulfil our obligations under the Paris Agreement, we submitted our 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on 10 February 2025, where we committed to reduce emissions to between 45 and 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2035. This builds on our previous climate commitments and sets us on a trajectory towards net-zero emissions by 2050.\nWe are also partnering the global community, including other governments, corporations, academia, international organisations and non-governmental organisations, through various bilateral and plurilateral mechanisms to develop low-carbon solutions and technologies, support the energy transition, enable green financing, create green economic opportunities, and accelerate implementation through knowledge sharing and collaboration.\nNotwithstanding the announcement by the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, we continue to be open to engaging and partnering like-minded stakeholders to pursue our shared aspirations for a low-carbon, climate resilient society and economy.",

The Singapore Food Agency’s (SFA’s) survey found that the proportion of respondents who recalled seeing the SGFP logos on produce packaging and buying said local produce increased from 58% in 2022 to 75% in 2023.\nWe are unable to attribute the sales of local produce solely to the use of the SGFP logos as there are other measures such as promotions and publicity efforts by suppliers and retailers. We have observed growing industry acceptance of the SGFP logos. As of\nJanuary\n2025, 109 farmers, distributors and retailers have used the logo on produce packaging and in marketing channels, which is more than double the number since it was first launched in 2020.\nSFA has been working with the industry to improve demand offtake for local produce through other initiatives. SFA launched the Farm-To-Table Recognition Programme (FTTRP) in March 2023 to encourage food businesses to procure local produce. As of January 2025, 101 food businesses have been onboarded to the programme. We have incorporated a criterion in Government procurement to give additional points to businesses which have undertaken sustainability initiatives, such as being recognised under the FTTRP. The additional points increase their chances of securing Government catering contracts.\nIn addition, SFA has been working closely with the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprises Federation Limited (SAFEF), as an industry-level supply and demand aggregator, to facilitate long-term commercial contracts between farmers and food businesses. Through the efforts of SAFEF and its partners, some locally grown vegetables and fish are now sold at selected FairPrice outlets under the brand names “SG Farmers’ Market” and “The Straits Fish” respectively. Public response has been encouraging. For example, the sales for xiao bai cai have increased about fivefold while sales for processed fish products such as sliced skinless marine tilapia have increased twofold since the launch in May 2024.\nSFA will continue to explore initiatives to facilitate demand offtake for local produce.",

In the last five years, about 40 schools have discontinued Malay Dance as a CCA. This trend is not unique to Malay Dance but has also been observed across all the ethnic dance CCAs likely due to a change in student preferences and declining student cohort numbers. A number of schools that discontinued ethnic dance CCAs have offered Cultural Dance or International Dance CCAs instead. Overall, about 50 schools started new CCA dance groups in the last five years.\nMalay dance continues to be an important art form which the Ministry of Education (MOE) supports. It is one of the dance categories in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. MOE also engages professional arts groups and practitioners to provide workshops for Malay Dance CCA students and teachers to deepen their appreciation for the art.\nUnder the National Arts Council’s Arts Education Programmes, students get to experience Malay dance and other cultural arts performances in their own schools. Some schools also have Learning for Life Programmes with an emphasis on dance, which exposes their students to a broad repertoire of dance forms including Malay dance.\nMOE also nurtures all students’ appreciation for Malay culture through other art forms. For example, the art curriculum exposes all students to works by Singapore Malay artists. The music curriculum exposes all students to Malay community songs and students who take upper secondary Music learn traditional Malay music and instruments.\nThe Malay Language curriculum also seeks to enhance students’ cultural knowledge and appreciation through immersive programmes like the Mother Tongue Language Fortnight and Language and Cultural Camp. Beyond school, the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee collaborates with community partners to organise interesting programmes for our schools to appreciate Malay language and culture.",

Its annual operating cost is about $18 million, which also accounts for the shared infrastructure of HealthHub and the three cluster apps.\nThe three healthcare clusters maintain their own apps, Health Buddy, NHG Cares App and NUHS App respectively, that offer features customised to their specific facilities and services. These cluster-specific apps collectively add about $3.6 million, or 20% more, in annual operating costs.",

HDB processes all HFE letter applications expeditiously to minimise potential inconvenience to applicants. Applications with a complete set of documents are generally processed within about a week. After receiving their HFE letter, there are ample opportunities for them to buy another flat, either directly from HDB or on the open market. The Ministry of National Development will consider the Member’s suggestion in our regular policy reviews to ensure we continue to meet Singaporeans’ diverse home ownership needs.",

Cool coatings contain additives that reflect the sun’s heat, thus reducing surface heat absorption and emission. For a start, the Government will cover the cost difference incurred by the Town Councils (TCs) from using cool coatings instead of conventional paint.\nSimilar to conventional paint, cool coatings will need to be applied and maintained in compliance with the performance requirements stipulated in the relevant Singapore Standards to ensure optimal functionality. HDB will share more details with the TCs to guide the long-term maintenance of cool coatings, such as when the HDB blocks undergo cyclical repair and redecoration (R&R) works. With the proper application and regular repainting of cool coatings as part of R&R works, cool coatings will remain effective in reducing surface heat absorption and emission.\nThe cool coatings initiative, together with the greenery intensification initiative, is part of HDB’s ongoing efforts to cool HDB towns and mitigate the urban heat island effect. These initiatives contribute to the broader goal of moderating the rise in urban heat under the Resilient Future pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.",

As of 2024, around 75% were able to meet their MediSave obligations in a timely manner. This trend has remained stable over the past five years.\nAmongst the 25% of SEPs who were unable to do so\n1\n, the primary reason for not being able to keep up is financial difficulties. SEPs can choose to make their MediSave contributions through monthly instalments via the CPF website. The CPF Board will work closely with SEPs to work out an affordable instalment plan, based on the SEP’s circumstances. For SEPs who are unable to make any MediSave contributions and are in need of further financial assistance, CPF Board will refer them to other agencies such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development Social Service Offices for financial support.",

The take-up for 2024 is not available yet. The figure of 3,000 cited by the Member was a projection based on data available when the scheme was introduced rather than a target, as the actual number of ex-offender beneficiaries depends on factors such as the number of inmates released in each year.

For grants that may be more closely linked to workforce transformation, businesses are already required to commit to specific worker outcomes, including workforce training, as part of the application process.

Among members who are alive, older members are understandably more likely to have made a nomination. About 86% of members aged 65 and above have made a CPF nomination compared to 36% among those aged from 16 to 64. Of the members aged from 16 to 64 who have not made a nomination, the majority of them are aged 44 years old and below. Unlike for age, we do not observe sharp differentiations in nomination rates among the different races.\nThe CPF Board actively encourages members to make their CPF nominations through sustained outreach efforts to engage various demographics, including the elderly and young adult groups. These efforts include publicity campaigns and roadshows in the heartlands conducted together with partner agencies to raise awareness and encourage adoption of legacy planning tools such as CPF nominations, Lasting Powers of Attorney and Advance Care Plans. The CPF Board also sends personalised notifications to remind members to make or review their CPF nominations, especially after major milestones, such as marriage.\nThe CPF Board has made it more convenient for members to make their nomination through a secure online nomination service. Members who are less digitally savvy can visit our CPF service centres or ServiceSG centres for assistance to make their nomination. With CPF Board’s publicity efforts, more CPF members are making nominations.",
