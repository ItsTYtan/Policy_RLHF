    "content": "1\nEr Dr Lee Bee Wah\nasked\nthe Minister for Transport (a) how are the public transport operators' recent fare increments derived; (b) whether the Ministry has plans to revise the fare increment computation formula; and (c) whether the fares have to be revised annually.\n2\nEr Dr Lee Bee Wah\nasked\nthe Minister for Transport (a) with the sharp drop in oil prices, why are the public transport operators allowed to raise their fares; (b) how much will these operators benefit from the fall in oil prices; and (c) why are these operators not absorbing the 2.8% increase carried over from 2014 given that they are running profitably.\nThe Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew)\n:\nMadam, with your permission, may I take Question Nos 1 and 2 together, please?\nMdm Speaker\n:\nYes, please.\nMr Lui Tuck Yew\n: Mdm Speaker, fare adjustments are guided by the fare adjustment formula and process recommended by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee (FRMC) and were accepted by the Government in 2013. The formula is pegged to changes in the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), Wage Index and Energy Index over the preceding year, less 0.5% for productivity gains. The core CPI and the Wage Index constitute 40% each of the fare formula. The Energy Index, constitute the remaining 20%.\nThe formula broadly reflects the operating cost structure for the public transport operators. The FRMC had also recommended that fare review exercises be conducted annually. This is so that commuters do not have to endure a sudden, large fare adjustment after a few years. This formula and process for fare adjustment is valid for five years, until 2017, and we will review it again thereafter.\nPage: 10\nEr Dr Lee has asked how the recent 2.8% fare increment was derived and why fares were increased despite the sharp drop in oil prices. Er Dr Lee will recall that the full fare adjustment quantum considered by the Public Transport Council (PTC) in the 2013 fare review exercise was actually 6.6%. So, they considered 6.6% for the 2013 fare review exercise. But the PTC was mindful of the impact of a large fare increase on commuters. So, the Council decided to grant only a 3.2% increase, or less than half of the 6.6% increase.\nThe remaining 3.4% was carried over to the fare review exercise for 2014. If we add this 3.4% to the negative 0.6% for the 2014 fare adjustment quantum, we, therefore, get a total fare adjustment quantum of 2.8% for the 2014 fare review exercise. In short, the current fare increase was due to the carry-over from the last exercise and the fall in oil prices in 2013 helped to mitigate this.\nThe continued fall in oil prices in 2014 and the start of this year will generate some cost savings for the transport operators. I should point out, however, that energy costs comprise about 20% of the operating costs for the sector, which is why the Energy Index is only 20% of the fare formula. Other costs, which include salaries for bus drivers and other public transport workers, account for the remaining 80%, and these have continued to experience upward pressure. We also expect operating costs to go up when higher operating standards come into effect from 2016. Notwithstanding this, overall, we are likely to see a negative fare adjustment of about 1% for the fare review exercise in 2015, because the energy costs have come down significantly in 2014. The 2015 fare adjustment that we will do at the end of this year will take into account all the indices of 2014.\nWhen deciding on the fare adjustment, the PTC also has to ensure that the overall public transport system remains financially viable. Er Dr Lee has asked if the public transport operators could absorb the fare increase out of their profits. The fact is that operating buses and trains is not a highly profitable business; far from it.\nIn fact, of all the profits that are generated, roughly about 95% comes from the non-fare business and, at most 5% comes from operating trains and buses. Only in the recent quarters have fare revenue and income crept marginally above costs. Operators, however, need to make profits, for example, to pay for future capital expenditure. In a previous Sitting of this Parliament and in reply to a supplementary question from Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, I mentioned that SMRT has significant future capital commitments from now to 2019, somewhere in the region of $2 billion. We spoke about that. From now to 2019, SMRT has significant future capital commitments in the region of $2 billion. How do we put this $2 billion in context? Well, it is more than three times the cumulative profits that it has made in the last five financial years.\nPage: 11\nThe most important thing is to reassure Members of this House and the commuting public that the Government is committed to ensuring that public transport fares always remain affordable. In this regard, it is worth noting that households have generally been spending a smaller proportion of their income on public transport over the last 10 years – a point that I made in previous Committee of Supply (COS) debates and I will again show this in the coming COS debate in March.\nIn addition, during fare exercises, special attention is paid to vulnerable groups, such as senior citizens, persons with disabilities and lower-wage workers. For this year, fares will remain unchanged for these groups of commuters in the April fare exercise and, generally, the fares for more than 1.1 million commuters will be held constant.\nEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)\n:\nMdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and patience. The fact is that whenever there is a fare review, it attracts a lot of discussion amongst residents. The fact is that the operators are allowed to do business beyond bus and trains, and so, residents expect them to cross-subsidise. The fact is that both SBS Transit and SMRT recently reported huge jumps in profits. If I remember correctly, SBS Transit reported a 27.8% jump in 2014 profit and SMRT a 58.4% increase in Q3 profit.\nTherefore, I would like to ask the Minister to seriously consider the fare review formula. Can this formula include profitability instead of just about operating cost? And can the review of the formula be brought forward, instead of waiting until 2017?\nMr Lui Tuck Yew\n: Mdm Speaker, let me thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for her passion and for championing these various areas. Indeed, there is a certain amount of cross-subsidy that is taking place. Even for SBS Transit, if you have seen the recent results for the whole of FY2014, the buses continue to make a loss. The reason the company remains profitable – and I will come to the profit figures in a while – is because of the other income that they have managed to generate as a result of rentals, commercial operations and so on.\nFor SBS Transit, the profit for the whole year increased from about $11 million-plus to $14 million-plus. In percentage terms, very high; but in terms of absolute numbers, measured against total revenue for the year of about $1 billion, you really see that the profit margin is about 1.5%.\nThe profit margin for SMRT for the past financial year (FY) – their FY ends only in March 2015 and it would not be appropriate for me to speculate what the final quarter's figures are – was 5%. As I had mentioned before, this was largely due to the revenue and profits that they generated from their non-fare business – commercial operations, rentals, taxis and so\nPage: 12\non. SMRT, you may recall, had been losing money on buses for quite a number of years, and it is only in the recent quarter that we have seen a turnaround, helped partly by measures that they have taken as well as the fortuitous situation of a reduction in fuel costs.\nAt the end of the day, the overriding factor that is of importance must be: are our fares affordable, how do our fares compare with those of other countries and cities? Because if you say that you stifle every possibility of a private operator making some profit, improving efficiency, productivity of which there is a dividend that is paid to all commuters through that 0.5% in the fare formula, if you stifle all that, then, ultimately, if it results in an even larger increase in fares, is that of benefit to everybody? That, to me, must be the question that we always ask.\nThat is the question that the PTC looks at very carefully: how do you find a balance between making sure that fares are affordable to commuters and yet ensuring the financial viability of the entire system? If the system ultimately is not financially sustainable, then, over time, the Government and all taxpayers will have to step in to bail it out. The important thing is to make sure it remains financially viable; make sure that our fares are affordable on two counts. One is in comparison with other cities; and two, in comparison with household income and the percentage that households are paying on public transportation.\nEr Dr Lee Bee Wah\n:\nMdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his explanation. I think the overriding factor must be whether there is a justification for an increase in the fare since the reported profit keeps going up. Anybody who invests in the company will know that those operators do not bear high risk because they are providing a basic need; everybody will have to take public transport if they do not own a car. My question is to come back to this fare review formula. Can the profitability of the PTOs be included in the fare review formula: can the change in the formula be effected earlier?\nMr Lui Tuck Yew\n: On the formula, I think it is always useful to allow a formula to run for a number of years. We have had this formula running since 2013. I think it is useful for it to continue until 2017 and we do a review then.\nOn the point that profitability has increased and, therefore, we should not increase fares – I take the Member's point. Thus, the converse must also be true – that when profitability has decreased, even though they are profitable, we must allow them to increase fares.\nSo, the Member's point was that when profitability increases, take that into account and, therefore, do not allow them to increase fares. Now, I see the Member's point: that as long as they are profitable, we cannot allow them to increase fares. Hence, we come back to\nPage: 13\nthe question of what incentive is there for them to be even more efficient and more productive, which ultimately benefits the commuters? If they run a shoddy operation and the business becomes very expensive, ultimately, we all bear the costs. That always is a fundamental.\nThe second point is this: we have mentioned that they have major financial commitments over the next few years, until 2019. I hope that point is not lost. They have commitments to buy trains and all the other projects that we had spoken about in the previous Parliamentary sessions, amounting to about $2 billion.\nTherefore, if you take $2 billion, what does it all mean? It is more than three times the cumulative profits over the most recent five years. More than three times of that. They will have to figure out a way to meet these commitments. They will have to figure out a way to make sure that they remain profitable. But most important of all, they will have to figure out a way to make sure that they continue to improve on reliability and the service that they offer to commuters.\nMs Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member)\n: I would like to ask the Minister: in relation to the provision of public transport, is there not also a duty on the part of the providers to see that as part of their public service? In other words, we should not look at profitability and determine the price of public transport fares, just solely on the basis that the buses may or may not be making profits. The fact is that there is cross-subsidisation within the company, and overall, there is profit. So, should the PTC then not take that into account in determining the fare as well?\nMr Lui Tuck Yew\n: Mdm Speaker, I thank Ms Chia for that supplementary question. Indeed, as I have mentioned earlier, there is a certain amount of cross-subsidy. They do not determine the fares; neither do they determine the standards because, really, at the end of the day, they are almost running like monopolies. The last thing you want for them to do is to be able to determine standards and to determine fares. So, the standards are actually determined by the Land Transport Authority. The fares are determined by the PTC.\nWe have debated extensively in this House about the fare formula that was derived in 2013 after Mr Richard Magnus and his team took an extended amount of time to study this matter carefully, as well as to consult widely, before coming out with the fare formula.\nMy fundamental point is this, which is really an elaboration of what I have mentioned to Er Dr Lee Bee Wah: are we better off if the services are provided by an entity that is run effectively, that is able to keep costs down, that is able to allow us to enjoy relatively low\nPage: 14\nfares, certainly compared to cities around the world? Is that of benefit to us?\nAnd if that is of benefit to us, rather than the converse – which we have seen in a number of cities where they run nationalised systems, not very efficiently done, the cost goes up, they have no handle on that, as well as on other aspects of transportation, ultimately, it is borne by much higher fares in those cities or through a large subsidy from government and taxpayers – if you look at those two possibilities, then, certainly, the former must be more enjoyable and acceptable for Singaporeans. That is the situation that we have today.\nI understand the point and I understand the concern that people always have over profitability of these operators – what is the reasonable amount, what is acceptable and so on. In the past, we also looked at Return On Total Assets (ROTA) but, for the recent fare formula, they have also tried to make sure that we just do not look only at ROTA but try and have a formula that mirrors more closely the operating cost of the two operators and, at the same time, make sure that the productivity improvements that they do make, part of it is given back to commuters as well.\nSo, hopefully, we are trying to arrive at a balance where fares are affordable, in relation to household income and expenditure; fares are affordable in relation to what other cities around the world may be paying for the same level of service or a lower level of service, in fact. And fares are affordable because there are various targeted subsidy schemes that the Government may put in place in order to protect the most vulnerable groups. That is the situation that we are trying to achieve.\nMr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)\n:\nMdm Speaker, a supplementary question. From the Minister's reply, it seems to me that the fare needs to be increased, so that the operator remains profitable and, with that, they can thereby be more efficient. That is the logic, as I understand it. But on the converse, will it be that if the company or the operator is profitable and productive enough, they would have made enough profits and there is no need to increase the fares?\nMr Lui Tuck Yew\n: Mdm Speaker, I am not really sure I follow the argument of Mr Low Thia Khiang. But let me try to interpret what I understand from it: that if they are profitable and productive enough, there is no need; or if they are efficient, productive and profitable enough – sorry, forget about the profitability; if they are efficient and productive enough, there is no need to increase fares.\nTheoretically, yes, except that they do face cost pressures as well. They employ more people, many of them Singaporeans. Their employees do expect wages to go up. You run\nPage: 15\nTown Councils, some of you run companies and so on, and you know the cost pressures that we all come under, and they come under, too.\nMuch as they would like to reach that state of nirvana where efficiency, effectiveness, productivity can overcome all these pressures, the truth is that 80% of their cost largely mirrors the core CPI as well as the wage increases. We know wages have been going up; we know that core CPI has been going up; we have been fortunate that the 20% component, that is, the Energy Index has gone down, using the index for 2013. In the second half, prices have come down, compared to 2012.\nSo, I am not so sure that you can actually escape from the fundamental point that they do, like every other entity, public or private, come under the same cost pressures, the same expectations of their employees to see a reasonable increase in their wages. Driving buses, for example, is a very manpower-intensive kind of operation, together with the maintenance of the buses. Inevitably, they cannot avoid coming under the same pressures which are reflected in the formula that Mr Magnus and his team have derived.",

    "content": "3\nMr Gan Thiam Poh\nasked\nthe Minister for Trade and Industry what is the projected reduction of electricity and gas tariffs in the next six to 12 months in view of the lower price of fuel oil.\nThe Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran)\n(for the Minister for Trade and Industry)\n: Mdm Speaker, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) do not project electricity and town gas tariffs. Both the electricity and town gas tariffs are reviewed by EMA on a quarterly basis to ensure that the tariffs fairly reflect the underlying costs of production, which include fuel costs.\nThe fuel cost component of the electricity tariff is based on the average forward fuel oil and dated Brent prices in the first two and a half months in the preceding quarter and makes up approximately half of the electricity tariff. For town gas, the fuel cost component is based on the average forward fuel oil and naphtha prices for the quarter and makes up about 40% of the tariff.\nThe price of natural gas, which is the main fuel used to produce electricity and town gas in Singapore, has fallen, in tandem with global oil prices. This is because our natural gas contracts are indexed to oil prices, which is the market practice in Asia.\nPage: 16\nIn the recent tariff revisions, the electricity tariff for January to March 2015 decreased by 7.9% to 23.29 cents/per kilowatt hour (kWh), and that is compared to a decrease in fuel cost of 16.4%. As I have mentioned, fuel cost is approximately half the cost of generating electricity. The town gas tariff for February to April 2015 decreased by 8.7% to 19.02 cents/kWh, compared to a decrease in fuel cost of 23.1%.",

    "content": "4\nMr Gerald Giam Yean Song\nasked\nthe Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the economic promotion agencies have set targets for the number of SMEs to be groomed into Globally Competitive Companies within a specific period of time; and (b) if so, what are these targets and time periods.\nThe Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck)\n(for the Minister for Trade and Industry)\n:\nIn its 2010 report, the Economic Strategies Committee set an aspirational goal of having 1,000 Singapore enterprises with revenues above $100 million by 2020. This is an increase of 470 from the base of 530 such enterprises in 2007. The goal of reaching 1,000 such companies reflects the objective of developing a strong base of globally competitive companies to create a vibrant corporate ecosystem in Singapore and grow the external wing of our economy.\nMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)\n:\nI thank the Minister of State for the reply. I just wanted to ask the Minister of State what are the current schemes that the Government is putting in place in order to achieve this target of 1,000 companies and are there any benchmarks on these schemes to achieve those targets?\nMr Teo Ser Luck\n: For companies to grow to $100 million of revenue in size, they have to do a few things: expanding their base revenue and creating new revenue streams. At the same time, they have to look at the type of sectors they are in and which kind of markets they should target, overseas especially, because Singapore, being a smaller market, may not be sufficient for them to grow to that certain size.\nThere are a few schemes through which we help them. First is that they have to strengthen their company, especially the internal processes and new technologies, so that it is scalable for the companies to grow to a large size of $100 million. We have a Capability Development Fund that helps them to tap on to apply technology, human capital development and also productivity improvements. Today, there are more than 1,000 companies or enterprises that tap on these funds. We hope that more companies can come forward to tap on these funds. This is for the internal processes.\nPage: 17\nThe other scheme to help them is to expand their revenue base of going international, that is, internationalisation, going overseas and all that. IE Singapore organises several trade missions where we bring companies overseas to assess the market. But at the same time, for companies that cannot go for these overseas trips or are unable to, say, set up base overseas, we have a scheme that helps them to assess the market through information and resources that we have gathered there, and then provide them with the data when they are locally based here.\nFor example, schemes like the Market Readiness Assistance, provide a broad-based informational, advisory and financial support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in order to assess whether they should go international. Secondly, of course, we have the Global Company Partnership Scheme. We identify some potential good companies and, I would not say handhold them, but we go in-depth into their operations and work together with them to assess opportunities overseas and create revenue streams.\nTo date, we have assisted more than 27,000 companies, of which 80% are SMEs, to internationalise, and this is an increase of 16,000 companies in 2013. We can see that more and more companies are going overseas. Hopefully, we can reach our target of 1,000 companies by 2020.",

    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "5\nMr Ang Wei Neng\nasked\nthe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the additional measures that the Police are embarking on, including co-operation with other Government agencies, to prevent further escalation of crimes involving e-commerce; and (b) how many cheating cases involving e-commerce have been solved in 2012, 2013 and 2014.\nThe Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran)\n(for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs)\n: Mdm Speaker, there were 238 reported cases of cheating involving e-commerce in 2012, 510 cases in 2013, and 1,659 cases in 2014. The sharp increase reflects the growth of online shopping transactions and greater awareness and reporting of such crimes.\nFrom 2012 to 2014, 132 arrests were made in connection with such cases. However, many perpetrators are based overseas, making it harder for the Police to track them down. Investigations also take more time given the transboundary nature of such crimes and the Police need to work closely with their international counterparts.\nAs more people are making purchases online, criminals will attempt to capitalise on this trend. Police will continue to educate consumers to beware of such scams when they do\nPage: 18\nonline shopping. For example, in November 2014, the National Crime Prevention Council and the Police launched a nationwide Anti-Scam Public Education Campaign to raise public awareness of common scams in Singapore. This includes a new website, advertisements and other materials that explain how scams are carried out.\nThe Police are also working closely with partners, such as the Media Development Authority, Monetary Authority of Singapore, major financial institutions and online shopping sites, to broaden efforts to educate consumers about online scams.\nMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)\n:\nI thank the Second Minister for the comprehensive reply. The crime rate involving e-commerce has increased by more than 200% in 2014 – 225% to be exact – and it is a cause for concern. And the problem, as the Second Minister said, is compounded by the low solving rate of e-commerce crime.\nI had, last year, in September, suggested that the Police consider setting up a dedicated cybercrime unit so that they can really look at the different aspects of cybercrime, get the relevant skillsets and also look at the transboundary kind of situation. But it did not appear to Senior Minister of State Masagos at that time to take this suggestion seriously. So, if the e-commerce crime rate has increased so rapidly, would MHA consider this suggestion again?\nMr S Iswaran\n:\nMadam, we share the Member's concern over the rising rate of such cybercrimes. The Police have been taking a series of measures. As I mentioned, one aspect of them pertains to the collaboration with other Government agencies as well as the transaction or service providers and also conducting broader education campaigns in order to raise awareness.\nPolice are also constantly upgrading their cyber capabilities and work closely with international partners and experts in order to track down persons who use the Internet to commit crimes. The nature of this crime is such that it is somewhat elusive at times, given the nature of the medium and the transboundary nature of the transactions. But having said that, there is increasing collaboration and the Police have got specific resources allocated for this purpose. And I would add that the Police are also working with Interpol's new Global Complex for Innovation, which is located in Singapore. One aspect of this Complex is a digital crime centre that supports digital forensic and develops new solutions to tackle cybercrime.\nSo, I want to assure the Member and, indeed, all Members of the House, that this is something that is taken seriously. The Police have allocated specific resources, maybe not a division, as suggested by the Member, but there have been allocated resources and specialties developed, and there is collaboration with international bodies as well as the\nPage: 19\nInterpol centre in Singapore.",

It is also one that Mr Seng Han Thong had separately raised to me earlier. As part of the 2014 Fare Review Exercise, the two public transport operators will contribute $13.5 million to the Public Transport Fund. We intend to use up to $7.5 million from this Fund to provide 250,000 Public Transport Vouchers of $30 value to needy families for this fare exercise.\nThe Government also has plans for the remaining amount in the Public Transport Fund and we will announce the details when we are ready to do so.\nMr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol)\n:\nI thank the Minister for the positive reply. I think we are all aware that Singapore public transport is heavily subsidised by the Government. My thinking is that since it is heavily subsidised, and actually there are profits made by the transport companies and there are also savings there, would the Ministry perhaps consider making all Singaporeans as shareholders of these public transport companies, so that they get to share in the savings, especially for this year, which is the 50th year of Singapore's Independence (SG50)?\nI think we had done that in the past via the issuing of Singtel Special Shares. Perhaps, the Government may consider that to celebrate SG50 and to thank all Singaporeans for their support this year, the understanding that they have shown, their support of the transport operators, especially in the past two years, and for the inconvenience that some of them have to go through.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMr Gan, can you please put your question?\nMr Gan Thiam Poh\n:\nOkay. Thank you.\nMr Lui Tuck Yew\n:\nMdm Speaker, let me thank the Member for his suggestion which is to make all Singaporeans shareholders in the company. I am afraid that this is something that goes beyond the ambit of the Ministry of Transport, but I will raise this matter to the\nPage: 20\nMinister for Finance and let him consider this in his own good time.",

Of these bookings, about 10,000, or 9% of the applicants, did not complete the purchase.\nThe number of appeals to delay key collection totalled about 460: 30 in 2010, followed by 50 in 2011; 90 each in 2012 and 2013; and 200 in 2014. The increase in appeals corresponded with the increase in the number of flats completed over the years.\nOut of the 460 appeals, about 180 appeals were from first-timer applicants. Generally, 4- and 5-room flat types had more appeals from first-timers, while the smaller flat types had more appeals from second-timer applicants. About three in four of them have since collected the keys.\nMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)\n:\nI thank the Minister of State for the reply. I was asking about the percentage and number of applicants who gave up their flats from 2010 to 2014, broken down by year, to see whether there is an increasing trend of residents who are not able to collect their keys due to financial problems, that is, those who have booked the flat but could not collect the keys because of financial problems.\nMr Desmond Lee\n:\nMadam, for the figures as of now, if the Member could file a written request, we could put up a table for him. But my sense is that HDB will look at the individual circumstances of the applicants.

    "content": "8\nMr Ang Wei Neng\nasked\nthe Minister for National Development in 2013 and 2014 (a) what is the number of Singaporeans and Permanent Residents who have appealed to HDB to purchase a HDB flat whilst holding (i) private property in Singapore (ii) overseas property;\nPage: 21\nand (b) how many of them have been successful in their appeals.\nThe Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee)\n(for the Minister for National Development)\n:\nMadam, in 2013 and 2014, a total of 1,587 Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents appealed to buy a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat while holding on to their private property. Among them, 486 owned a local private property, while 1,101 owned an overseas private property. Six hundred and six of the appeals were approved. All approved cases were appeals from Singapore Citizens.\nMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)\n:\nI thank the Minister of State for the reply. For those appeal cases involving Singapore Citizens owning overseas properties and yet could buy an HDB flat, what are the criteria that HDB uses to evaluate these appeals?\nMr Desmond Lee\n:\nMdm Speaker, HDB will assess each appeal on a case-by-case basis. For example, if a resident was under extenuating circumstances, such as financial hardship, and needed to buy an HDB flat while the private property was undergoing mortgage sale, this could be some of the circumstances that we will look into. But each case is different. We assess them individually.",

    "content": "9\nMr David Ong\nasked\nthe Minister for Transport (a) what are the guidelines for erecting covered pedestrian overhead bridges; and (b) whether the Ministry will review these guidelines for existing pedestrian overhead bridges that span across major expressways connecting residential estates to make it more convenient for residents.\nThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)\n(for the Minister for Transport)\n:\nMdm Speaker, 84% of pedestrian overhead bridges are covered. Over time, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) plans to provide cover for the rest, including those that span across expressways. Those that have higher pedestrian usage and are connected to a transport node or facility will be accorded higher priority.\nMr David Ong (Jurong)\n: Madam, a couple of supplementary questions. Working towards an enhanced pedestrian walking experience, would the Ministry consider incorporating standard shelters across all its overhead bridges connecting housing precincts other than meeting the criteria of connecting transport nodes, schools or even public institutions? Because I have two such bridges across the PIE in Bukit Batok for which many residents have made appeals. So, I hope that the Ministry can consider that.\nPage: 22\nThe second question: since we are on the issue of overhead bridges, can the Ministry also update us on the status of LTA's efforts in making our overhead bridges more accessible to our elderly, wheel-chair bound commuters, cyclists and parents with prams?\nAssoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim\n: Madam, I would like to thank the Member for the questions. Essentially, as I have mentioned earlier, we would cover all the overhead bridges and we would give priority to those which have higher pedestrian flow as well as those which are connected to the Walk2Ride programme or are within 400 metres of a rail station. With regard to the standard, I would like to clarify what is meant by \"standard\".\nSecondly, it is about the facilities for the elderly. In fact, we have started a long while ago to provide such facilities and we are continuing our efforts to do so, as part of these plans for an ageing society. It is not only done by LTA or the Ministry of Transport; it is an inter-Ministry effort. And I would like to assure the Member that it is something that is a high priority on our agenda as part of the process of providing for an inclusive society.\nMaybe the Member could share with me about the \"standard\" that he mentioned.\nMr David Ong\n:\nMadam, allow me to clarify. The \"standard\" which I referred to is to provide shorter pedestrian overhead bridges (POBs), that is, for any POB that connects a housing estate to another housing estate. I have two POBs in Bukit Batok that are not covered yet. I also know that one of the criteria is to have high pedestrian traffic. But for some bridges, they do not have high traffic but they do give tremendous convenience to our residents who want to connect from one estate to another estate.\nAssoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim\n:\nAgain, I would like to reiterate that we will cover all POBs over time. With regard to his covered linkways, maybe if he could share the specific details with me, I am sure our staff at LTA will work closely with him with regard to the POBs in question. So, I look forward to receiving details from him.",

The ratio of morning peak commuters to pre-peak commuters heading to the city has been sustained at around 2.1, compared to 2.7 prior to the trial. This translates to a 7%-8% shift since the trial started. A survey by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) showed that the lack\nPage: 23\nof flexible work arrangements may be a reason why the shift has not been more pronounced.\nTo address this, we have been working with employers in the city through the Travel Smart programme since July last year.

    "content": "[(proc text) Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [12 February 2015] (proc text)]\n\"That this Parliament:\n(i) notes with concern the Auditor-General's Report on the Audit of Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC) (Paper Misc 1 of 2015), specifically its findings on:\n(a) the deficiencies in AHPETC's financial and accounting systems, record-keeping and safeguards;\n(b) the uncertain accuracy and reliability of AHPETC's accounts;\n(c) the lack of proper disclosure and oversight by AHPETC's Town Councillors, especially over related-party transactions and conflicts of interest; and\n(d) the risk that AHPETC has not properly managed and spent public funds;\n(ii) calls on all Town Councils to uphold high standards of accounting, reporting and corporate governance so as to safeguard residents' interests; and\n(iii) supports strengthening the legislative framework for Town Councils, in order to hold those responsible for their good management to proper account. – [Minister for National Development].\"\n[(proc text) Question again proposed. (proc text)]\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMinister Shanmugam.\n2.15 pm\nThe Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)\n:  Mdm Speaker, I said that I would come back to clarify if necessary on Annex 3. Ms Lim asked me yesterday whether the table, which I circulated showing AHPETC paying FMSS significantly more per unit, is correct. I have verified the rates in the table that I gave, in Annex 3, are correct. These are the rates in the management agency contracts that the Town Councils have signed with their respective\nPage: 25\nManaging Agents.\nAHPETC is the only Town Council where the Managing Agent charges differential rates for residential and commercial units. Some Town Councils, in the past, charged differential rates, but all the Managing Agents have since done away with those and applied a fixed rate for both. Ms Lim may have been mistaken and confused the Managing Agent rates with the service and conservancy charges (S&CCs) paid by commercial units which may differ from the S&CCs paid by residential units.\nSo, the calculation that I have put out is correct and, on a weighted average basis, AHPETC pays $1.6 million more, compared with other Town Councils. Thank you.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMs Sylvia Lim, you wish to make a clarification?\nMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)\n:\nYes, Madam, and also to clarify to what the Minister has just clarified, if I could.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nYes, not a speech, please, Ms Lim.\nMs Sylvia Lim\n:\nNo.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nJust a clarification.\nMs Sylvia Lim\n:\nYes, Mdm Speaker. I would like to respond to what the Minister mentioned. I was not confused about whether it was S&CC rates or Managing Agent rates. My response was based on documents that we had seen from PAP Town Council Managing Agents stating very specifically that they charged a higher rate for commercial units compared to residential units. So, that is my clarification.\nMadam, may I proceed to clarify something I said in my speech yesterday?\nMdm Speaker\n:\nYes, please.\nMs Sylvia Lim\n:\nYesterday, in response to the Minister's mention of cyclical information reports being late from AHPETC, I said that in terms of replacing lift parts, the ropes and sheaves were on time and that lift batteries were being scheduled in accordance with the schedule by the Ministry of National Development (MND). What I should have said was that the replacement of the ropes and sheaves was on schedule, and that the replacement of lift\nPage: 26\nbatteries is being done in accordance with the schedule that we have given to MND.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMr Liang Eng Hwa.\n2.18 pm\nMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)\n: Mdm Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to join in the debate.\nWhat was revealed in the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) report went beyond what many had imagined. It is like reading an extreme negative case study in a text book on corporate governance. The only difference is that this is real. It is a live example and, sadly, something that will bring disrepute to many of our elected Members here.\nGlaring lapses that are most disturbing to me and many others are the mismanagement of the Sinking Funds, the disregard for the governance of related party transactions and conflict of interest, the shocking lack of internal control, the mishandling of S&CC arrears and several instances of amounts collected and paid out that were not properly recorded, to name a few.\nIt gave the impression of a house in disarray and also, critically, the absence of leadership to ensure governance, transparency and accountability.\nThe financial affairs for the Town Council were in such a shambles that both AGO and, earlier, the AHPETC independent auditors, were unable to draw any meaningful opinion on the Town Council's state of affairs and transactions. AGO said that due to the inadequacies in the accounting system and procedures, the financial statements prepared were inaccurate and not reliable. And, hence, they were unable to establish if public funds were properly spent, accounted for and managed.\nAHPETC's independent auditor had not once but twice and, in fact, two years in a row, stated that they were not able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide the basis for an audit opinion. In the 2012/2013 report, its independent auditor issued a qualified opinion stating 13 issues of concern over the Town Council's account.\nI know this was talked about at length yesterday by Minister Khaw and Minister Shanmugam, but it is worth reiterating again to remind all in this Chamber of the seriousness.\nPage: 27\nQualified opinions from independent auditors are about the most disapproving opinion you can get from an auditor. And it usually suggests material discrepancies that compromise the accuracy and integrity of the financial statements. Any companies receiving a qualified opinion would almost drop everything to immediately address the issues raised and would expeditiously act to rectify the concerns raised as well. However, in the case of AHPETC, its response to the adverse audit report was surprisingly one of sloppiness and lack of urgency, with a number of audit issues not rectified thereafter.\nThe public has no access to the Town Council's state of finances and processes. Hence, they will have to depend on independently audited statements to know if things are in order. In the last three years, the public and Parliament were denied the right as there were no credible and unqualified financial reports available that can be used as a basis to scrutinise them.\nSo, yesterday, Ms Sylvia Lim told the House that many committees had been formed by the Town Council, and of how she chaired her chairman's committee meetings, the various measures she has put in place, the Members of Parliament's estate visits. They were all mentioned in the annex that she presented. Well, form without substance is meaningless. What really matters to the public are results and desired outcomes, in the sense that funds are well-spent and accounted for. Clearly, in the case of AHPETC, the outcomes are a let-down.\nThe Town Council was set up to manage the Housing and Development Board (HDB) estates and entrusted with the responsibility to manage very large sums of public money, money from residents in the form of S&CC and from the Government in the form of grants from MND.\nTown Councils are not part of the Singapore Public Service. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance (MOF)'s Instruction Manual (IM) does not apply here. Instead, the Town Councils Act was crafted to give the Town Councils financial autonomy and devolved powers to manage their own businesses, including procurement and financial management. The elected Members of Parliament of the Town Councils are empowered to appoint key appointment holders and council members.\nClearly, there are significant powers and autonomy given to the Town Councils. But it does come with accountability and responsibility as well.\nGiven the political nature of Town Councils, the issue of governance and accountability should rightly be dealt with in Parliament, the highest political institution of the land. It is the duty of every one of us here in this House to resolutely uphold the high standards of\nPage: 28\ngovernance in Town Councils, certainly no worse standards than any companies or charitable organisations. We must not let any errant practices erode public confidence and trust in the integrity of the finances of Town Councils. We, the elected representatives, are the guardians of governance, transparency and accountability. And it cannot be just form without substance, talk without actions.\nThe debate in this House is also necessary because, in the area of financial management, payments and procurement procedures and processes, it is not often obvious to the general public as to whether public monies are properly managed and clearly accounted for.\nMdm Speaker, I want to record my concerns with regard to the lapses in the Sinking Fund raised by AGO.\nIn AGO's report, it flagged that AHPETC had failed to make the required transfers of the conservancy and service fees and the Government grants into the sinking fund accounts for the last three quarters of FY2011/2012, in non-compliance with the Town Councils Financial Rules. It later transferred a $2.7 million and an additional amount of $1.2 million only after being queried by AGO.\nMonies in the sinking fund are set aside for future cyclical maintenance, such as repainting of common areas, replacing water tanks and pipes, re-roofing and electrical rewiring, upgrading of lifts, which is a costly item, replacing rubbish chutes and water pumps and so on. These are the real things that need to happen with money from the Sinking Fund.\nThe consequences of having insufficient money in the Sinking Fund are that many of these essential maintenance works may not be done and, hence, resulting in poorer living conditions, living environment, frequent breakdowns and repair disruptions and even compromising the safety of residents. These consequences may not be seen in the initial few years but, as the estates ages, residents will soon be at the short end of the stick and suffering. And the Town Council may have to levy more S&CC to pay for the maintenance costs. And, of course, there is also this risk of inflation that you have to take into consideration.\nIt is for this reason that Sinking Funds are segregated and ring-fenced so that Town Councils cannot dip into these funds for other operating and routine uses. If there are no regular and diligent contributions to the Sinking Fund, it will soon run out of money and there will be no cyclical maintenance to talk about.\nLike the reserves that the country builds up over the years for our long-term security, the accumulation and disciplined contribution to the Sinking Fund are at the core of the type\nPage: 29\nof government that we want in Singapore, which is, to do whatever is right and in the long-term good of Singapore and our people. In contrast, mismanagement and the wrong use of Sinking Funds tell a different set of value system – that of a short-sighted and populist government.\nI am very concerned that AHPETC took such a lax attitude towards the Sinking Fund. If AGO had not pointed out this lapse, it is only common sense to expect that the Town Council Sinking Fund would soon be running short of funds to maintain the estates. Then, we will see the estate deteriorating and the quality of life worsening for the residents.\nAlso of particular concern is another related lapse pointed out by AGO with regard to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) input tax claimed from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). In this case, Sinking Fund expenditures were paid from the Sinking Fund's bank accounts for two financial years. However, the two amounts claimed – $643,000 and $888,000 – were not returned to the Sinking Fund and ended up in the operating account. This, again, will deplete the Sinking Funds which are for longer-term use. Instead, the funds were transferred to the operating account which is for short-term use.\nIn another instance, maturing deposits of $5.49 million intended for the Sinking Fund were not credited into the Sinking Fund bank account. Again, it went into the operating fund account. According to the AGO's report, even after restoring the full amount, the Sinking Fund is still short of the missing $490,000.\nThese and other lapses related to the Sinking Fund pointed out by the AGO will seriously undermine the adequacy and sufficiency of the Sinking Fund, and this is not unacceptable.\nThe Workers' Party (WP) is not new in running a Town Council, having run Hougang Town Council for more than 20 years. Hence, it surprised me why AHPETC did not transfer the money, as required, to the Sinking Fund bank accounts. It is not about whether you have a good IT software system or not. It is simply about whether the management is conscious of the importance of the Sinking Fund and the presence of mind to see that this is adhered to.\nThe previous People's Action Party (PAP)-run Town Council for Aljunied left a healthy reserve of about $90 million to the current WP-run Town Council. It is only right that the current leadership of the Town Council ensured that the long-term funding needs of the Town Council are safeguarded and the hard-earned monies of the residents are properly and fairly spent.\nPage: 30\nThe AGO's report also pointed out the serious conflict of interest issues and the disregard for related party transactions, which were well-covered by Minister Shanmugam and Minister Khaw yesterday.\nAgain, I want to record my serious concern over this situation where the \"Group of Four\" or the \"Gang of Four\" sit as key appointment holders of AHPETC and yet are also the owners and directors of the company that render for-profit services to the Town Council. And most amazingly, notwithstanding the related party transactions and the fit and proper issues, they were given the job of certifying work done and approving cheque payments from the Town Council to their own company.\nSo, again, the common sense question is: how can that be allowed to be passed by the Councillors of the Town Council? Are the stewards of the Town Council not supposed to discharge their fiduciary duties and responsibilities?\nAgain, were these lapses due to ignorance, or were they incompetent? Or is it a case of the Town Council taking advantage of the financial autonomy granted to the Town Councils?\nIt is also amazing to see how AHPETC has flip-flopped and reported wide swings in the S&CC arrears numbers. The arrears report to MND and to AHPETC's Finance and Investment Committee was unreliable and not aligned. More than three years into running the Town Council, AHPETC still does not have a system that can generate reliable arrears data. This is unsustainable and unfair to residents who duly pay their S&CC.\nMdm Speaker, we are all really shocked and at the same time saddened to read observations in the AGO report and the AHPETC's Independent Auditor's report. The systemic breakdown of internal controls as well as the messiness and the sloppiness in the way the Town Council operated are the consequences of incompetent management, to say the least.\nAs of now, we are not even sure if the financial statements tabled are correct and reflect the true state of affairs at AHPETC. In other words, we do not know what we do not know. Listening to the speeches of the WP Members of Parliament yesterday, I am not sure if they have come to grips with these serious lapses.\nLast night, at a coffee shop dinner, an auditor friend of mine told me an interesting comment. He said, \"Why is the PAP doing WP a favour by helping them to get their house in order, and yet being accused of bullying the WP?\" He said that the way things are going, the Town Council is clearly down on a slippery slope and, in no time it will turn into a monster\nPage: 31\nand collapse on its own weight.\nSo, I had to explain to him that as a responsible political party, we cannot allow such poor management of public funds and public money to occur and impacting the lives of our citizens, even if it means hurting us politically, and also the perception that the PAP bullies WP. In any case, we are more concerned whether WP is bullying their own residents with these malpractices. From the numbers that Minister K Shanmugam just clarified, obviously the Managing Agent is charging the Town Council a lot more than the other Town Councils, and, from the other numbers that have been reviewed, it is quite clear that FMSS has short-changed the Town Council. In other words, the Town Council paid more and the residents got less.\nMdm Speaker, what we have learnt from the AGO report is far from the best practices that we expected from a political-linked organisation like Town Councils, funded by public money and run by elected Members. These are worst practices that may not even find its place in a Third World parliament.\nFinally, I want to quote a comment made by Mr Zulkifli Baharudin in Wednesday's Straits Times. He said, \"It shouldn't be that if you're from a smaller party, your standards are lower. If someone votes for opposition, it is because he thinks they can do a better job. You cannot join politics and say that you are inexperienced.\"\nOur politics must not be about accepting mediocre performance and sub-standard practices. Singaporeans deserve better. AHPETC has to rectify these serious shortcomings and accurately restate and present their financials expeditiously.\nMadam, I support the Motion in the name of the National Development Minister. Given the seriousness of the issue, at the time of voting, and with your consent, I would like to call for a Division.\n2.33 pm\nMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang)\n: Mdm Speaker, we all know what the AGO is known for and the values they represent. In every report that came out of AGO since time immemorial, entities under its scrutiny had to go through a baptism of fire whenever the AGO came knocking. I have full respect for their work.\nOver the years, the AGO has found sad instances of over payments, payments without evidence that goods and services were delivered, duplicate payments and, in one instance,\nPage: 32\namounting to $18.6 million, and so on in many Ministries and Organs of State it audited.\nOne agency was found to have called for a quotation instead of a tender for a project that exceeded $70,000 in the 2010/2011 AGO report. Another agency was cited to have issued purchase orders to the term contractor only after the contractor has started the work.\nAGO also revealed that 10 Statutory Boards did not present their FY2006/2007 annual reports to Parliament within the six-month time frame and three of these boards had also been late the previous two years. One of them did not even present its audited financial statements to Parliament for the previous two financial years.\nAwarding the contract to the sole tenderer despite the offer not meeting technical requirements specified in the tender and paying more than the contract price for extension of the contract were all flagged. Even the agencies under MND were cited for over-payment, late payment, mistaken use of waiver of competition.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs was cited for not having complied with Government procurement principles of transparency, open and fair competition and value for money when an overseas mission was audited.\nThe Public Service Division was also flagged for informing a bidder that it had secured a contract worth $455,000, 13 days before the Tender Board made the award decision.\nSome of these lapses were small in financial values while others were serious and the list goes on. Like what the Ministers said yesterday, in some countries, the CEO would have taken a deep bow, apologised, and resigned, but I guess this is not in our culture.\nMadam, AHPETC is also found by AGO to have erred in some of these areas and I am certain AHPETC will not be the last as well because good corporate governance is a work in progress.\nThe WP takes the AGO findings very seriously. We have acknowledged our shortcomings in certain areas as well as defended our actions in others. On any other given day, this report may read like a typical AGO report on any entity under audit but, today, the spotlight is on AHPETC and we will explain the issues to the public.\nFirst, I would like to specifically address one of the major lapses mentioned by AGO under para 3.2(c) of the main report which states that AHPETC does not have \"a system to monitor arrears of service and conservancy charges accurately and hence there is no\nPage: 33\nassurance that arrears are properly managed.\"\nWe have explained to AGO that AHPETC does have a system to track every financial transaction in a resident's account, including HDB grants, monthly S&CC payments, penalties, legal costs, and interests, if any, dating back to 1996 if the residents are from Hougang.\nWe have also explained how these S&CC payments are collected and uploaded into our financial and accounting system. Every transaction via cash, credit card, cheque, NETS, Internet banking and inter-bank GIRO is identified and posted into the respective residents' record in the Accounts Receivable and General Ledger at the end of the day or whenever the collection agencies inform us. This has allowed AHPETC to monitor the arrears situation of an individual account \"live\", up to date and on demand.\nAHPETC is able to account to residents as to whether they have paid their S&CC or whether they are in arrears, if they were to enquire at the any of our branches across our town.\nMadam, what AHPETC does not have is a programme to generate aggregated S&CC data in the format requested by MND and to monitor them in that specific format. The computer system currently in use at AHPETC was an upscaled version of the system from Hougang Single Member Constituency (SMC) and it was put into operation within a short span of one month. A lot of the features required to handle the operation of a Group Representation Constituency (GRC) were not implemented then.\nAs we have mentioned in our media release, all reports submitted to MND up to April 2013 were prepared by staff based on data generated by the IT system and extracted through manual sorting and counting. AHPETC also acknowledges that this manual process is not ideal and efficient as the data set is huge. It is also tedious and subject to reporting and human errors.\nAHPETC has made incremental improvements to the computer system over the years. Our system may be rudimentary in features compared to what was available before 2011, but it is certainly robust in keeping a reliable database. We took time to have the data and process reviewed internally and externally before we released our S&CC arrears rate of 5.66% as at 30 September 2014 a few weeks ago. In short, we were not evasive when we said we would address the issue in due course. We will work towards providing timely data to MND in the coming weeks, albeit not in the format the Ministry requires, but, nonetheless, relevant enough to take a snapshot of the arrears situation at AHPETC.\nPage: 34\nNext, I want to highlight the challenging environment AHPETC is working in, some of which relate to the 13 points of disclaimers highlighted by the auditors of AHPETC for FY2012/2013.\nIn Part 1 of the AGO report under one of the disclaimers on Receivables from Sundry Debtors, AGO revealed that AHPETC did not monitor and take timely follow-up action on its receivables.\nIn para 2.34 of the report, it was stated that most of the outstanding receivables as at 1 July 2014 were amounts due from HDB and the National Environment Agency (NEA). While there were invoices under dispute, there were also instances where HDB was reviewing claims dating back to May and November 2012.\nIn subsection (ii) of the same para, NEA rejected four invoices from AHPETC because they were wrongly sent to one of the regional offices. NEA further explained that by the time the invoices were received by the relevant division, the period provided for payments or the credit period, had lapsed and NEA was unable to process the invoices for payment. The agency then requested AHPETC to re-issue the four invoices.\nMadam, invoices do not carry expiry dates. The 30-day credit term listed on an invoice is to let the debtors know that they have to pay within the stipulated period or the creditors will reserve the right to impose penalties. It is common to replace a missing invoice under the same invoice number and date, or to re-issue an invoice due to amendments but to request for new invoices due to expired credit terms is highly unconventional.\nTo void an invoice needs justification. Is it right to do that just so an agency can be seen to be prompt in making payments on paper?\nUnder the same report for Disclaimer 6(a) on page 23, AGO also revealed that AHPETC does have a standard operating procedure (SOP) for non-routine works, contrary to what the previous auditor had claimed. AGO was of the opinion that AHPETC should stipulate a timeline for verification works to be done by property officers after job sheets were received in the SOP, not that AHPETC does not have an SOP.\nNext, I would like to highlight what my colleague, Ms Sylvia Lim, said yesterday on the oversight of payments.\nThe headline in Lianhe Wanbao, \"Town Council Secretary and GM pay their own company $6.6 million\", is very mischievous. Out of the $6.6 million, $6.4 million or 96% is related to agreed monthly sums for services provided by the Managing Agent and Essential\nPage: 35\nMaintenance Service Unit under contracts approved by the Town Council.\nThese are necessary recurring payments for critical services to keep our town running, or else rubbish will pile up three-storey high and lives will be endangered if residents are trapped in the lifts with no rescue effort carried out in the shortest possible time.\nOur Managing Agent cannot make payments to themselves for the above services without the Chairman or one of the Vice Chairmen to co-sign the cheque, bearing in mind that, at the same time, there are oversight committees to ensure work is done.\nWe monitor calls, complaints, conservancy issues, electrical issues, lift issues, customer services issues and so on across our town and by divisions. Checks are done monthly at our Estate and Community Liaison Committee (ECLC) meetings and quarterly Town Council meetings. So, these are not payments for nothing or for unknown services or work done.\nLast, I wish to touch on safeguarding public funds. It is a waste of public funds for an incoming administration to develop a new computer system that does essentially the same functions as the previous system, which was also developed with public funds.\nI understand, in the old days, HDB used to provide Town Councils with a centralised computer system. It makes perfect sense since Town Councils are set up to manage only HDB estates and the common areas. Who else would have the latest data on the number of flats in an estate, the types of flats, the residency status of the tenants, the amount of grant each flat should receive, when to start collecting S&CC and whether the unit is rented out whole or partial? All this information affects S&CCs and grants.\nAnd such systems are not cheap to develop. The old system at Aljunied Town Council cost over $20 million in hardware and software split amongst other PAP Town Councils. AHPETC has spent over half a million dollars just to replicate the old system and what the old system could do, and we still have some way to go. Is that not a waste of resources and public funds? Setting up a centralised computer system will certainly safeguard residents' interest and money, no doubt.\nMadam, there are many observations made in the AGO report. But at the end of it all, the buck stops at AHPETC. I cannot remember if any Minister had ordered any audit on any Ministry or Organ of State in recent times due to disclaimers or adverse opinions expressed by its auditors. But nonetheless, AHPETC has cooperated in this audit and will take lessons from the findings in the spirit of public accountability and good corporate governance.\nPage: 36\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMrs Josephine Teo.\n2.46 pm\nThe Senior Minister of State for Finance and Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo)\n: Mdm Speaker, I would like to seek a clarification from the Member, Mr Png.\nMr Png had compared AGO's report of its audit on AHPETC to the findings that the AGO makes during its annual audit of Government agencies. But I would like to ask, in relation to the conclusion that it drew from its audit of AHPETC, and I quote from its report, \"The AGO concluded that unless the weaknesses are addressed, there can be no assurance that AHPETC's financial statements are accurate and reliable and that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed.\"\nI would like to seek a clarification from the Member whether he is aware of any other audit conducted by AGO of a Government Ministry, Statutory Board or agency that has drawn a similar conclusion.\nMr Png Eng Huat\n:\nI have drawn examples from AGO's reports because I read them every year. It is not meant to be a comparison with AGO's report on AHPETC. I have mentioned in the final part – that it is not meant as a comparison, but it is meant to point out that such lapses do exist and I had mentioned that good corporate governance is a work-in-progress. We have accepted the AGO report. We have accepted it and Mr Low Thia Khiang has already stated at the beginning of his speech that we support the Motion.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMrs Josephine Teo.\nMrs Josephine Teo\n: Mdm Speaker, unless I am completely mistaken, sitting right opposite Mr Png when he was speaking, he said something to the effect that in any other report made by the AGO, it would not attract the same level of scrutiny. That is the effect of what he was saying.\nSo, I seek this very specific clarification. I think it is an important clarification because the audits that the AGO conducts of Ministries and Statutory Boards are something that is done every single year. The report is tabled to Parliament. And every Ministry or Statutory Board that has findings has to account for it.\nWhen, in the past, as a Member of the backbench, I had been seated in the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), I can share with Members very honestly and very certainly that Ministries and Statutory Boards, when they respond to queries, they take a very different\nPage: 37\nattitude and replies to the PAC take on a very different tone than the tone that is reflected in the AHPETC's comments to the AGO.\nSo, I wanted to seek this clarification because Mr Png, it seems to me, has suggested that Ministries and Statutory Boards have the same problems. But the conclusion drawn by the AGO is a very specific one. It says that unless the weaknesses are addressed, there can be no assurance that AHPETC's financial statements are accurate and reliable and that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed.\nSo, I would like to know whether Mr Png is aware of any other occasion that the AGO has drawn the same conclusion for a Government Ministry or Statutory Board. That is a very important point. Since the Member has raised this point, I hope you will clarify it.\nMr Png Eng Huat\n: The AGO report presented to Parliament does not have all those conclusions stated there. If we read the AGO report presented every year, it is all stated there. There is no conclusion for those cases that AGO cited. Some of them would say they would refer the cases to the Police for investigations and some of them would say they would take remedial action.\nSo, likewise, the WP has said we have taken measures. Yesterday, Ms Sylvia Lim had highlighted those measures and what we have done. So, the conclusion that AHPETC got from AGO is, it is unique, yes, we accepted it. But those examples that I cited are things that AGO picked up, too. Are those not real instances where lapses happened, too? I am not saying that because it is AHPETC which is tabled in Parliament, but I am just citing that AGO's work is thorough, fair and I respect it.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMr Pritam Singh.\n2.51 pm\nMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)\n: Mdm Speaker, in Minister Khaw Boon Wan's letter to the Minister of Finance dated 18 February 2014, the Minister highlighted four issues in particular that he felt were not addressed by AHPETC, hereafter referred to as the Town Council. This led to his request to the Minister for Finance to carry out an audit on the Town Council through the AGO. Ms Sylvia Lim has already spoken on the first two points covering related party transactions and the transfer of Sinking Funds.\nThe third issue, on the failure to make available accounts and records after the audit period FY2012/2013 available to the auditor, Foo Kon Tan, for subsequent event review, has been addressed by the AGO. The AGO found no significant matters in these documents that\nPage: 38\nwould materially affect the Town Council's FY2012/2013 financial statements. Be that as it may, the Town Council acknowledges the points made by the AGO on this note.\nI will speak largely on the fourth matter raised in the Minister's letter to the Finance Minister covering the unexplained differences in the figures under audit amounting to a total exceeding $20 million. This matter overlaps to some extent, with the observations made by the AGO, summarised as items 4 and 5 in its main report. This broadly covers the lapses in internal control, procurement and inadequacies in record management and accounting system.\nI will deal with these matters, focusing on the disclaimers and issues that have the highest financial signature, in the spirit of full transparency and accountability to the residents of AHPETC and to Singaporeans. I will also provide some context that the public should be made aware of, acknowledge shortcomings, identify ideas where systemic improvements will be or have already been made and where processes will continue to be enhanced.\nFirst, lift upgrading programme and lift expenses. Mdm Speaker, Foo Kon Tan's fifth disclaimer was on the HDB Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) and covered its inability to determine the accuracy of AHPETC's lift upgrading expenses of about $18.6 million.\nTo provide some context to this point, the FMSS staff who previously worked in the Hougang Town Council environment were not familiar with the nature of the billings to HDB for LUP works, as no lift upgrading was carried out in Hougang SMC in the past. Some LUP bills were passed on to FMSS from the previous Managing Agent under the PAP-run Aljunied Town Council. This matter was also brought up in Parliament in 2012 by Ms Sylvia Lim.\nIn particular, the Town Council was concerned about instances where it was billed one year in advance by HDB and certain bills were carried over from FY2011 to FY2012, amongst other matters. Accordingly, the Town Council did not recognise LUP expenses in earlier years amounting to $8.38 million as the Town Council disputed its share of LUP expenses with HDB. In view of the very large numbers, one can understand why the Town Council took a cautious approach. The AGO report has since confirmed that the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council has fully paid up the $18.61 million owed to HDB in May 2013 and that this matter has been fully resolved.\nAssociated with this point is Foo Kon Tan's fourth disclaimer which stated that lift repair expenses of about $1.6 million were expenses that related to the previous financial year and that the Town Council management did not ascertain the quantum of the prior year's\nPage: 39\nexpenses and that their expenditure had been over-stated.\nThe Town Council informed the AGO that some work orders were not raised before 31 March 2012 for works performed in FY2011/2012 due to a staff oversight, explaining the incorrect recording of those expenses. The AGO found out that the actual amount of expenses relating to FY2011/2012 included in the FY2012/2013 audit was actually $63,902 and that the impact of this error in the AGO's words, was, I quote, \"not significant.\"\nNonetheless, the AHPETC informed the AGO that with the implementation of the work orders system module on 1 April 2012 for non-routine works, and 1 October 2012 for routine works, lift repair expenses would be accounted for in a timely manner going forward.\nPoint two, receivables from various stakeholders. The second disclaimer from Foo Kon Tan covered receivables from the Citizens Consultative Committee (CCC), a carry-over largely of the CIPC funding process governed by MND to the previous PAP Aljunied Town Council. The other stakeholders in this disclaimer are the taxman and sundry debtors. The total amount in question under this heading is about $3.1 million.\nFirst, the CCC. The AGO's findings revealed that, in fact, about $614,237 was due from the CCC while the remaining $563,622 were receivables from other parties, such as tenants and lessees. Separately, even though HDB had banked in about $388,887 into the AHPETC's bank account in June and September 2012, the Town Council was unable to match the receipts to the corresponding receivables.\nThe Town Council would like to acknowledge the AGO's efforts in unravelling this disclaimer and following up with the Ang Mo Kio Town Council which, in the aftermath of the AGO's audit and intervention, established that the reimbursement it received from HDB should have originally been made to AHPETC instead, by virtue of boundary changes made on the occasion of the 2011 General Elections.\nI will deal with the point by the AGO that it was able to unravel the issue of the CCC receivables using documents given to it by AHPETC later in my speech, covering the handing over and taking over of records between the old Aljunied Town Council and AHPETC and the management of records in general.\nSecondly, on receivables from the taxman, IRAS. Foo Kon Tan noted in its FY2012/2013 audit report that it was not able to ascertain receivables amounting to $110,735. AHPETC acknowledges that these receivables were wrongly stated and that it has duly reversed out these incorrectly stated receivables in May 2014.\nPage: 40\nThirdly, on sundry debtors. Foo Kon Tan noted in its FY2012/2013 audit report that it was not able to ascertain about $1.8 million of receivables from sundry debtors. AGO found out that the Town Council had incorrectly over-stated about half these receivables and that the Town Council should have been more industrious in recovering payments on a timely basis.\nMdm Speaker, while the Town Council acknowledges this point, a bit of background will be helpful to contextualise this particular issue. When the Town Council upscaled the Hougang Town Council's computer system to replace the terminated system used by the former Aljunied Town Council, the Hougang system had a limited number of categories for Town Council operations. This system was set up for the operation of a single member ward of an Opposition Town Council. The accounting for Government programmes, such as the revitalisation of shops, neighbourhood renewal programme and schemes involving the Town Council's collaboration with NEA were new and, in some cases, unheard of to the management of AHPETC. Like lift upgrading, many of these were not extended to Hougang in the past.\nSeparately, some invoices were the subject of disagreements with HDB on co-payment for facade repair to HDB blocks and, hence, were subject to follow-up by the Town Council, resulting in them not being removed as receivables. The Town Council has since informed AGO that it has received payment from sundry debtors in the two financial years after the Foo Kon Tan audit of FY2012/2013, amounting to $508,730, of which, $483,134 was owed by HDB.\nSeparately, the AGO report noted that about $376,316 remained outstanding to AHPETC from HDB and NEA respectively, with some owed for more than two years. The AGO's findings also confirmed that NEA had overlooked eight invoices amounting to $11,673 owed to AHPETC. For two particular invoices not rejected by HDB and deemed to be in order, HDB informed AGO that it was still reviewing claims amounting to $175,067, which it received in May and September 2012, almost two and a half years after they were presented to HDB by AHPETC.\nMdm Speaker, notwithstanding, the Town Council has adopted a practice of management regularly churning out a list of debtors and appointing a finance staff to follow up with debtors by issuing reminders on the sums owed. This due diligence will have a positive knock-on effect in ensuring that receivables owed are captured in the accounts to accurately reflect the transactions and state of affairs in the Town Council.\nPoint three, creditors and accrued expenses. According to Foo Kon Tan's disclaimer, the total amount in question under this head comes to $647,094. The first issue on accrued liabilities covers a claim by Foo Kon Tan that the Town Council did not have an SOP covering\nPage: 41\nthe timely recording of liabilities. I will deal with this issue, first.\nThe AGO has taken a different position from Foo Kon Tan on this point, to correctly report that the Town Council, indeed, had an SOP, with the qualification that this SOP does not stipulate a timeline for verification works done by property officers after job sheets were received, to enable the timely issuance of work orders. I have since personally checked on the SOP with the Town Council's property manager and confirmed that, for the overwhelming number of accrued liabilities, the SOP now puts the timeframe from job completion to issuance of payments to take a maximum of three months.\nSecondly, on accruals without work orders. Foo Kon Tan reported that the Town Council was unable to provide details covering some $338,379 in accrued expenses from the previous Aljunied Town Council. The Town Council explained that it was not able to provide the details required as it did not have supporting documents. The AGO was able to find out that some of these items were over-statements, as the Town Council did not reverse out the accrued expenses from its accounts.\nAs explained earlier, the Town Council was hampered operating a GRC with a manual works order system. With the rollout of a new works order system in 2012, the Town Council is enhancing its SOPs to ensure that, moving forward, an accurate reflection of the amounts due to external parties is established.\nThirdly, on other payables. The AGO found poor monitoring and lack of due diligence by the Town Council in following up on items in a temporary clearing account which Foo Kon Tan noted came up to $308,715. The Town Council has since cleared up many of the receipts and we will put in resources to clear up the remaining amount.\nMdm Speaker, the Town Council accepts that proper management involving the handover of records from the previous management was something that, in hindsight, should have been better addressed. The reality at that time was that many staff who signed for finance-related files from the previous Managing Agent after GE 2011, resigned in 2011 and 2012. With this, came the loss of the institutional knowledge specific to documents pertaining to the handover period.\nGoing forward, and in the interest of better corporate governance, the Town Council will monitor the management and handover of records more systematically. To that end, proper handover procedures for resigning staff prior to the issuance of their final pay cheque have already been implemented.\nPage: 42\nBefore concluding, Mdm Speaker, I wish to say a few words about tenders and contracts as I have been the Chairman of the Tenders and Contracts Committee since 2012. In that context, it would also be appropriate for me to make some comments about the Managing Agent's role in the decision-making process involving the calling of tenders and award of contracts in view of some media reports insinuating personal benefit for FMSS by virtue of being the Managing Agent of AHPETC.\nFirstly, in a situation where FMSS is a tenderer in a tender called by the Town Council, as was the case in 2011 for the Managing Agent contract, FMSS is kept at an arm's length and a China wall is built between FMSS and the Town Council. What happens in such a case? The evaluation of such a tender is done solely by the elected and appointed members of the Town Council, all of whom have no interest, pecuniary or otherwise, in FMSS. The decision-making to award the tender in such a case will be the sole remit of the Tenders and Contracts Committee. No staff member of the Managing Agent is privy to the evaluation or decision-making process in this case. The Secretary of the Town Council Mr Danny Loh and its General Manager Ms How Weng Fan are not involved in this process at all.\nIn 2011, in view of operational exigencies, a decision was made, with the concurrence of Town Councillors, and, as detailed earlier, FMSS did not participate in the evaluation or recommendation, in strict adherence with the Town Council's financial rules.\nThis was the same scenario that played itself out late last year and early this year, when Town Councillors met to evaluate the specifications of the Managing Agent tender for FY2015 and beyond.\nIn a second scenario where FMSS does not participate in the tenders called by the Town Council pertaining to, for example, conservancy lift maintenance and horticultural contracts, FMSS' role is purely administrative. FMSS is expected to thoroughly evaluate and assess the tenderers and recommend which tenderers meet the minimum requirements of the Town Council. At no point does FMSS make a decision on whom to award the tender to.\nFMSS' administrative role is purely to advise the Tenders and Contracts Committee on the tenderers and their submissions. It is for the Committee to deliberate and determine, in the interests of the residents of the Town Council, which tenderer the contract ought to be awarded to, after considering all the relevant facts. Once again, no personal benefit is accrued to FMSS by virtue of these processes.\nMdm Speaker, I have not covered all the points made by both AGO and PwC in their reports. But I have focused on the big sum items. This, in no way, minifies or downplays the weight the Town Council places on arrears where there are amounts owing or owed, and for\nPage: 43\nreconciliation or follow-up, are lower or less significant.\nThe Town Council will strengthen its processes and we will do it with the same vigour that we sought to ensure that residents' lives would not be affected during the course of the post-GE2011 handover. I would like to thank all the staff of the Town Council, past and present, for their efforts and service to the Town Council. I note that AGO, with a full-time team working for almost a year, with up to 16 personnel, including those from PwC, did not flag out any potential criminal wrong-doing on the part of any staff member of the Town Council.\nWe will make full use of the AGO's findings to boost our financial systems and processes.\n3.08 pm\nMr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)\n: Mdm Speaker, in my 24 years as a lawyer, I have investigated the affairs of a number of companies, including listed companies, and have authored a few audit or investigation reports myself. It has been my experience that lapses are invariably caused by human failings. You may have good systems in place but, ultimately, your systems are only as good as the people who run them.\nThere will always be individuals who will ignore or try to get around the rules – sometimes because they are lazy or complacent, sometimes because they are incompetent and sometimes, unfortunately, because they are dishonest. Almost always, they are not questioned or challenged because of the positions they occupy. In every case I have been in, losses were suffered.\nAnd so, the findings in the AGO report are depressingly familiar to me. I have read a number of media and online reports which have portrayed the report's findings as \"lapses in control\", \"inadequate oversight\" or \"poor management of records\". Indeed, there are many such findings in that report. But these understate the gravity of the findings.\nSo, I had planned to come to this House to make the point that these are serious matters. But then I encountered something quite bizarre. The people I discussed the matter with kept telling me – do not attack the WP; they will only get more sympathy; find a way to move on; you have to keep in mind the politics.\nI could not get my head around that. Has it really come to this? This is a matter involving public funds. How could anyone, in good conscience, ignore or downplay what the AGO and PwC have found? These are not partisan bodies. And Mr Png accepts that. Indeed, AGO routinely audits Government agencies and does not shirk from highlighting lapses, and\nPage: 44\nMembers of all parties in this House have rightly criticised those lapses and held the Government to account. So, why should WP be let off easy just because they are the Opposition? And why should their residents be forced to accept anything less than full accountability? This cannot be the right way forward.\nAnd sure enough, when Mr Low and Ms Lim spoke yesterday, they tried to downplay the breaches and make excuses for themselves – we are small; we are learning; the system is against us; these are only procedural lapses. That is playing politics. And these excuses are flimsy.\nMr Low says that, unlike the PAP Town Councils, it is very difficult for WP to find a Managing Agent. But the Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council does not have a Managing Agent. For the last 19 years, we have been managing the Town Council ourselves. We employ our own staff and ensure that they are trained and have the proper skills to do their job. We are not perfect, but we consistently score an all-green rating in our TCMRs; our accounts are submitted on time and, all the time, are unqualified.\nMr Low also had no Managing Agent when he ran Hougang Town Council. So, this issue of a Managing Agent is a complete red herring. Mr Chen Show Mao, a very experienced corporate lawyer, then suggests the rules on disclosing conflicts are unclear and difficult to apply. But that is not correct. The rules are simple; he must know that. Besides, they have professionals they can turn to for advice. And if the rules are so unclear, why is AHPETC the only Town Council with difficulty following them?\nSo, Mdm Speaker, to me, all these are deflections and distractions. What is more important is what the AGO report actually says. And these findings cannot be brushed off as down to inexperience or a lack of resources. This entire episode raises questions about the competence, accountability and integrity of those who run AHPETC. Minister Shanmugam gave examples yesterday and some are worth restating.\nFirst, the appointment of FMSS and FMSI and their ownership by the Secretary of AHPETC and his wife, who is also the General Manager of FMSS – both hardcore WP members. By any standard of corporate governance, the engagement of FMSS and FMSI involves a conflict of interest. Ms Lim suggests that FMSS was appointed because CPG did not want to continue as Managing Agent. But there is still no explanation as to why FMSS was formed seven days after the election results, and before CPG discontinued its services.\nBut that is not all. There is nothing wrong per se with an engagement which involves a conflict of interest, provided – and this is critical – it is in the best interests of the organisation, the conflict is fully and properly declared and disclosed, and the risks are managed. The AGO\nPage: 45\nreport makes it clear that all this was not done. The AGO report notes that PwC Consulting did not see any documentary evidence that the AHPETC Town Councillors had considered the full extent of the conflicts of interests involved and the safeguards needed. We are still waiting for an explanation why the minutes do not reflect that Mr Loh and his wife's ownership of FMSS was not declared. Still waiting for that.\nBut that is still not all. We heard the examples yesterday of how the Secretary, General Manager and Deputy General Manager routinely issued works orders and approved payments, effectively, to themselves. Mr Png says there are oversight committees, but PwC was unable to determine if the Chairman and Vice Chairman of AHPETC adequately verified payments to related parties before they sign the cheques.\nMr Png repeats what Ms Lim says, and says that these are over recurring payments and that if you do not pay them, the rubbish will pile up high. But again, that is not the point. They keep missing the point. Just because there is a contract does not mean you pay blindly. Where is the oversight? In other words, what is the assurance that the very people who are in a conflict did not take advantage of their position? The report makes it quite clear that there was no such assurance. There was no assurance that the services they were being paid for were performed or performed adequately.\nIn other words, these people were patting themselves on the back while lining their own pockets. And, now, they have all ended up in knots. So, these are egregious breaches that demand a proper explanation, not excuses. And it cannot be a question of inexperience.\nSecond, was the appointment of FMSS, the party in conflict, in the best interests of the Town Council? The report says that there was no open competition in FMSS' appointment and, therefore, no assurance that AHPETC obtained competitive prices for their services. The report then gives an extraordinary account of how FMSS' fees came to be approved. It states that the AHPETC Town Councillors were assured that FMSS would charge about the same amount as the previous contractors. But this was false. The report notes that the combined fee of the previous contractors was only about $49,000 a month. As it turns out, the fees billed by FMSS for the period from October 2011 to June 2012 averaged $67,000 a month, more than 35% higher.\nIn short, their own Town Councillors were misled. Ms Lim now says all these were errors, rounding-up errors, and so on. But such an error is so flagrant that it certainly raises suspicions and warrants a more thorough investigation.\nWhat is important to appreciate is that it is not the AGO's remit to determine whether dishonesty was involved. And even if we accept that a mistake had been made at the outset,\nPage: 46\nit is hard to believe that the nine months of over-payment was not discovered.\nBut the worst thing for me in this entire debate – really, the worst thing for me – was that Ms Lim and her team said in response to the AGO report that it confirms that no monies are missing nor has criminal or dishonest activity been uncovered. Mr Low repeated that argument yesterday and I think it is being said ad nauseam\nin this House. This is a consistent line they are giving to this House and, no doubt, to their residents as well.\nBut this is blatantly misleading on two counts. First, the report says no such thing. In fact, after that statement came out, AGO responded that Ms Lim's, and I quote, \"broad conclusion cannot be derived from AGO's audit\".\nWhat does the report, in fact, say? An important element of the cases I mentioned involves piecing together what went wrong and tracing or figuring out where monies have gone to. By and large, this can be done because almost all transactions leave paper trails and forensic accountants use documents to analyse, reconstruct and draw a picture of what had happened. But what does the AGO report say about the state of the AHPETC documents? I will quote some portions.\nAt paragraph 5.13, \"PwC was not provided with sufficient documentary evidence for it to independently ascertain the manner and extent of verification of the payments at the cheque-signing stage by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\"\nAt paragraph 5.28, \"AHPETC did not have a proper system to ensure that documents were properly accounted for and safeguarded. AHPETC was unable to provide supporting documents for the period April to July 2011 to its auditor.\"\nAt paragraph 5.31, \"AHPETC also could not provide some documents required during the current audit that concerned transactions taking place after AHPETC had taken over from the previous Town Council.\" So, it has nothing to do with the previous Town Council. \"In response to reminders, AHPETC indicated that it could not locate some of the documents and was still looking for others, three months after the request for the documents.\"\nAnd then the report concludes at paragraph 4.1, I quote, \"until the weaknesses are addressed, there can be no assurance that AHPETC's accounts are accurate and reliable, or that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed.\"\nIn short, AGO cannot say if public monies have all been accounted for because documents which AHPETC were obliged to keep are missing. So, contrary to what Ms Lim and her colleagues want the public to believe, the AGO report does not, by any stretch,\nPage: 47\nconfirm that no monies are missing, or that there is no criminal or dishonest activity. Rather, it says that it does not know because of the way the Town Council has mismanaged its operations. If AHPETC considers this an endorsement, then it speaks volumes about its attitude towards managing public funds.\nMy second problem with that statement, because as Mr Shanmugam explained and as any person with any common sense knows, loss does not only occur when money is stolen. There are numerous instances in the report of possible breaches of fiduciary duties by AHPETC officers. We now also know that FMSS was paid far more than other Managing Agents. We now know that there were substantial over-payments to FMSS, which would not have been discovered but for the audit. And we also know that an operating surplus of over $3.2 million has become a deficit of over $700,000. That money is not going to come back. This is something we still have not heard an explanation for. Could there be more examples? We do not know because the accounts for FY2013 have not yet been submitted.\nWhile lapses can occur in all organisations – and I accept that – my experience has also shown me what distinguishes a good organisation is its response to discovering those lapses: failings are acknowledged, systems tightened, losses made good and those responsible dealt with.\nSo, what was AHPETC's response? First, to brush off the many lapses as, I quote, \"mistakes and omissions due to inadvertence, human error, IT system constraints and a lack of experience dealing with certain scenarios.\" And then, second, to misleadingly spin the report as an endorsement that there was no wrongdoing.\nIt was a blasé response from people charged with handling millions in public funds. They did initially come to this House with a different, more contrite tone – I thought I heard that – and I acknowledge their saying that they will support the Motion. But that facade completely fell away when Mr Pritam Singh said that he will answer to residents who ask him questions during his house visits and he will not answer the questions posed in this House.\nLet me ask Mr Singh this: does this mean that you will keep silent if no one asks you? How many residents does he think would have read the report and fully digested its contents? How many will have the accounting or legal training to know the full implications of the report and know the right questions to ask? And is your answer going to be, to every question asked, \"Do not worry, AGO said no wrongdoing\"?\nThe real question is how is the WP team going to account to their residents? In fact, not just their residents, it should be all Singaporeans, because half of their revenue comes from\nPage: 48\nGovernment grants which we all contribute to. Make no mistake, if this had been any other company, the directors would have been immediately removed and a Receiver appointed to protect its assets. No doubt about it. This happens many times in the private sector, and I do not think anyone will dispute that.\nAGO has explained why it does not know certain things because it has not been shown the documents. Ms Lim and her colleagues attempt to play down and rewrite the findings in the AGO report. Their attempts, really, do not change the findings themselves and certainly does not make things right.\nIf Ms Lim and her team are truly for transparency and accountability, which they say they are, they should help all of us understand what really happened, not obfuscate, deflect and distract. We should not forget that we are dealing with hard-earned public funds and, ultimately, the interests and welfare of Singaporeans living in Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East. They did no wrong and they deserve better. The answer cannot be same-old business as usual or \"I will improve going forward\". That cannot be the answer or, at least, the complete answer.\nMost of all, Ms Lim, Mr Singh and the entire team, they need to assure this House that no public funds under their care have been lost, misappropriated or are unaccounted for, and that AHPETC has not suffered loss in the real sense and not the narrow sense they want to use.\nThey have said much in this House – many speakers, all of them have had their say – but they have carefully avoided saying that there has been no loss. And if they can give that assurance – that there has been no loss – then they must tell us how they know. How are they able to give that assurance, given the findings in the AGO report, the missing documents, their own auditors' refusal to sign off on the audit and their own inability to say when the accounts for FY2013 will be ready?\nDespite all their claims that everything is hunky-dory, it will be done, they still cannot give a commitment as to when those accounts will be ready. And if they cannot give a complete and satisfactory answer to the highly relevant questions Mr Shanmugam posed, then something must be done. It is now close to four years since they took over. I do not know if there is a statute of limitations for excuses, but they must have long exceeded it.\nWhat is the right and only thing to do? Do what any responsible company and board of directors in such a situation would do – for AHPETC to commission a complete forensic investigation and, thereafter, undertake legal proceedings to recover all losses and damages\nPage: 49\nsuffered by it, regardless of who the potential or prospective defendant may be.\nThe WP team should also procure an undertaking from FMSS and FMIS that they will make all their papers and their staff available for that investigation. That is the only way to put this matter to rest. I really hope, for the sake of the residents, that the result will be that AHPETC has suffered no loss or will be able to recover their losses – that is good for the residents. But we need to do that investigation and find out. But if WP is not willing to do this, then that says everything.\nMdm Speaker, last year, we debated in this House what constructive politics means and how we would like to see our political landscape evolve. The Motion reflects an intention and desire to do what is necessary for the good of Singapore and Singaporeans. But it is not enough for the WP to simply say they support the Motion. If they mean what they say, they must follow through by doing everything they can to ensure that all the legitimate questions posed have been answered and this entire mess is cleaned up once and for all.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMs Lee Li Lian. Mr Pritam Singh, you have a clarification?\n3.26 pm\nMr Pritam Singh\n: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Mdm Speaker, with regard to the point made by the hon Member, the WP MPs have come to Parliament and we are taking collective responsibility for all the issues that affect our Town Council. We are not here to make excuses and I have said we will work towards cleaning up the accounts in my speech. We acknowledge the lapses and we will put things right. That is the message that I want to give to the Member.\nThe second issue was a point made about this figure of $733,000 from the old Aljunied 2010 accounts and the deficit of $3.3 million in the 2012 accounts of the Aljunied-Punggol East Town Council. Can I just confirm which document the Member was reading these figures from before I give the Member a reply, please?\nMr Hri Kumar Nair\n: Mdm Speaker, I acknowledge what the hon Member has said. They have come to this House to answer the questions they can answer or are willing to answer. They have not answered all the questions that we have posed to them and they are certainly not answering the questions that they do not want to answer. And all I need to ask them to do is to pick up the Hansard\nof Mr Shanmugam's speech where he has posed a number of very highly relevant, very legitimate questions and just answer those. That is a good start, and I invite him to do that today and, if not today, then in the near future, and not six or 12\nPage: 50\nmonths down the road.\nOn the second point, I was restating the figures given by Mr Khaw in his speech where he made it clear that the Aljunied Town Council had an operating surplus of over $3.2 million, and it has now become an operating deficit of over $700,000 after the WP took over.\nMr Pritam Singh\n:\nThank you very much for that. Can I then put the question, Sir, to Minister Khaw, which document he was referring to, just for us to be clear on this before I reply to this point?\nThe Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)\n:\nThank you. May I refer you to the AGO report, main report, page 3?\nMr Pritam Singh\n: Thank you, Minister. Minister, those figures originated from the income and expenditure statements for Financial Year 31 March 2012, Financial Year 31 March 2013. If we look into those figures, that is correct for 2010 under the previous Aljunied Town Council. If we look at the operating expenditure, there are five heads. Cleaning Works under the previous Aljunied Town Council was $5.1 million; under the AHPETC in 2012 was $6.7 million. For Lift Maintenance, it was $1.8 million in 2010 and $4 million in 2012. That is a rise of about $2.1 million to $2.2 million. Water and Electricity was $8.9 million in 2010 and it was $10.1 million in 2012. It was a larger town by 2012, so that explains that. There are two other heads, but let me deal with the one which has the largest cost increase, which is lift maintenance.\nI remember sometime in 2012, there was an episode where a lift did not home to the correct floor. There was a resident in the lift. This was in Paya Lebar, if my memory serves me right. In 2011, I beg your pardon. And the resident, of course, had a very jarring experience. At that point, the Members of Parliament got to know about it and we were quite concerned about safety issues involving lifts and lift maintenance. So, the Town Council commissioned the consultant to try and understand our lift maintenance contracts, lift maintenance procedures, whether there was any problem with them and what we could do to improve the situation.\nAnd at that point, it was determined that for the novated contract from the Aljunied Town Council, it had third party who was looking after all the lifts in the town and we had a lot of different types of lifts, as I am sure the other Town Councils do – 9G lifts, Mitsubishi lifts, Sigma lifts, EM Services, Otis, Fujitec – and it goes on and on, of course. So, the recommendation that was made to the Town Council was to try as far as possible to ensure that, for lift maintenance, get the original equipment manufacturer to be maintaining those lifts. And this was quite an important consideration for us because we were noticing that the\nPage: 51\nlift downtimes for lifts which were maintained by this third-party contractor were rather long.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMr Singh, you have to keep your clarification short and not make a speech.\nMr Pritam Singh\n:\nYes. I will finish up very shortly. Because of those downtimes, we decided, \"Look, we have to probably invest a bit more money and try and make sure that our lift maintenance procedures and contracts are up to the mark or up to the satisfaction of the Members of Parliament. And that really explains the large jump of about $2.2 million. It is the largest jump in the operating expenditure. And that explains that figure.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMr Hri Kumar.\nMr Hri Kumar Nair\n:\nMdm Speaker, can I get a clarification of Mr Singh's clarification? He has asked me a question, I have answered him. I have asked him whether he is going to answer the questions which Mr Shanmugam posed and when is he going to answer those questions.\nMr Pritam Singh\n:\nMdm Speaker, I have made it clear that we all\n—\n[(proc text) Hon Member\tMr Low Thia Khiang rose. (proc text)]\nMr Pritam Singh\n:\nMr Low, do you want to take the floor?\nMr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)\n:\nMdm Speaker, as Mr Pritam Singh said, we will take collective responsibility as a team. I do not see any Member of Parliament should need to answer any individual questions.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMs Lee Li Lian.\n3.33 pm\nMs Lee Li Lian (Punggol East)\n: Thank you, Madam. Finally, I get to speak. I reiterate what my fellow party colleagues had all said before me, that is, the Town Council acknowledges that there are areas for improvements which were highlighted by the audit. Going forward, we are committed to improving the processes and have, indeed, taken on some measures already.\nPage: 52\nThere are two parts to my speech. Part one, is to address some of the disclaimers pointed out by AGO and what the Town Council has since done to improve the system and work processes. Next, I will also be touching on my experience with unforeseen challenges faced by Opposition Town Councils.\nNumber one: disclaimers flagged out by AGO. I refer to Appendix A of the AGO's report, disclaimers 8, 9 and 10 and what the Town Council has since done to improve our systems and work processes. These are information already publicly available.\nDisclaimer 8: income taxes. The Town Council had since engaged a tax agent to prepare the income tax computations for FY2012/2013 as well as FY 2013/2014.\nDisclaimer 9: goods and services taxes. Some of these problems arose because the former Finance Manager, who was familiar with the GST submissions had, unfortunately, resigned. Going forward, the Town Council will have to work with our IT vendor to split the GST for routine and Sinking Fund income or expenses in the system. Several of our Town Council Finance team are also now familiar with the apportionment formula required by IRAS. Systems and processes for out-going staff have been put in place, as mentioned earlier by my fellow colleague Mr Pritam Singh.\nDisclaimer 10: cash and bank balances. AHPETC recognised that it is good control practice for bank reconciliation to be independently reviewed and for the reviewer to sign off and date on the bank reconciliation statement as evidence of review. When Aljunied-Hougang Town Council was formed in 2011, the merger resulted in the Town Council inheriting several bank accounts from the former management, in addition to those from Hougang Town Council. These accounts were mainly used for receipts and payments.\nTo streamline the accounts, the Town Council decided to close unnecessary accounts, leaving only four accounts, that is, one operating fund and one Sinking Fund account each with two banks. Since mid-2013, the Town Council has been doing monthly bank reconciliation at the account level for each of these four accounts.\nI move on to Appendix B of the AGO report on Internal Controls, points 5, 6 and 7.\nPoint 5: weak controls over cheques received. The Town Council noted AGO's observations and had improved upon its safeguarding of cheques received by mail. Cheques not banked in by the end of the day are now placed in the safe. As an additional control, all cheques received are scanned by Finance staff into a central server. Currently, the reception area is already monitored by CCTV, which would be able to detect unauthorised personnel\nPage: 53\naccessing mails received.\nPoint 6: surprise examinations not carried out in accordance with Town Councils Financial Rules. The Town Council has noted this observation and will implement surprise checks by the Town Council Secretary or his representative at every branch office at least once a financial year. A senior Finance staff had gone to each branch office in FY2013 and FY2014 to conduct a surprise check on cash collections and balances.\nPoint 7: weak controls over access to strong room and safe. There were already written authorisations by the Secretary to various officers to hold the keys to the strong room in the Town Council HQ and Finance rooms and safes at Town Council HQ as well as the branches. The Town Council has since enhanced its controls and obtained the Chairman and Secretary's authorisations for access to the strong rooms and safes.\nNext, Madam, I move on to unforeseen challenges. I had my first \"surprise\" shortly after the Punggol East by-election in January 2013. I was on the ground shortly after to meet representatives from the then conservancy contractor for both SK 1 and SK 2. SK 1 refers to blocks 101 to 141 and SK 2 refers to blocks 142 to 197.\nWe were informed by the contractor from SK 1 that because of issues they were having with the Ministry of Manpower, they were not able to continue their contract with us.\nAs AHPETC was going to take over only from May 2013, the Town Council requested the handing over Town Council, that is, Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council, to call for a tender for SK 1 in March. Subsequently, two established cleaning companies tendered for the contract.\nThe tenderers were invited to attend the tender meeting in late April 2013, just before the handover in May. Unfortunately, representatives were sent from both companies to inform that they were no longer able to participate in the tender and would like to withdraw from the tender process. It was also followed up by written notices to the Town Council Chairman on their decision to withdraw without any valid reasons.\nAHPETC had no choice but to respect the companies' decision to withdraw. As the incumbent conservancy contractor had to cease their services by end June 2013, the Town Council then needed to quickly make a decision to invite companies to tender; otherwise no one will be clearing rubbish and cleaning lifts! This is just one of the many challenges an Opposition Town Council faces.\nOn the other hand, I am pleased to note that EMSU services provided by the previous contractor continued their services in Punggol East. Regardless of political affiliations,\nPage: 54\nresidents' interests should always be the priority and there should not be elements of political preference or fear. It will be sad if there are elements of fear when bidding for a project in Opposition Town Councils.\nIn conclusion, Madam, we respect the findings made by AGO. In response, I want to emphasise that the Town Council has already made changes to work processes, systems and procedures to address specific lapses. With that, I would like to end off my speech by thanking all the staff who were involved in this rigorous audit process.\nMdm Speaker\n: Order. I propose to take the break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 4.00 pm.\nSitting accordingly suspended\nat 3.40 pm until 4.00 pm.\nSitting resumed at 4.00 pm.\n[Mdm Speaker in the Chair]\nPage: 55",

    "subTitle": null,
    "sectionType": "OS",
    "content": "[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]\n4.01 pm\nThe Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat)\n: Mdm Speaker, I rise to speak because I am concerned about the well-being and interests of the residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East. I am concerned about their lives and their homes. They have been short-changed by their Members of Parliament and they have been kept in the dark. I am concerned about the well-being and interests of all Singaporeans. Elected Members of Parliament are expected to be clean and honest and to act with integrity.\nThis Motion boils down to one word – trust. The people trust that the Members of Parliament will keep their promises with integrity. The people trust that we will take seriously our full responsibility to serve our people and to serve their best interests. So, I am sad to observe that elected Town Councillors of AHPETC have betrayed the people's trust.\nThey betrayed the people's trust in three ways. One, they betrayed the people's trust by failing to act in the best interests of the residents. Two, they betrayed the people's trust with a consistent pattern of evasive behaviour. Third, they betrayed the people's trust by promising one thing and doing another.\nFirst, the WP has betrayed the trust of the residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East. The residents cannot trust the WP on several counts. For a start, residents cannot trust the WP to get them a good deal. In fact, the WP has gotten them a raw deal. Their Managing Agents, FMSS and FMSI, charged the highest rate in Singapore for their services. Compared to the Managing Agent's fees paid by other Town Councils, residents paid more than $2 more a unit – one year, $1.6 million – and this went on for four years. Till now, after all the debate in the House, the public does not know, none of us knows, the reasons why FMSS and FMSI's rates are higher than everywhere else.\nResidents cannot trust elected Town Councillors not to sacrifice their long-term interests. In fact, these long-term interests are being sacrificed: $12 million went missing from their Sinking Fund – $12 million; missing. It was only after the AGO pointed this out that this was put back. And even so, one year after the financial year had ended, they still owed a substantial sum to the Sinking Fund.\nPage: 57\nIf not for the Auditor-General, the Town Councillors – the elected Town Councillors – would have kept the residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East in the dark. Nothing is transparent.\nThis is a very serious matter. It is wrong for the Town Councillors to argue that as long as money was put back, nothing was wrong in the first instance. The fact is that they put the money back only because they were caught. Why did this happen? Either the Managing Agent is totally incompetent or they deliberately decided not to fill the Sinking Fund to show a better financial picture and have a large operating account to pay for expenses, the largest item being the Managing Agent's fees. This happened because the Town Council was running into cash flow problems from their profligate management and they put off paying into the Sinking Fund, so that they may have money to pay. Now, really, that is compromising the long-term interests of residents to enrich their friends.\nThey did not forget to pay the Managing Agent's fees every month. They did not forget to collect S&CC from the honest, hardworking residents every month. But they forgot to pay large sums that were supposed to go into the Sinking Fund, and repeatedly. Was it because the Finance and Investment Committee chaired by Mr Chen Show Mao was not doing its work? Or was it another lapse by the Chairman? No explanation has been forthcoming.\nNow, this is serious. Sinking Funds are for long-term cyclical maintenance. We need to replace lifts for residents' safety, do major repairs like re-wiring and reroofing, repaint blocks. The safety and well-being of residents and their homes are at stake.\nDown the line, residents may find their Sinking Fund is all depleted, with nothing left to maintain the town safety and their well-being. When this happens, who suffers? Not the Town Council, not the Managing Agent. Who suffers are the residents. Worse of all, they would not know where the money has all gone.\nThis is a serious matter. In fact, the Town Council Act lists only three offences, and the use of Sinking Funds for operating expenses is one of them. It is precisely to guard against Managing Agents and Town Councils acting to meet short-term interests. Sadly, this is precisely what we are seeing – short-term, opportunistic behaviour.\nResidents cannot trust the elected Town Councillors to account honestly for where their money is. The Town Council cannot even keep basic accounts properly. You saw in the AGO report – inaccurate arrears, lapses in internal controls, poor records, late accounts, missing documents. These are not technical issues. These raise fundamental questions about whether the accounts can be trusted. All of this money comes from the people in one way or another – whether it is the S&CC that residents pay or the Sinking Fund that was built up\nPage: 58\nover the years from money paid by residents or the Government grants that MND provides out of taxpayers' money.\nWe cannot even trust the books. We are in the dark on the true state of affairs. If we are not vigilant, can we be sure that, down the road, somebody may not be cooking the books? Why did a surplus of $3.3 million in the operations become a deficit of $730,000 in just two years? Mr Pritam Singh attributed everything to lift upgrading. We must naturally ask, \"Where did the money go?\" We have asked, but we have not had a good answer. Though it may not be obvious on the surface, beneath the surface, the Town Council is rotting. And the rot is serious.\nI am also very concerned about the second way the WP has betrayed the people's trust. The pattern of behaviour; the consistent pattern of denial, deflection and protection of the Managing Agent which suggests a serious rot is happening. Clearly, the Managing Agent FMSS has failed. The elected Members of the Town Council should be held responsible. They appointed the Managing Agent. They are responsible for supervising the Managing Agent, for setting up a proper structure. You can outsource work; you cannot outsource responsibility. The responsibility lies squarely with the Members of Parliament on the Town Council.\nWhy did the elected Town Councillors allow such a deeply flawed structure to be set up in the very first place? We have not heard any good answer. Yesterday, Ms Lim said the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) record of FMSS was tabled. Was it discussed at any Town Council meeting? Was it debated? I think she has not given us the full truth.\nThe elected Town Councillors, instead of disciplining their Managing Agent and taking corrective action, defended them strongly. In 2013, they said, in Parliament, and I quote, \"FMSS was engaged based on its directors' experience in property management, professional skills and track record in running Hougang Town Council.\"\nWhat we have heard in this House so far is that they are inexperienced and these mistakes happened because people resigned. But Ms Sylvia Lim assured us in this House that they are professional and experienced. So, who is telling us the accurate version? And you are talking about experience. How much experience do you need to know that you cannot be handing money to your supporters, at the expense of over-charging your residents? How much experience do you need to truthfully disclose information to your auditors, including your own auditors? In fact, the AGO audit would not have been necessary if you had been honest and forthright in disclosing information to your own auditors. Where is the\nPage: 59\ntransparency that Mr Pritam Singh has been advocating so strongly?\nElected Town Councillors have acted in the best interests of their friends, the well-paid Managing Agent. They have neglected the interests of the residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East. Can residents trust that you are acting in their interests? Why are you so protective? Why are they so protective of their expensive Managing Agent that messed up the Town Council's work? Because they are their party supporters and friends?\nYesterday, in this House, Ms Sylvia Lim rejected the suggestion that the arrangement with FMSS was to benefit their friends. So, may I ask: are they your friends, or, at least, were they? Yes? Did they benefit? Yes, richly so. The structure that the WP set up allowed this to happen. You awarded contracts at these exorbitant rates and allowed them to get away with it. What other conclusions can be drawn?\nOn the other side, we know that AHPETC's financial position, even based on your own figures, which may not be the most reliable, has deteriorated sharply. The finances are now in the red. From a surplus of $3.3 million in the operations, it has now become a deficit of $730,000 in just two years. It is astounding. Two short years.\nThe WP asserted that no money was lost. What is astounding is how they even twisted the comments of AGO to justify their case. Mr Hri Kumar has dealt with this earlier on, but Mr Pritam Singh continued to repeat this. I urge you to read the auditor's report carefully.\nAt the very least, you would agree with me that it is not honest to twist the AGO's comments deliberately in this self-serving way.\nAll the WP MPs have said that they would take collective responsibility. They have said that they would support this Motion. I hope the support is in substance, not just form. If they support the Motion in substance, one would have expected that they will conduct a forensic audit, that they will take legal action against the Managing Agent FMSS; that they will file accounts immediately, on time, as required by the law and any administrative action; that they will put in place checks and balances where there is a severe conflict of interest. And their residents deserve to know what had happened. Are you prepared to come clean and explain and answer all the questions which have been raised in this House? How exactly will you safeguard the interest of residents?\nThe third way that the WP has betrayed the trust of our people is that they promise one thing and do another, quite the opposite. They say something in one forum, then, in another forum, they say something else.\nPage: 60\nThe WP's platform in the last General Election was First World Parliament where the Opposition will, I quote, \"function as a robust check and balance against the Government\". Over the last two days, we have seen so clearly how they have created a system where there is no check, no balance. You cannot even check yourself, or are you not willing to check yourself? They have been entrusted with running a Town Council. Where is the First World Town Council that they should be delivering? Instead, we have a Town Council who cannot account for where the resources go to.\nAnd, in fact, the real check in this instance came from the Government, the AGO. You have a pattern of behaviour where you did not answer to your own auditors, as a result of which the Auditor-General had gone in. If not for the AGO, Singaporeans would not have discovered this mess that the elected Town Councillors have created.\nThe WP also spoke vigorously about accountability, but surely, you will agree that the most basic aspect of accountability is the ability to keep proper accounts of the money that have been entrusted to you. I can understand if you are keeping accounts for the first time, but you are not – you have told residents of your experience in running Hougang Town Council. So, till today, we do not know the true state of accounts of AHPETC.\nThe WP said one thing and did another. Are they consistent with their statements? Mr Low started the debate yesterday by saying that he will be accountable. And then, immediately, Ms Sylvia Lim tried to explain away all their failings. Mr Low said that he will account in Parliament and, indeed, Ms Lim told the press earlier that the WP will explain in Parliament. But Mr Singh said in Chamber yesterday that he would only answer to his residents door-to-door. In fact, Mr Pritam Singh spoke about transparency, that the WP will press the Government for as much information as possible. But they do not even provide information to their own auditors.\nWhat the House witnessed yesterday is unbelievable. Mr Pritam Singh had said this, and I quote, \"We will constantly press the Government for more information, especially since it is so selective with the information it releases.\" When asked pertinent questions on transparency and accountability by Mr Shanmugam, Mr Pritam Singh said that he would not give a reply in Parliament – the First World Parliament which he claims he wants to build and which Mr Low Thia Khiang said he would account to. He refuses to answer to Parliament. So, why is Mr Singh so selective about where he answers his questions?\nOne of my colleagues bumped into Mr Yee Jenn Jong a month ago. When he asked him about the Town Council, he evaded the question and gave him a non-answer, \"Answer will be given at the right time and at the right place.\" And when pressed that he was a WP Central Executive Committee member and should have asked the Party Chairman to know what is\nPage: 61\ngoing on, he said this, and I quote, \"It is a matter for the elected Members.\"\nJust last evening, Mr Yee Jenn Jong and a group of his WP supporters, dressed in blue, were asked by a resident about what was going on in AHPETC. But he did not answer and walked away quickly. So, is this the answer Mr Singh promised to residents? A WP Central Executive Committee (CEC) member and his activists met residents and they evaded the question. So, would not answer auditors. Would not answer Parliament. Would not answer residents. Who is left in Singapore that the WP thinks is worthy of an answer?\nSadly, we saw in this House yesterday this pattern of behaviour of saying whatever suits them for the moment, among the WP MPs.\nMr Low Thia Khiang claimed that it is difficult for the Opposition to run Town Councils, or get qualified people to run Town Councils, that they have to start from scratch. But the PAP Town Councils also started from scratch when they were first formed. The PAP Town Councillors had no experience in municipal administration. But they had plenty of integrity and sense of responsibility. Mr Low said that we must, therefore, de-politicise the transitioning process. Newly elected Members of Parliament should not be tested, implying that they should simply be elected to oppose the Government in a First World Parliament, and not to have to show that they can actually govern.\nThis is the precise opposite of the philosophy of the Town Council scheme. Indeed, it is the opposite of what Mr Low Thia Khiang used to maintain, running Hougang Town Council for 20 years until the WP's team messed up in AHPETC: that, contrary to what the PAP thinks and claims, there is nothing to running Town Councils and the Opposition run them as well as any PAP Town Councils and, therefore, people should vote for them. Mr Low calls for the Town Council issue to be de-politicised, but he is politicking. How can he be disclaiming responsibility to govern locally while asserting the right to challenge the Government nationally?\nWhat is even more disturbing is what the WP Members of Parliament have been promising residents.\nLet me just quote three examples. The first quote: \"The Workers' Party has over 20 years of experience in managing Town Councils well. And not just small Town Councils, but a huge GRC Town Council in Aljunied. We know the ins and outs of running a constituency. Even when obstacles were thrown in our path to trip us up, we have still managed to ensure residents' needs are well taken care of.\" This was by Mr Gerald Giam when he spoke to residents at a rally on 23 January 2013.\nPage: 62\nEarlier on, we heard Mr Png Eng Huat spell out all the difficulties. But your fellow colleagues, your fellow Party Members, said, \"We know the ins and outs of running a constituency. Even when obstacles are thrown into our path to trip us up, we managed.\" But why are you attributing all the problems that you have to staff resigning, to difficulties, to challenges in the IT system, and so on? I do not understand.\nLet me move on to a second quote: \"If WP wins Punggol East, I am confident that we will manage the Town Council competently. WP has had more than 20 years of experience managing Hougang SMC. After GE2011, we quickly adapted to take charge of Aljunied GRC under a very short timeframe. We will take over the Town Council functions with as little disruption as possible to the residents. I have the experience and the know-how in running a Town Council.\" This was by Ms Lee Li Lian at the same rally to residents in January 2013.\nSo, we have heard that you can take charge of a Town Council, a big one too, under a very short timeframe. So, all the explanations that all the WP MPs have given us so far – which is the correct version? That you have plenty of problems, plenty of challenges or that you can take charge within a very short timeframe, that you can overcome any obstacle and that you have no disruption, and that you are experienced and have the know-how? Which is the correct version, may I ask?\nLet me mention a third quote: \"Workers' Party MPs are committed to being politically accountable to voters for town management under the current regime. Whatever else is done in other countries, the responsibility for town management has been legislated to the MPs under the TCA. We accept this responsibility and have pledged during elections to manage town councils entrusted to us to the best of our ability. We intend to continue keeping this promise.\" \"We accept responsibility... ...We intend to continue keeping this promise.\" This is by Ms Sylvia Lim in the Parliamentary session on 13 May 2013. So, as you can see, these are all quite recent.\nSo, I was most astounded to hear what Mr Low Thia Khiang said yesterday in this House – that we should de-politicise, we should look at the transitioning and all that. So, Mr Low, you are the Secretary General of the WP and have just said the exact opposite of what Ms Sylvia Lim, Chairman of the WP, said in this House in 2013. Did you just change your mind when things went wrong in AHPETC, or you never believed in what you were doing? Or were Mr Gerald Giam, Ms Lee Li Lian and Ms Sylvia Lim misleading residents when they made those speeches, and the WP had no intention whatsoever of fulfilling your promises? So, can you tell this House, and all Singaporeans, what are your real beliefs and values?\nPage: 63\nDo you have any conviction? Or do you just say whatever is expedient for the moment even if it means misleading Singaporeans? Is it not dishonest to claim that you believe in something and do the opposite, and to say one thing in one forum and a completely different thing on another occasion?\nThere also seems to be several versions of the WP floating around. Which one do we trust? The one that claims to be transparent and accountable, which wants to build a First World Parliament; or the one that politicks and says whatever is convenient? The one that politicks, like Mr Pritam Singh, who tries to avoid answering in Parliament but is prepared to say whatever he wants, and to whomever he wants, outside. So, which WP is the true WP?\nWhat is most disturbing in this entire sorry episode is the way that the WP has sought to downplay the crux of the matter, sought to deflect the issue by playing victim to a challenging operating environment that the Opposition faced and then claiming inexperience.\nLet me recount what happened in the House yesterday. Mr Low started with a clever opening to play victim – that the Opposition faced a challenging operating environment, and that is why they had these lapses. And then he insinuated that Town Councils are politicised, and he then took an entirely different line from what Ms Sylvia Lim and the rest of the Members of Parliament have been saying.\nMs Sylvia Lim went through a lot of details on the various AGO observations, circulated an action plan and promised to do better. Ms Lim said that Sinking Funds have been put back but she never told anyone of us that they were caught by their own auditor and then the AGO for not putting money into the Sinking Fund. They were forced to put the money back.\nMs Lim and the other MPs never answered the critical question – were all Town Councillors aware of the structure of the ownership of FMSS that leads to substantial over-payment, and was there a proper discussion on how you were going to safeguard the interests of the residents?\nAnd Ms Lim sought to show that the lapses were technical, bean-counting, and the WP would fix them by hiring more accountants and doing more checks. And then, of course, that is a dodge. And then, of course, we heard from the other Members of Parliament as well.\nMs Lim also circulated a table showing various committees and formal checks. Reading it, I was very impressed. I would like to point out to this House that the AGO report indicated that as of 12 December 2014, the last Finance and Investment Committee meeting was held in April 2014. They did not meet for eight months, but the table that Ms Lim circulated said\nPage: 64\nthey met monthly. This is in the AGO report – you can read that. So, is this another instance of saying one thing and doing another?\nSo, sadly, we saw – and today – we heard Mr Pritam Singh, we heard Mr Png Eng Huat – they explained all the technical details, they sought to deflect, but they never got to the heart of the issue. They never got to answer the questions that need to be answered. I was hoping that Mr Pritam Singh would change his mind and tell us today, but he did not.\nSo, we saw a big wayang in this House. Ordinarily, such a wayang would have been comical. But in the context of how important integrity and trust is in how we govern this little red dot, I am so disappointed, I am so saddened by this entire sorry saga. What we are seeing are not isolated lapses of behaviour. What we are seeing is a troubling pattern of dishonest misleading behaviour – to say one thing but to do the opposite. To say one thing that suits them to residents, then to say a different thing in Parliament or elsewhere when it suits them better.\nThis is wrong. This is a serious problem of integrity. It costs the WP nothing to promise the world. But there is a real cost to Singaporeans – real lives are affected – when they break their promises.\nLet me now conclude with why this Motion is important for all Singaporeans.\nAt the Ministry of Education and in our schools – tens of thousands of teachers spend many, many hours striving to provide the best possible education for our children, so that they may have a better future. Hundreds of thousands of parents are concerned about their children's future. We spend day and night thinking about our children's future. But our children can only have a better future if Singapore, as a nation, succeeds and remains relevant to the world. That we retain the values and the qualities that are essential for our success.\nWe have seen how in many countries – when elected officials engage in self-serving practices, when they put their interests ahead of the public interest, when they do not act with integrity and when they put the interests of their cronies first – the country fails. And it is the man in the street and the young and the future generation who suffer the most.\nAs a little red dot, good governance is critical to Singapore's future. Elected public officials must act with integrity and a deep sense of responsibility, and serve our people wholeheartedly. In the many decisions we take, there may be errors – human or system – but what matters most is that elected officials act with integrity and do our very best to serve\nPage: 65\nthe public interest.\nAs Minister Khaw Boon Wan pointed out yesterday, a Town Council requires elected Members of Parliament to govern and not just politick. It is easy to shout campaign slogans and make all sorts of promises, but do you really believe in what you say wholeheartedly and walk the talk? Running a Town Council in a clean, competent and accountable way is a test of the integrity of the Member of Parliament and his sense of responsibility and accountability. In other words, can we trust him or her?\nThis Motion is not about partisan politics – I have no joy pointing out the many failings and questionable practices of the WP. This Motion is important for all Singaporeans because it is about our long-term future. Unless elected Members of Parliament act with integrity and a deep sense of responsibility and take the trust of the people seriously, we will not be able to maintain a system of good governance – clean, honest, accountable, competent – and pass this on to our future generations. We must not betray the trust of Singaporeans. Singaporeans deserve better. So, let us all honour the trust that Singaporeans have placed in us. Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMr Low Thia Khiang.\n4.39 pm\nMr Low Thia Khiang\n:\nThank you, Madam. I have a clarification. I remember Minister mentioned that there was $12 million lost. May I clarify whether he meant $12 million lost from the Town Council's account? Does he mean that?\nMr Heng Swee Keat\n:\nMdm Speaker, I said that if you look at the accounts, $12 million was missing from the Sinking Fund, and this was caught by the Auditor-General.\nMr Low Thia Khiang\n:\nMissing from the Sinking Fund – was it missing or lost from the Town Council?\nMr Heng Swee Keat\n:\nI said that it was missing. I hope that you have read the AGO report because it was very clear that the $12 million that ought to be put into the Sinking Fund was not there, was missing from the Sinking Fund, and the Auditor-General had to say, \"You have to put this back.\" The rules are very clear as to when you have to put into the Sinking Fund. And even despite the reminders from the Auditor-General, you were late. And even now, not all of it has been put back.\nPage: 66\nMr Low Thia Khiang\n:\nThank you. So, it is the $12 million that ought to be put back into the Sinking Fund. The $12 million is in the operating fund account. [\nInterruption\n] But it is not missing from the Town Council.\nMr Heng Swee Keat\n:\nAs I have said, if not for the Auditor-General doing this audit, Singaporeans would have been kept in the dark about what happened to your Sinking Fund. Singaporeans would have been kept in the dark. The residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East would have been kept in the dark.\nMr Low Thia Khiang\n:\nMdm Speaker, I disagree. It will never be kept in the dark. You have to submit the audited accounts anyway. Yes, eventually, you will have to submit the accounts.\nMr Heng Swee Keat\n:\nThat is indeed so, that you have to submit the audited accounts. But you did not. Your accounts were late for two years in a row. The first audit had four disclaimers, and the second had 13. So, from year to year, it got from bad to worse.\nMr Low Thia Khiang\n:\nYes, it had not been submitted. We admit that, and we explained why it was so. And we are here today and yesterday in this House to explain and to account for why we were in the situation as it is. We take the report of the AGO very seriously. We have shown that we have dealt with the problem and improvements have been made.\nMr Heng Swee Keat\n: As I had indicated in my speech, Mdm Speaker, there are many issues on which the residents and Singaporeans deserve a straight answer. How is it that the Managing Agent rates that you are paying to FMSS are so much higher than anywhere else? Where did the money go? Where did it come from? And how was such a structure created in the first instance? And how did the financial position of the Town Council deteriorate so quickly within two short years? Those are the critical issues.\nWhy was FMSS set up? Why was it set up the way it was? First and foremost, whether the elected Members of the Town Council even disclosed this ownership to everybody in the Town Council? Was it debated amongst the Town Councillors, all of them, not just one or two of them? Were actions taken to ensure that proper safeguards were put in place? What happened to all the money? All these are critical questions.\nSo, we heard, indeed, we heard a lot of technical explanations which essentially gave the impression that this was a technical issue. As I had said, this is not a technical issue. This issue is about integrity. It is about trust. It is about our convictions and our beliefs. Our convictions and our beliefs that, as elected Members of Parliament, we are here to serve the\nPage: 67\npeople of Singapore, not our friends.\nMr Low Thia Khiang\n:\nMadam, we have explained yesterday and today the oversight mechanism of the Town Council, and that the Managing Agent contracts are tendered out. We tendered out the Managing Agent contract and this is the result of the tender. We have also done due diligence to look at the Managing Agent tender. So, this is what we have done. We have done our part. But, of course, we admit that the account is long overdue. We have accepted that and we accepted the AGO's finding, and we will look into the issue.\nMr Heng Swee Keat\n:\nSo, the question is: did the elected Members of the Town Council of AHPETC overpay? And do you accept that the figures that were circulated yesterday that, perhaps, you have overpaid by at least $1.6 million a year, over four years, to your Managing Agent? And if you do, and if you support this Motion fully, what action will you be taking to recover the monies? I think that deserves a straight answer.\nMs Sylvia Lim\n:\nMadam, may I?\nMdm Speaker\n: Yes.\nMs Sylvia Lim\n: Madam, first of all, I would like to clarify that what the Minister said about us not transferring monies into Sinking Fund until we were caught by the AGO, it is not correct. We actually made some transfers before even the AGO audit commenced. Of course, it is true that we did not make the transfers on time; it was not done deliberately. As I mentioned in the House yesterday, we thought that it was acceptable to keep the monies in the Operating Fund, pay Sinking Fund expenses out of there and then net the thing off. I think I said that in my speech. So, there was some misunderstanding of that on our part. But we admit that the rule, read strictly, is clear and that we should have done the quarterly transfer.\nSecondly, in respect of the Managing Agent rates, we actually did our checks at the time that the tender was awarded. We looked at the rates that were being charged. Although we noted that the rates were at a higher end, but we had the rates that were charged, for example, in Pasir Ris-Punggol from 2011 to 2014. And the rates that are in the Letter of Offer are actually higher than what was shown yesterday in the rates circulated by the Minister, and he clarified that these are the new rates.\nSo, it is possible that the Managing Agents have reduced their rates since then, but the information that we had in 2012, the rates were at a higher level than what was circulated in the table yesterday.\nPage: 68\nThe discussion was very detailed, the analysis of the Managing Agents rates. We looked at some factors such as: first of all, they were providing more staff than the previous Managing Agent; secondly, they are a company set up just to service us and we require them to operate quite a number of offices because of the boundaries of the town. Our town operated a total of five offices and one collection centre. So, it is quite a lot of administrative costs. And third of all, they are a company set up focusing on our work and, because of that, they may not have the same economies of scale as the larger companies that are running the other Managing Agents. So, these were some of the factors that we took into account.\nAdditionally, there was also the consideration that there were many additional lifts coming on stream, particularly in the Hougang SMC, which was experiencing the LUP all at once, and the lift testing fees were to be paid by the Managing Agent. So, these are some of the factors. The discussions were very frank and also based on the expected cost structure. We benchmarked the salaries that they were paying their staff; we got an HR consultancy to come in to see that it is within the market benchmark. So, we did exercise some due diligence on that.\nMr Hri Kumar Nair\n:\nThank you, Mdm Speaker. Can I just clarify with Ms Lim on that last answer? She said that some monies were transferred back to the Sinking Fund before the AGO came in and, therefore, they must know what the rules are. They would have only transferred back because they knew what the rules are. So, the question is why did they not transfer everything back before the AGO came in?\nMs Sylvia Lim\n:\nMadam, as I mentioned earlier, we were doing the calculation as to what Sinking Fund expenses had been paid out of routine funds. So, it took us quite some time to net off the thing. And AGO advised us later on that this is a complicated way of doing things. So, it took us some time to do that. But, as I mentioned earlier, we do agree that the transfers were late and it should not have been done late.\nMr Heng Swee Keat\n: Mdm Speaker, on the Sinking Fund issue, Ms Lim has basically said that the Managing Agent did not do a good job of it. But she had told this House in May 2013 that they were hired on the basis of their professional skills and experience. So, how did that happen?\nAnd on the rates that you quoted, and about all the due diligence that you have done, we are aware that FMSS is an exempt company, so the simple question is: did they make money and did the Town Council lose money as a result? So, never mind all the details about computations. But the heart of the matter is: did they make money? If so, are you prepared to say how much? And how much money did the Town Council lose, meaning how much\nPage: 69\nmoney did the residents of Aljunied, Hougang and Punggol East overpay?\nMr Low Thia Khiang\n: Thank you, Madam. Madam, these rates were through an open tender and awarded. That is the rate that they tendered for and we awarded the contract. Do you award a contract based on a certain rate agreed and subsequently you say they overcharged and you want the money back? I do not understand the logic.\nMadam, would the Minister agree that it would make all this confusion clearer and easier if, in the public tender for Managing Agent contract, there are more than one tenderer? That would be easier. Then, we will have to answer today in Parliament, \"Why are you not awarding the contract to the lowest tenderer?\" I think it would be much, much easier and not to confuse as to why you give it to your friend and all that.\nBut the fact is, unfortunately, the environment is such that there is no one tendering for the Managing Agent job. Nobody wants to work for me. That is a problem, Prime Minister. That is the environment we are in now.\nMr Heng Swee Keat\n: But Mr Low, I think we must remember one very critical detail, which is that the owner of FMSS – the General Manager, the Secretary and the Deputy General Manager – set up a company seven days after the General Election with a paid-up capital of $500,000. First of all, there is a very clear conflict of interest between what your Managing Agent, as owners, would do and what they as officers of the Town Council would do. You would surely agree that the incentives are very different when they are owners versus when they are just employees.\nSecond, for many, many years, Ms How and her team had been working with you in Hougang Town Council. You could have hired them as employees to do the work. In fact, as far as the cleaning, maintenance, services and all that, all the Town Councils outsource this work. So, there are plenty of big contractors all over Singapore who will be willing to do cleaning work, maintenance work, lift services work. And at the point when you terminated the CPG contract, it was pointed out in this House yesterday that the option rested with you. You could have extended it for another two years.\nSo, the issue that the elected Members of AHPETC need to explain is why did you not extend the contract, and why was a company set up as an exempt private company seven days after the election and, in fact, before you initiated discussions with CPG? In other words, the termination and the intention to set this up were, as Minister Shanmugam pointed out yesterday, premeditated. And did the company make money? I think I have asked this question many times but you have not answered.\nPage: 70\nMr Low Thia Khiang\n: I am not privy to the company's accounts; that is a private account, so I do not know. [\nInterruptions\n] Whether or not I will do that, I —\nAn hon Member\n: It is Singaporeans' money. How much money did your friends make?\nMdm Speaker\n: Can I advise Members to address the Chair when you are responding or making your clarifications and not to each other?\nMr Low Thia Khiang\n: To be fair, I think this is something which I have to respect; that is an individual company. Let us come back to the other question. Ms Lim has explained yesterday the circumstances under which CPG, I mean, we signed a deal with CPG to agree for the termination. They were not prepared to work for us.\nWhatever it is, you can question about why the company was set up. But the fact is that they were only given the transitional contract for one year, and there were two tenders subsequently called. So, there was no guarantee. If let us say, for instance, that I want to set up a company, go and find $1 million or $500,000 in capitalisation to do a specific job, there is no certainty that I will be able to continue to do the job. So, is there an incentive for them to do this, if there is intention for greed and money? There is no guarantee, because they will have to go through a public tender. That is why I said it would be easier if the public tender had more than one tenderer and the other tenderer shows a lower rate. And if we are not awarding to them, then I would have to answer here.\nMr Heng Swee Keat\n: Mdm Speaker, I think the hon Member has not answered the very straightforward question which I have posed, which is, yesterday we saw the big differences in the Managing Agent rates. As elected Members of Parliament running the Town Council, is it not in your instinct to say: \"How did this happen? Are our residents getting a good deal? Why is this so? How much money are they making?\"\nYes, it may be a single bid but is it not your responsibility to look at what happened? So, would you ask FMSS and FMSI how much profits have they made out of this contract over the last four years? Minister Shanmugam had said that the estimate is that the Town Council had paid at least $1.6 million more than you should every year for the last four years. So, if you are serving your residents well, should you not jump at that figure and say, \"I must do something about this. I must get to the bottom of this\"? Rather than to say, \"Well, this was an open contract, there was only one bid and that was that.\"\nAnd also, you did not answer my question which is, there were options. You said that they were experienced, they were professionals. Why did you not just simply hire them as employees and continue to run? You would know the cost with great clarity. You would know\nPage: 71\nhow much – because Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned about benchmarking. So, you would know exactly how much that you can pay Ms How and her team fairly, competitively and you would have avoided all these problems.\nBut you have not explained why such a convoluted structure and what you have done to prevent the conflict of interests. You are not prepared to ask how much money FMSS have made. You are not prepared to look into how much the Town Council has overpaid and is this money lost through the front door.\nMr Low Thia Khiang\n: Madam, I will reiterate again. The Town Council paid the Managing Agent based on the contract sum agreed upon via a public tender. Why we did not decide to manage ourselves was because it was a very much larger GRC. And at that point in time, in the Hougang SMC, there were about 20-odd staff and we know we would need about a hundred staff to manage. At that point in time, we were very concerned about taking over a much larger GRC. If you manage it yourself, you will probably have a lot of other things that you have to look into.\nSo, we thought it would be better that if the Town Council, the old Town Council's staff, I mean, they have the experience and are prepared to work with this company and are prepared to form a company or to manage the Town Council. They are prepared to do that.\nMr Heng Swee Keat\n:\nMdm Speaker, may I ask the hon Member whether it is perfectly alright to overpay his Managing Agent? Is that the Member's conclusion?\nMr Low Thia Khiang\n:\nMadam, what is there to decide on whether they are overpaid? This is a public tender, they tendered at that rate. We have done due diligence to check around about the rate.\nMr Heng Swee Keat\n: I think, Mdm Speaker, I find this discussion puzzling because, in fact, Ms Sylvia Lim had just, a few moments ago, told us that in terms of payment of staff, they had done a benchmarking. I assume that you did that to ensure that you do not overpay. Now that you have seen all the figures, it is a very clear instance that you have overpaid and the simple question is: \"What are you going to do about it?\"\nMay I suggest, Mdm Speaker, that we do not prolong this – where you just assert that, in form, there was a tender and this was the outcome and all that. As I said in my speech repeatedly, it is not about form; it is not about technical rules. It is about integrity, it is about trust, it is about how we wholeheartedly do our very best to serve the people who have elected us, to serve Singaporeans who have elected us. We should not just go behind the facade saying that the technical rules have all been obeyed, this was the outcome, and\nPage: 72\naccept that. Now, having seen the numbers, I think the public can conclude what ought to be done.\nMdm Speaker\n: Minister Khaw Boon Wan.\n5.04 pm\nMr Khaw Boon Wan\n: Mdm Speaker, over the last two days, we have heard several serious speeches on a serious topic. After all, this is the first time in our history that the Auditor-General had to conduct a special audit on a Town Council. Findings of incompetence and inadequacies in corporate governance were uncovered. The sorry state of affairs in the AHPETC's financial administration and its systemic nature bear grave implications not only for the residents but also for the sustainability and viability of the Town Council governance framework as we know it today.\nInstitutions that collect and spend public money must always ensure a high standard of transparency and accountability. Institutions are not perfect and there is always scope to improve. Occasionally, they may even make mistakes. Where there is criminal intent, the law will take its course. When mistakes are made, we expect the leaders in charge to take ownership and admit them and to promptly institute changes to avoid any repeat.\nI thank Minister of State Sam Tan and Mr Liang Eng Hwa for reminding the House of the honour and privilege of being elected Members of Parliament, and of our duties and responsibilities as Town Councillors. As Members of Parliament, we set the tone and the standard of corporate governance in our respective Town Councils. As the Chinese saying goes: “上梁不正下梁歪”. If the top beam is not straight, the lower beams are bound to be crooked. If the leader sets a bad example, or condones bad behaviour by his senior staff, the other subordinates will likely follow suit.\nMr Hri Kumar voiced his grave concerns over the poor state of affairs in AHPETC. He shared his years of experience dealing with wrongdoings in the commercial world and related them to the current saga. He highlighted the potential risks of abuses that the Town Council was in, if its weaknesses are left unrectified. He and others wondered how the Members of Parliament there could have allowed such lapses to happen and to persist for so long.\nIndeed, it is sad reading the Auditor-General's report, especially the appendices where AHPETC was asked to respond. Not only are the AGO's findings troubling, but the defensiveness of AHPETC in response to these findings suggests that instead of just taking ownership and to resolve to rectify the problems uncovered, AHPETC is constantly looking\nPage: 73\nfor excuses to mitigate and rationalise the lapses.\nBut it is sadder listening to their speeches yesterday and today. I was initially cheered by Mr Low Thia Khiang's declaration that WP would support the Motion. I thought, finally, they have acknowledged the mess they are in and their residents can now look forward to be eventually out of the hole. But my optimism was short-lived.\nHe went straight into a political speech, playing the victim of an unfair political world created by the Government and calling for the depoliticisation of the transition process. And soon after, Ms Sylvia Lim and their other Members of Parliament spoke, repeating their objections to the AGO findings, objections which were already rebutted explicitly by AGO and documented in the AGO report. They were recycled in this House in the hope, I presume, that not many people would have read the appendices where such exchanges were recorded. This consistent pattern of evasive behaviour gives us cause to doubt the sincerity of AHPETC Members of Parliament when they come to this House to declare their support for the Motion and assure that they will make necessary changes.\nMadam, I am a forgiving man. I listened very carefully to their speeches, hoping to find some trace of sincerity and genuine remorse. Sadly, I found none. Instead, there was a certain arrogance, a disdain for having to come and address this House to answer for the adverse findings of the AGO audit. Yesterday, Mr Pritam Singh's refusal to reply to our Law Minister Shanmugam's questions was classic: \"Well, Minister, if you were a resident, I will answer your question\"! If there is no remorse, there can be no genuine acceptance that one is at fault and that one is morally, if not duty-bound, to make things right.\nIt reminded me of my days running hospitals. Often, I got to meet some diabetic patients at risk of further complications leading to blindness, organ failure. Some of them were able to avoid the complications by taking charge of their illness, changed their lifestyle, ate healthily, more brown rice, exercise regularly. But, unfortunately, for some, even as they assured their doctors of compliance – \"Yes, I will do this; I will improve\" – actually just lived in denial, only to see their health continually deteriorate. And because I stayed in the Ministry of Health for so many years, I got to see those patients eventually and, predictably, ending up with chronic kidney failure, as dialysis patients. It was very sad and could have been avoided. They only realised it when the organ finally failed, but it is too late.\nMadam,\tI would urge that AHPETC come out of denial and see the gravity of the situation for what it is. The AGO findings are not trivial. The lapses are symptomatic of a systemic failure: the failure to have proper controls and a reliable record and accounting system. This is the staple that every Town Council must have in order to operate. How else can you safeguard public monies? Indeed, the AGO's conclusions are that until those weaknesses are addressed, AHPETC cannot safeguard public monies; its accounts are\nPage: 74\ninaccurate and unreliable.\nIn 1989, when we created the Town Councils, then-Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong explained in this House that the strategic intent was to empower elected Members of Parliament to be responsible for and be a part of governance of Singapore. It is to allow the Members of Parliament to demonstrate to the residents their ability to govern. All political parties, we assume, must aspire to eventually run the Singapore Government. Now, if they cannot even run a Town Council well, how can they be entrusted with the even more critical responsibility of running the whole country?\nBy vesting the Town Councils with powers to manage the HDB estates, the Government hands over significant authority to the Members of Parliament: powers to set and enforce by-laws; powers to collect S&CC; and the authority to procure and deliver programmes and services for their residents. A dysfunctional Town Council can have grave consequences for the residents.\nIn the past 25 years, there have been Town Councils run by PAP, as well as by Opposition Members of Parliament. While there were occasional hiccups, the Town Council framework has generally served us well. This is because there was a common understanding that each Member of Parliament would assume his duty of running a Town Council seriously. There was also a common understanding of the role of Town Councils that, while they exercise autonomy, they are not sovereign bodies above the law. They must work in keeping with national policies, national interests and the law. They are certainly not a local warlord, above the law and accountable to only themselves.\nThe AGO audit findings confirmed the sad state of the situation at AHPETC. At the core of this tragic saga is the incompetence of its Managing Agent, FMSS. Its incompetence spawned the many symptomatic lapses that the Auditor-General had observed in the Town Council.\nFMSS, as we heard yesterday, is very highly paid. And what a sterling service the FMSS has rendered the Town Council! It cannot even deliver a competent reliable system and administration of accounts and records. Without a reliable accounting and financial management system, there will be financial and accounting lapses and opportunities for fraud, abuse and wrongdoing. And in such a setting, when wrong-doers dip their fingers into the pie, the acts may not be discovered for a long time. If I may quote another Chinese saying: “混水摸鱼”, that is, \"When the water is murky, it is easier to fish.\" In other words, opacity creates opportunities for crooks to make money. Eventually, the financial health of the Town Council will be placed at risk. This can only be at the expense of the residents.\nPage: 75\nThat is why we require all organisations to prepare fully audited financial accounts, unqualified. Unfortunately, we all know now, the Town Council had not been able to do so for several years. I think Mr Liang Eng Hwa put it quite succinctly – FMSS has severely short-changed the Town Council. The residents there pay more and get less!\nMinister Shanmugam probed further and asked about the financial position of FMSS, and whether FMSS would publish its accounts. Minister Heng did the same thing just now. And, as we heard, there was no reply. But I bet that FMSS is one of those rare companies which are profitable from Year One. And if my guess is correct, we can safely assume where the husband-and-wife team places their priority. To preserve the peace with the residents, they work on the visible aspects of Town Council work: cleaning the floors, maintaining the lifts. And in any case, such work is not done by them. It is outsourced to external contractors and, in fact, FMSS is paid to oversee them.\nAs for the invisible aspects of Town Council work that residents do not get to see, like corporate governance, accounting procedures, timely payment into the Sinking Funds, and reducing operating deficits, they probably figure that such things, being out of sight, can wait. But this is also at the expense of the residents, though the effects may not be obvious immediately. It is only as a result of their own auditor's disclaimers, and now the deeper findings of the AGO audit, that we have sight of the mess that they have been hiding from all of us.\nMinister Shanmugam gave us a vivid analysis of the intrinsically troubling structure of FMSS and its relationship with AHPETC. He is our Law Minister. He said in this House that the structure is downright unlawful and that it is a serious breach of fiduciary duties for any Town Councillor to have approved such a process. Inflated fees were paid to FMSS, in return for gross incompetence, placing the Town Council's financial health at risk. The excess fees paid to FMSS, we have heard, were estimated at $1.6 million per year. So, in four years, it is $6.4 million; $1.6 million per year, $6.4 million for four years.\nIn three short years, the Town Council's finances deteriorated from a $3.3 million surplus to a deficit of almost $¾ million. In short, FMSS and its owners who, de facto\n,\nrun the Town Council have milked it, and residents' money and public funds have, in this manner, been abused. That was the conclusion and the statement by Minister Shanmugam.\nSo, in this House yesterday, he asked the elected Members of Parliament whether they were aware of this governance structure and process. No answers, whether collectively or individually. Instead, we were inundated with speeches over several hours on minutiae details, details which are already recorded in the appendices of the auditors' report; minutiae details which they have also offered to the Auditor-General, and many of which had been rejected by them. But they recycled it here and conveniently kept silent on the key\nPage: 76\nquestions put up by the Minister for Law.\nWP MPs have made light of the AGO findings when they asserted yesterday that AGO had found no evidence of loss of money or fraudulent activity. But as we have now heard, this is a misrepresentation of AGO's conclusions. Mr Hri Kumar highlighted this point, too. AGO pointed this out in Appendix A of its report when the WP tried to put such words in AGO's mouth. AGO did not draw such a conclusion, that there was no loss of money or fraudulent activity. In fact, with so many documents missing, and the accounts unreliable, who can be sure that there was no wrongdoing?\nInstead of making such an assertion attributing a conclusion to the AGO audit which, in fact, the AGO had categorically rejected, Mr Low or Ms Sylvia Lim should just roll up their sleeves and do real work: mount a serious forensic investigation, as suggested by Mr Hri Kumar, into the records and pursue all the findings of the AGO report, clean up the accounts, correct the flawed structure, institute a robust system, discipline any errant officers, get the Managing Agent to return the money, explain to their residents. They have a lot of work to do.\nWhile the incompetence of FMSS, the Managing Agent, caused all these problems, it was, in the end, only the proximate cause. The primary cause was, unfortunately, the dereliction of duty by the Town Councillors, condoning this, allowing it to happen, and then making excuses for it when uncovered, instead of putting things right. Only they, the Town Councillors, can unwind the mess. If I may borrow another Chinese saying: “解铃还需系铃人”, that is, \"Only he who attached the bell can remove it.\"\nThe systemic failure at AHPETC resides in the arrangement that they have allowed – the de facto management of AHPETC being also the owners of the Managing Agent, resulting in the adverse outcome of over-charging and the obvious ineffectiveness of any oversight by the Town Councillors. The result is the deteriorating financial health of the Town Council, with all signs suggesting it is only going to get worse this year and the next. If a listed company had such an auditor's report, the Chairman of the company would be duty-bound to investigate and to satisfy himself and his shareholders whether fraud or criminal conduct was involved. In this instance, the ball is in the WP's court.\nRegardless, we must not allow FMSS to profiteer from their incompetence. All the more when it is at the expense of residents and public monies. Even if it was not illegal, it is morally wrong. Mr Low should not condone this. He should hold his Managing Agent accountable. I expect him to take action against FMSS for their monumental incompetence. That would be the right thing to do. Mr Hri Kumar was helpful and described a road map forward for them\nPage: 77\nto follow.\nMeanwhile, I welcome Mr Low's support of the Motion. But he must walk the talk. If I may borrow the Minister for Law, Mr Shanmugam's words, as he put it yesterday. It cannot be just lip service, a convenient way of sliding past this debacle, to live and fight another day. Demonstrate your sincerity through real actions. There is another Chinese saying for this: “听其言，观其行”, that is, \"Watch his actions, even as you are listening to his words.\"\nHow to show sincerity?\n(a) Take concrete steps to recover the losses that they have allowed to take place. Make restitution to the residents for the losses to their Town Council.\n(b) Submit a clean set of accounts for FY2013 to Parliament by 30 June this year. Submit your accounts for FY2014 on time, like all the other Town Councils, by 31 August this year. Account to Parliament, account to your residents, here, in this House.\nAnd these are not high hurdles. These are the basic requirements for any organisation, for anyone seeking to run for office in any organisation. Every Town Council has been able to do this, including those run by Opposition MPs in the past. This is what supporting the Motion means.\nMr Liang Eng Hwa said that he would call for a Division when the vote on the Motion is taken. I support his call. This is a matter on which it is important for each one of us to take a stand explicitly.\nMdm Speaker, this has been a very painful debate. But if our discussions have given us pause to reflect on our responsibilities as Members of Parliament and as Town Councillors, and strengthened our resolution and determination to do better, regardless of which party we belong to, then something good may yet come out of all this.\nLet us support the Motion. This Motion is not about PAP versus WP. This Motion is about Singaporeans. This Motion is about our residents.\nLet us do our very best to uphold high standards of governance, transparency and accountability so that we can protect their interests. Let us do our best to protect and safeguard all the public monies that have been entrusted to our Town Councils. Madam, I beg to move.\nPage: 78\n5.30 pm\nMdm Speaker\n: Ms Sylvia Lim.\nMs Sylvia Lim\n:\nThank you, Madam. I would just like to clarify with the Minister on what he mentioned about requiring the Town Council to submit unqualified or clean accounts for the next two years by a certain deadline. As the Minister would have noted in the AGO report, there were a couple of disclaimers that were highlighted. Some of them had been cleared. Some of them we will put in efforts to clear them. But there may be a few which will remain, such as operating balances and so on. So, I just hope that we can work with MND to come up with something satisfactory for MND to accept.\nMr Khaw Boon Wan\n: Madam, I am a reasonable man. I am also a generous man. I am also a very religious man. So, where possible, I will try to help, whoever. It does not matter whether you are PAP or non-PAP. The key point is: are you sincere in wanting to help your residents? If you are honest, if you are clean, I will do my best to help you.\n[(proc text) Question put. (proc text)]\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Liang, you wish to say something?\nMr Liang Eng Hwa\n: Madam, I call for a Division.\nMdm Speaker\n: Instead of claiming a Division, would you prefer to have your vote recorded instead?\nMr Liang Eng Hwa\n: Madam, I call for a Division, please.\nMdm Speaker\n: Will hon Members who support the Division please rise in their places?\n[(proc text) All hon Members rose. (proc text)]\n5.32 pm\nMdm Speaker\n: Okay, Members, you can sit down; looks like everybody has stood up. Clerk, ring the Division bells.\n[(proc text) After two minutes – (proc text)]\nPage: 79\nMdm Speaker\n: Serjeant-at-Arms, please lock the doors. The Question is, \"The Motion standing in the name of the Minister for National Development.\" Mr Liang, you have claimed a Division, would you like to proceed?\nMr Liang Eng Hwa\n:\nI call for a Division.\n5.34 pm\nMdm Speaker\n: Take a Division. Before I proceed to start the electronic voting, Members are advised to read the instructions for voting, which are found in the left compartment of their seats, where their earpieces are placed. Do not forget to press the button that you are \"Present\". Otherwise, your vote will not be reflected. You may now begin to vote.\nMembers are advised to check that their names are registered on the display board according to your vote indication.\nThere are a few Members who have not pressed their \"Present\" button. The Clerk will now proceed to call your names so that you can indicate your vote.\n[(proc text) Hon Member Mrs Lina Chiam was called. (proc text)]\nMrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member)\n: Yes.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Thomas Chua.\nMr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member)\n:\nAre Nominated Members allowed to vote?\nMdm Speaker\n:\nYes. You are allowed to vote. Can you please indicate your vote so that we can record it manually?\nMr Thomas Chua Kee Seng\n: Yes.\n[(proc text) Hon Member Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam was called.  (proc text)]\nThe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)\n:\nYes, Madam. I had already voted \"yes\".\nPage: 80\nPage: 81\nMdm Speaker\n:\nThere are 85 \"Ayes\", nil \"Noes\", nil \"Abstention\".\nThe \"Ayes\" have it.\n[(proc text) Resolved, that this Parliament: (proc text)]\n[(proc text) (i) notes with concern the Auditor-General's Report on the Audit of Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC) (Paper Misc 1 of 2015), specifically its findings on: (proc text)]\n[(proc text) (a) the deficiencies in AHPETC's financial and accounting systems, record-keeping and safeguards; (proc text)]\n[(proc text) (b) the uncertain accuracy and reliability of AHPETC's accounts; (proc text)]\n[(proc text) (c) the lack of proper disclosure and oversight by AHPETC's Town Councillors, especially over related-party transactions and conflicts of interest; and (proc text)]\n[(proc text) (d) the risk that AHPETC has not properly managed and spent public funds; (proc text)]\nPage: 82\n[(proc text) (ii) calls on all Town Councils to uphold high standards of accounting, reporting and corporate governance so as to safeguard residents' interests; and (proc text)]\n[(proc text) (iii) supports strengthening the legislative framework for Town Councils, in order to hold those responsible for their good management to proper account. (proc text)]\nPage: 83",

    "content": "1\nMr Gerald Giam Yean Song\nasked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the average monthly annuity payment, by decile, that will be drawn by CPF LIFE members once they reach the drawdown age in 2015; and (b) what is the average monthly annuity payment forecast for the next three years based on extrapolating current trends.\nMr Tan Chuan-Jin\n: Central Provident Fund (CPF) members turning age 55 from 2013 with at least $40,000 in their Retirement Account (RA) at age 55 or $60,000 in their RA at age 65 will be automatically included in CPF LIFE. Mainstream members in the first cohort to be automatically included will only commence their monthly payouts from CPF LIFE from 2023. CPF members who are currently receiving a monthly payout from CPF LIFE have chosen to opt in.\nFor the cohort of CPF members who reached their drawdown age of 63 in 2014 and are eligible to draw down on their savings, 15% have opted into CPF LIFE. The median monthly CPF LIFE payout among them was $394. It is not meaningful to extrapolate future CPF LIFE payouts for successive cohorts because the distribution of payouts is dependent on the average balances of members who have chosen to opt in. However, CPF balances have been improving over time, and CPF LIFE payouts for successive cohorts will also increase correspondingly.\nPage: 85",
