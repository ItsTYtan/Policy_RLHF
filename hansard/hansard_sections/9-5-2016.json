    "content": "1\nMr Darryl David\nasked\nthe Minister for Transport whether the Government will consider setting up dedicated bicycle terminals at key locations in the city and downtown with the necessary facilities to support those who would like to cycle from their home to the city.\nThe Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport)\n: Mdm Speaker, congratulations and welcome to Mr Murali Pillai, and also, belated wishes to you, Madam, and all the mothers, \"Happy Mother's Day\".\nIn answer to the Member Mr Darryl David, there are currently more than 800 bicycle parking lots at eight Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations located in the city area. For the Downtown Line, which is the newest line to be operational, bicycle parking lots will be provided at a majority of the stations in the city area.\nThe Land Transport Authority (LTA) also plans to require bicycle parking standards for private residential, commercial and community developments, including those in the city area. Besides parking, developers will soon have to submit a Walking and Cycling Plan which factors in other supporting facilities for cyclists, such as showers and lockers.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Darryl David.\nMr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)\n:\nI would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for her reply. It is heartening to know that this is going to happen, but until the developers provide these facilities, I was wondering whether under the\nUrban Redevelopment Authority (URA)\nor LTA, we could consider  providing those lockers, showers and facilities\nat the dedicated bicycle hubs or terminals\n. Many of us would like to try to cycle to work, but due to our weather, by the time we get there, whether we are caught in the heat or in a storm, we are drenched. Would the Government consider this?\nMrs Josephine Teo\n: In response to the supplementary question, there are really two considerations. One is that at the sites where the MRT stations are located, we need to have the available space in order to carry out a plan like dedicated bicycle terminals. The second consideration is that when we provide bicycle facilities, we must bear in mind the objective, that is, first- and last-mile connectivity. That is why the intention is to involve building owners. Even if you have provided a bicycle terminal, the individual will still have to get to the destination. That, ultimately, is going to be a building with an owner. So, we prefer to require these owners to implement Walking and Cycling Plans so that facilities can be nearer to the destinations of the bicycle users.",

For existing stations, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is expanding the number of bicycle parking spaces progressively, starting with the stations with the most acute shortage. LTA will also be seeking powers to mandate bicycle parking standards for private residential, commercial and community developments.\nAt the moment, we have no plans to provide storage facilities for personal mobility devices. Users tend to carry the devices with them. We will, however, continue to monitor the trends.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Ang Hin Kee.\nMr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio)\n:\nMadam, I read with great interest the Walking and Cycling Plans for new developments that developers have to put in place. For existing developers, are there items or schemes that\nthe Ministry of Transport (\nMOT) may consider encouraging them to also do likewise, so that they can provide especially storage facilities? I have visited and met some personal mobility device users who tend to carry their devices, whether e-scooters or hoverboards, to training classrooms or gyms. They have to move around with those equipment because there is no other proper place to store them.\nMrs Josephine Teo\n:\nMdm Speaker, as I had explained earlier, for existing buildings, it is a little harder to require retrospectively the owners to make such provisions available. Within the building, there could already be constraints. I think it is quite clear to the building owners that as the number of users increase, as part of their friendliness towards the tenants in the building, they would want to make such facilities available. We will continue to monitor the trends. The priority is to require new buildings to do so and where opportunities arise and it is possible for us to encourage existing building owners to do likewise, we will do so.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Pritam Singh.\nMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)\n:\nJust a supplementary question for the Senior Minister of State. For new Downtown Line stations, can I just confirm with the Senior Minister of State how many bicycle parking facilities will be made available at each station?\nMrs Josephine Teo\n:\nI do not have the answer offhand. That is very detailed, but the Member could file a Parliamentary Question, we will provide it to him.",

Since 2013, the CPE includes a key module on counter-extremism by the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG). Through this module, the RRG shares with asatizahs its experience in rehabilitating and reintegrating former Jemaah Islamiyah members into society. Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) and RRG will continue to update this module to ensure its relevance and aim for every asatizahs to attend it. Currently, 80% of our asatizahs are part of ARS and we will encourage the remaining 20% to come on board.\nMany asatizahs have visited the RRG Resource and Counselling Centre (RCC) at Khadijah Mosque since its launch in 2014 to learn first-hand RRG's efforts in tackling extremist ideologies, especially those on social media platforms.\nThe RRG also engages our secondary and post-secondary madrasah students on the threats of radicalisation and extremism through platforms, such as learning journeys to the RCC and the Madrasah Pre-U Seminar. The Madrasah Pre-University Seminar is attended by all secondary and pre-University madrasah students and is held every two to three years. MUIS will continue to strengthen the madrasah curriculum with relevant content developed by the RRG.\nMdm Speaker\n: Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef.\nAssoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)\n:\nI thank the Minister for the response. Can I also ask whether we could encourage or make it part of the programme for our mosque committees, including the youth committees in our mosques, to attend and get to know about the work of the RRG? For the asatizahs mentioned earlier, are those who are qualified or trained overseas required to understand what RRG does?\nAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim\n:\nMdm Speaker, if they are registered under the ARS, as mentioned in my reply, whether they are overseas graduates or not, they will have to go through the CPE and that would include the component on the work of the RRG. To the Member's first question on whether or not we encourage mosques and youth groups to do so, we do that all the time. Mosques are free to arrange their own programmes. In fact, since the RRC was opened in 2014, there have been many, many visitors, not just from the religious fraternity but also from other groups, because we want to encourage a greater understanding across the whole cross-section of Singapore society.",

    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "4\nMs Joan Pereira\nasked\nthe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether the Ministry will consider encouraging major tourist attractions to charge special rates for multi-generational Singaporean visitors to promote intergenerational bonding.\nThe Senior Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Sim Ann) (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth)\n: Madam, currently, many places of interest in Singapore already offer special entry prices for seniors who are above 60 years of age and children below the age of 12. This encourages multi-generational outings. Examples of attractions that offer such tiered pricing include the Singapore Zoo and Singapore Science Centre. Some attractions, such as the Art Science Museum, have special promotions for those who visit as a family. We will encourage attractions to continue to develop ways to promote intergenerational bonding among Singaporean families.\nFor places of interest and facilities under the the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) family, we encourage multigenerational visitors through family-oriented programming. The museums run by the National Heritage Board (NHB), including the National Museum of Singapore (NMS) and Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) already offer free entry to Singaporeans for the permanent galleries. Their exhibitions particularly lend themselves to intergenerational bonding. The National Heritage Board also organises the annual Singapore Heritage Festival and Singapore Night Festival which have family-friendly activities, such as performances and guided tours.\nIn the heartlands, ActiveSG members who are below the age of 18 and those 55 years and above enjoy special rates for entry to ActiveSG gyms and swimming complexes. Concessionary rates are also granted to senior citizens and their accompanying immediate family members using selected public sports facilities during specified hours on weekdays.\nThere are many other platforms to encourage intergenerational family bonding. These include a wide range of regular community events and free-access public spaces such as the Marina Barrage and popular parks such as Singapore Botanic Gardens and East Coast Park. The Families for Life Council also organises regular picnics at these and other heartland parks to encourage intergenerational family bonding.",

    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "5\nAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong\nasked\nthe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with regard to heritage artefacts excavated by archaeologists or others in the last five years (a) whether all the artefacts have been properly documented and reported to the Government; (b) what is the legal ownership status of such artefacts; and (c) how are the artefacts stored and protected.\nThe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)\n: Mdm Speaker, all archaeological materials unearthed on state land belong to the state. This includes most archaeological excavations conducted in recent years, such as the excavations at the National Gallery of Singapore in 2010 and Empress Place in 2015.\nWhen commissioning archaeological excavations, the National Heritage Board (NHB) makes it a requirement for the agencies conducting the excavation works, such as the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS)-Yusof Ishak Institute, to document and submit reports on the archaeological finds to NHB.\nImportant archaeological materials from these digs that support the interpretation of Singapore's history have been accessioned into the National Collection managed by NHB on behalf of the Singapore Government. They are carefully documented and conserved at the Heritage Conservation Centre (HCC), when not on display. Remaining artefacts may be stored by partner agencies, such as the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\nNHB typically does not have legal ownership of archaeological materials unearthed on private land. NHB has, nevertheless, worked closely with stakeholders to identify and protect important artefacts. An example from the past five years would be artefacts recovered from the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd, which are owned by the Roman Catholic Church. A number of artefacts recovered from the Cathedral are displayed at the Cathedral's Heritage and Resource Gallery. Selected artefacts are also displayed at the Indian Heritage Centre, managed by NHB, for the public to access and appreciate.\nThe legal ownership status of archaeological materials unearthed on private land is an area that NHB is studying as part of a broader review on archaeology in Singapore. The review will seek to better support the conduct of archaeology in Singapore, and address any gaps in our laws, regulations and norms. NHB will seek feedback from stakeholders, such as archaeologists, heritage experts and non-government organisations (NGOs) in its review.\nMdm Speaker\n: Assoc Prof Daniel Goh.\nAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member)\n:\nI thank the Minister for the reply. I have a few supplementary questions. The first is: what are the guidelines for the storage or protection of these artefacts for the partner agencies? Is the same process of protection and storage applied to territorial waters in archaeological finds that are discovered in territorial waters? And what happens when members of the public discover traces of archaeological finds, especially during property construction and renovation? Is the Ministry going to consider imposing legal obligations for stopping work and reporting the finds to the Government?\nMs Grace Fu Hai Yien\n: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. NHB will work very closely with the related agencies on the standard of protection and record keeping. I must say that right now, we are working with very good professionals who themselves have a great interest in protecting the artefacts and there is a close collaboration on ensuring that the artefacts are well kept and protected for all to appreciate in the future.\nOn maritime archaeological finds, this is generally supported by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) through the Merchant Shipping Act. We are working closely also with MPA with regard to maritime archaeological finds. We place great importance on maritime artefacts. We display maritime artefacts in the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), for example. And with the support of philanthropists, such as the Khoo Teck Puat family foundation as well as Kwek Hong Png's family, we are able to have good displays for the public to appreciate such finds.\nWith regard to the public, as I have answered earlier on, this is an area that we are looking further into. We are looking at how we should improve our laws and regulations to not discourage the public from having an interest, but to embrace and engage the public who are interested in archaeology to cooperate with NHB. Ultimately, I think we share the same common purpose. It is to understand the history of Singapore through archaeology. And that history is really for the public, both present and future generations, to appreciate. So, we want to keep artefacts as evidence of history for the benefit of many generations to come.",

    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "6\nMr Lim Biow Chuan\nasked\nthe Minister for Defence whether the National Day Parade Organising Committee will consider allowing greater priority for Pioneer Generation citizens when they apply to ballot for National Day Parade tickets.\nThe Senior Minister of State for Defence (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for Defence)\n: Madam, the National Day Parade (NDP) is a major event in the national calendar and receives tremendous support from Singaporeans. It is heartening that Singaporeans are eager to be part of the celebrations, with the number of ticket applications for NDP overwhelmingly exceeding the seats available each year. This year, we expect about 165,000 Singaporeans to be able to watch the two previews and the parade on the actual day, or three times more than past NDPs, at the Marina Bay Floating Platform or the Padang. This is facilitated by the larger seating capacity of the National Stadium as well as the additional preview session.\nIndeed, the Pioneer Generation should be honoured and thanked for their sacrifices, achievements and immense contributions for building the Singapore we know and have today. However, as a national celebration for all Singaporeans, it is important that every Singaporean be given an equal chance to attend the NDP. We are mindful that preferential allocation of tickets would not be in line with this intent to include all Singaporeans as part of the nation's birthday. As it is, while the number of available tickets has increased, so will the number of applicants and it is inevitable that many will still be disappointed. To give greater priority to the Pioneer Generation, or about 450,000 Singaporeans, will lead to reduced chances for other Singaporeans.\nSo, the NDP Executive Committee (ExCo) endeavours to include as many Singaporeans as possible to experience NDP. As with previous NDPs, live telecast will also allow Singaporeans to watch the show at home. Singaporeans can also look forward to participating in NDP through the engagement efforts which the ExCo will unveil in the coming months.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Lim Biow Chuan.\nMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)\n:\nMdm Speaker, I have a question for the Senior Minister of State. The feedback that I have is that many residents say that they have balloted many times for the NDP tickets but have never been successful. Would the Ministry consider, for those who have never ever successfully balloted before for an NDP ticket, just to give them the opportunity to experience NDP live in the stadium, can they be given, say, triple or double chances, just to give them the experience?\nDr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman\n: Madam, I can appreciate where the Member is coming from. I think we all would like to give everybody the opportunity to experience NDP. It is going to be quite difficult to ascertain who has never ever had a chance to attend an NDP over the last 50 years of our Independence. It is going to be quite a difficult process to put in place in the first place. What we have done is that, since 2013, those who have been successful in balloting in one year are then taken off the register for the subsequent year. So, we try to give opportunities for those who have not balloted successfully in one year to ballot again the next year. Those who have been successful in that year will not be allowed to ballot again the next year.\nSo, that is the best we can do to try to limit access of one group who has succeeded in one year, and possibly expand the opportunities for the others. But I think Mr Lim Biow Chuan would probably appreciate that it is going to be very difficult to first ascertain what is that frame of number of people who have \"never ever\". And everybody would probably say \"I have never ever been successful\" because we cannot possibly ascertain that. Because everyone who ballots or applies for tickets can apply for one, two, four or six tickets. So, the success is by one person, but six persons would have gone. So, it will be very difficult to ascertain that. I think the system we have today is fair and we will continue to try to facilitate a fair system where everybody gets an equal chance of being balloted for the tickets.\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMiss Cheng Li Hui. Sorry, Mr Ang Wei Neng. You have a question?\nMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)\n:\nIt is a supplementary question, Mdm Speaker for the Senior Minister of State. Instead of one year of barring, that is, if you are successful in one year and you cannot benefit next year, why not extend it to three or five years, for that matter? Is this a system's constraint or our own constraint?\nDr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman\n:\nI guess the argument would go either way. One would say, \"Barring me for one year is sufficient. I try again. It is not that I am going to get the chance of getting successful one more time.\" But it is from feedback that we have put in place this system of barring them for one year. We can study it further; we can study the probability of one being successful even if we had blocked them for two or three years. The point we recognise is that we want to give Singaporeans the opportunity to get access to the NDP. This year, for example, more will get a chance because the capacity is bigger, and we will look into the system and facilitate as much as we can.",

    "content": "7\nMiss Cheng Li Hui\nasked\nthe Acting Minister for Education (Schools) whether the Ministry will consider extending compulsory education up to GCE \"O\" or \"N\" levels in preparing our youths to meet future challenges.\nThe Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng)\n: Madam, the Ministry of Education (MOE) introduced Compulsory Education only at the primary level in Singapore in 2003, following the recommendations of the Committee on Compulsory Education. The committee had also deliberated whether secondary education should be made compulsory, and Parliament discussed this when the Compulsory Education Act was introduced. Legislating Compulsory Education does not ensure full enrolment in schools or solve the root problems of non-attendance, as these are often complex and multifaceted in nature.\nInstead, MOE has taken a holistic approach by working with parents, schools, community self-help groups and relevant agencies, such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the Family Service Centres (FSCs), to support families and help all students attend school. This includes tracking and helping students who are at risk of dropping out of school or those who are already out of the school system.\nWe also focus on upstream efforts, such as ensuring that children attend primary school regularly, to get a good start in education. With a solid foundation in the early years, our children are well-placed to progress to and access a secondary and post-secondary education.\nIn addition, we recognise that regular school attendance is necessary but insufficient for real learning to take place. MOE, therefore, also invests in providing multiple pathways and a variety of programmes in our schools to cater to students of different learning needs, strengths and talents, so that every student is able to learn at a pace most suited to him or her and has the opportunities to develop his or her strengths and is well-prepared for further progression in education and work. The quality of their school experience helps to keep our students interested and engaged in school, to strive for excellence in their respective domains.\nWith these collective efforts, Singapore has achieved near-universal secondary education. Today, as it stands, less than 1% of each Primary 1 cohort does not complete secondary education. A legislative extension of compulsory education is unlikely to be effective in reducing this any further. To prepare our youths for future challenges, MOE will continue to support our children in their education at every stage by providing a quality education and meeting their needs.",

As a general rule, IRAS does not waive income tax liabilities. You need to have some financial prudence and discipline but, at the same time, you also need to balance that where individuals generally want to pay but for some reason, their circumstances really, really do not allow them to. So, the best approach is to speak to IRAS.\nCurrently, they do have interest-free instalment plans. They would try, where possible, to exercise flexibility. But at the end of the day, we have to do two things: maintain the fiscal prudence and discipline in tax recovery for the state and, where possible, balance that with compassion on the part of individuals.",

    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "9\nDr Tan Wu Meng\nasked\nthe Minister for Health (a) whether private insurers can be incentivised to offer riders for basic standard B1 Integrated Shield Plans to cover Singaporeans with pre-existing medical conditions; and (b) whether the Ministry will study the possibility of establishing a reinsurance risk pool across private insurers' basic standard B1 Integrated Shield Plans so as to lower premiums and facilitate extension of coverage to pre-existing medical conditions.\nThe Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health)\n: Mdm Speaker, the Ministry of Health's (MOH) focus is to provide affordable basic health insurance to all Singaporeans. This is done through MediShield Life which offers adequate protection for the vast majority of subsidised patients. Its claim limits are sized to fully cover 90% of hospital bills for patients staying in B2 or C class wards. MediShield Life also provides lifelong coverage for Singaporeans with pre-existing conditions. This is made possible by the Government bearing most of the cost of extending MediShield Life coverage to these Singaporeans.\nLike all Integrated Shield Plans (IPs), Standard IP is an optional private insurance. Currently, IP insurers are allowed to offer riders for coverage of pre-existing conditions. The premiums for these riders are set by the insurers based on commercial and actuarial considerations. As the Government's focus is on providing basic health insurance for all Singaporeans through MediShield Life, we do not have any plans to incentivise insurers to offer such riders. We have to be prudent in extending subsidies and incentives beyond MediShield Life, as the cost increases will ultimately be borne by taxpayers.\nOn Dr Tan Wu Meng's suggestion to establish a reinsurance risk pool, MOH will explore this proposal with the industry players. I thank the Member for his suggestion.\nMdm Speaker\n: Dr Tan Wu Meng.\nDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)\n:\nI thank the Minister of State for his answer. If I may ask three supplementary questions. Firstly, would the Minister of State agree that different pre-existing medical conditions have different implications for risk? Secondly, would the Minister of State agree that in an ideal insurance market, pre-existing conditions will have an incremental price for coverage, rather than the insurer refusing to provide cover at all, which is the case that many of my residents have told me when they sought to obtain additional cover beyond MediShield Life? Thirdly, would the Minister of State give his view on whether the Ministry has a role in preventing market failure within the private healthcare insurance industry?\nMr Chee Hong Tat\n: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. For his first question on whether different pre-existing medical conditions will have different risk implications, the answer is yes.\nThe second question is whether we would look at allowing insurance companies to provide coverage for pre-existing conditions and charge different premiums. I would like to clarify that since MediShield Life was launched on 1 November 2015, we have allowed IP insurers to offer risk-loaded policies where individuals with pre-existing conditions can obtain coverage by paying additional premiums. The premiums will be calculated based on commercial and actuarial considerations, according to the different risks which different pre-existing conditions carry. Importantly, I think it is also useful for us to remember that pre-existing conditions today are already covered by MediShield Life, which is the basic health insurance that we have provided for all Singaporeans, for life.\nAs for the third question, I think the Member is asking about whether we would look at measures if there is market failure. Certainly, we would study this carefully with the industry and to make sure that the insurance scheme is working well for Singaporeans.",

    "content": "10\nDr Tan Wu Meng\nasked\nthe Minister for Health (a) which private insurers cover admission to inpatient hospices as part of their Integrated Shield Plans; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider requiring all private Integrated Shield Plan insurers to cover inpatient hospice admission, just as they presently cover restructured hospital admissions.\nThe Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health)\n: Mdm Speaker, hospice care, or end-of-life care, is available in an inpatient hospice or in the home setting. Together with MediShield Life, the Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) are designed mainly to cover large hospital bills. Hospice care is covered under some riders, such as Great Eastern's Total Health Riders or AXA's Home Care Riders. So, we do have some riders that are covering hospice care today. The Ministry of Health (MOH) does not require IPs to cover hospice care, as an expansion of IP benefits will, inevitably, result in higher premiums for all policyholders.\nIn assessing whether palliative care should be covered by IPs, we also need to look at whether the services are affordable for most Singaporeans. Based on data collected by MOH, hospice care is affordable through a combination of Government subsidies, charity dollars and MediSave. About eight out of 10 inpatient hospice bills did not require out-of-pocket cash payment while about nine in 10 home palliative care patients did not have to make out-of-pocket cash payments for their care. Needy patients who require further assistance can receive financial support through MediFund.\nMOH regularly reviews the amount of Government subsidies and MediSave used for hospice care to ensure it remains affordable for patients and also sustainable for providers. We are also working with community partners to enhance accessibility to palliative care services by increasing capacity for palliative care across the inpatient, home and community settings.\nMdm Speaker\n: Dr Tan Wu Meng.\nDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)\n:\nI thank the Minister of State for his answer. Would the Minister of State agree that there is a group of patients who may fall into what some of us term the \"sandwich class\", who might not qualify for as many subsidies as lower-income patients but, at the same time, would still want to take advantage of the benefits provided by their IPs purchased from the private sector when they were healthy?\nWould the Minister of State agree that, at the moment, the present system makes it somewhat unfortunate that these patients can access their IP benefits in a restructured hospital but cannot, should they choose to seek end-of-life care at an inpatient hospice?\nMr Chee Hong Tat\n: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Today, Government subsidies for hospice care, both inpatient hospice care as well as home hospice care, are extended up to the 67th percentile. In addition to Government subsidies, the other important source of support for our patients would be charity dollars. This is an area where we work closely with voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) and charities, and they bring more than financial support. They also bring care and concern, and service from the heart, which is very important for end-of-life care.\nThe point about IPs and riders, we do have riders that are available, as I explained in my answer. The important point is that this is something which we will have to regularly review. We just started MediShield Life from 1 November last year. It is important for us to focus the scheme on the original intent in which it was set up to do, which is to cover large hospital bills. This is something we can review on an ongoing basis to make sure that MediShield Life is able to meet the needs of Singaporeans.",

The objectives of the two Acts are different.\nThe Animals and Birds Act seeks to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases through animals, control the movement of animals, prevent cruelty to animals, and safeguard the general welfare of animals in Singapore. On the other hand, the primary intent of the Road Traffic Act is to ensure the safety of road users, including motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.\nThe specific provision in the Road Traffic Act relating to animals had been confined to farm animals of commercial value. The original intent of that legislation was to ensure restitution to their owners should an accident occur.\nThe question is whether we should now mandatorily require all motorists to stop, should they hit an animal. The primary requirement must be safety. They should stop, if it is safe to do so. If the motorist requires assistance in relation to attending to the animal, he can contact the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) or Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs intends to review the definition of \"animals\" in the Road Traffic Act and also consider any amendment in the context of road safety, especially the safety of the motorists and other road users. In response to the Member's question, yes, we will review.",

This Office brings together all the existing efforts and programmes to help retiring officers. As the unit is newly set up, there are no statistics available as yet on its work.\nThe new CTO will give greater focus in our efforts to help retiring Police Officers secure good jobs after they leave the Police Force. Even before the CTO was set up, the Police Force has for many years been organising training programmes in areas, such as resume writing, job interview techniques and entrepreneurship skills, to help our retiring officers in their job search. In addition, Police would also share job opportunities from other Government agencies and Ministries when these Ministries and agencies approached Police to recruit retiring Police Officers. Over the past three years, about 300 Police Officers have received training for their post-retirement job search.\nWith the Police CTO, we will be able to do more. Efforts to help retiring Police Officers will be stepped up and done more purposefully. The Office will proactively source for suitable job opportunities for retiring Police Officers. The office will also provide career counselling to prepare our officers psychologically for the job search and the transition from uniformed to civilian life; equip them with new skills that are in demand; and actively reach out to prospective employers where our officers' experience and knowledge would be valued, for example, companies which need professionals with expertise in contingency and security planning, regulatory compliance and enforcement. The office will also collaborate with partners such, as the Workforce Development Agency (WDA) and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to tap on their experience in these areas.\nBesides the Police, other Home Team departments will also structure similar services for our retiring officers.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Desmond Choo.\nMr Desmond Choo (Tampines)\n:\nI thank the Senior Minister of State for his comprehensive answer. One supplementary question. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State what is the percentage of retired officers who have been re-employed within the Home Team? Among those who are not offered re-employment, what are the key reasons and how would the new CTO assist them?\nMr Desmond Lee\n: Madam, over the last three years, and this is before the CTO was set up, on average, about 110 or so Home Team uniformed service officers retired. Of these, about 60 would be from the Police Force. About 60% of these retiring officers each year would be re-employed within the Home Team, whether it is back within the Police Force or other parts of the Home Team. The remaining 40% either did not take up the offer or were not offered re-employment for various reasons. Some, for example, would prefer to strike out on their own and do something different.\nThe CTO endeavours to serve every single retiring officer to provide them with skills, provide them with job offers and to make sure that they are taken care of after retirement.",

    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "13\nDr Lim Wee Kiak\nasked\nthe Minister for Law (a) whether the Government will review the current annual disposable income criteria for a person to qualify for legal aid; (b) what are the reasons for applicants failing to qualify for legal aid; and (c) among applicants who qualify for legal aid, what are the broad categories of their cases.\nThe Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Law)\n: Madam, legal aid is an important aspect of access to justice in Singapore. To qualify for legal aid in civil matters, under the Legal Aid and Advice Act, applicants will have to satisfy a means test.\nThe means test is satisfied where the applicant's disposable income is not more than $10,000 per year and he or she has not more than $10,000 of disposable capital. The Ministry of Law regularly reviews the means test to ensure that those who are unable to afford to hire a lawyer can still obtain legal advice or representation. In 2013, the Act was amended to allow approximately 25% of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents to qualify for legal aid under the means test, up from 17% previously. At the same time, the Director of Legal Aid was also given a new discretion for family proceedings which involve children or protection orders to ensure that the most vulnerable persons in a family dispute are eligible for legal aid. We will continue to monitor and review the criteria for the means test regularly.\nFor applicants who satisfy the means test, legal aid will be granted if the Legal Aid Board is satisfied that the applicant has reasonable grounds for taking, defending, continuing or being a party to the proceedings. The applicants who were granted legal aid were helped in a wide range of civil matters. Around half of the cases were matrimonial matters such as divorce and applications for custody of children, and a further 15% to 20% of cases involved property or estate matters or claims. A more complete list of services offered by the Legal Aid Bureau can be found on its website.\nMdm Speaker\n: Dr Lim Wee Kiak.\nDr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)\n:\nMadam, let me thank the Senior Minister of State for her reply. I would like to ask one supplementary question regarding those who are rejected based on their failing the means test. What are the avenues for appeal, and can they appeal to Legal Aid for help and whether\nthere are any other avenues that they can go to?\nMs Indranee Rajah\n: Madam, if an applicant has made an application and has been rejected, one has to ask the reason why. If it is because the person has failed the means test, then it would be really quite difficult for the Legal Aid Bureau to accede because the parameters are set, and the Legal Aid Board cannot waive those parameters of their own accord.\nHowever, if it is a means issue and you do not fall within the legal aid means test, there are other possibilities. Provided that the person cannot afford his or her own lawyer, he or she could be referred to the Pro Bono Services Office of the Law Society where, on a case-by-case basis, the Law Society may accede to a request for assistance where it is not legal aid as such, but they would try to find lawyers who may be willing to do it at an affordable rate. So, the Pro Bono Services Office is one option.\nThere is another option. This is located in the State Courts itself. It is called the Community Justice Centre. It is a charitable organisation but it is working on this joint project with the State Courts where lawyers contribute their time and service on a discounted basis. You can go to the first floor of the State Courts, take a left turn, the office is there. They will direct you to the place to go accordingly.\nSo, these are for people who fall through the gap, if you like, where they cannot easily afford their own lawyer but, at the same time, do not meet the means test for legal aid.\nIf the reason for rejection happens to be that they do not meet the merits test, then that would be really quite difficult because, obviously, they do not have a good case. It would not be useful to pursue the claim when there is no merit.",

    "content": "14\nMs Joan Pereira\nasked\nthe Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry can consider increasing the parking duration for Class 2 Label Scheme drivers on parking lots for the handicapped, from 60 minutes to two hours.\nThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development)\n: Madam, the Carpark Label Scheme was introduced to assist persons with physical disabilities to board and alight from a vehicle. Class 1 labels allow drivers with physical disabilities who drive to park in accessible parking lots. Class 2 labels allow caregivers to park temporarily at the accessible lots for 60 minutes so that they can assist passengers with physical disabilities to board and alight. Once their passengers alight and are in a safe place, the caregivers are to vacate the accessible parking lots and move their vehicles to standard lots.\nThere have been some suggestions to lengthen the 60-minute duration for Class 2 label holders. We have considered these suggestions. In deciding on the allowable duration for Class 2 label holders, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the Ministry of National Development (MND) have to take into account the needs of all Class 1 and Class 2 label holders for accessible parking lots. With our ageing population, the number of Class 2 labels issued has also been increasing significantly. We believe that 60 minutes provide a reasonable amount of time for caregivers to ensure that passengers with physical disabilities alight and are in a safe place. Lengthening the time would make it more challenging for other label holders to seek accessible parking lots.\nMdm Speaker\n: Ms Joan Pereira.\nMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)\n:\nMadam, I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his detailed reply. I have one supplementary question. Would the Ministry consider granting a separate licence, maybe Class 2A, that will allow the holder a longer parking duration time? This could be given on a case-by-case basis, with emphasis on elderly caregivers looking after persons with multiple disabilities.\nAssoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim\n:\nMadam, I thank the Member for the supplementary question. As I mentioned in my answer earlier, Class 2 labels cater to the caregivers of the disabled person, where it allows caregivers to park at an accessible parking lot for up to 60 minutes. We have received several suggestions from members of the public as well, and we would just like to share that in deciding whether to extend or not, we have to look at the needs and demand of all label holders because they are all sharing this shared space.\nWe believe that the 60 minutes given is a reasonable time for the caregivers to board and alight the persons with disabilities, bring that person to a safe place and, following that, go back to the vehicle to park it at the standard lots. We feel that extending the time will create a challenging process and increase the time taken for label holders to find accessible lots.",

    "content": "15\nMr Chong Kee Hiong\nasked\nthe Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider having water rationing exercises twice a year to instil in our citizens and residents the importance of water and inculcate responsible water usage behaviour in view of the persistent drought and diminishing water levels in Linggiu Reservoir.\nThe Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)\n: Mdm Speaker, I share the Member's view that we need to inculcate responsible water usage among our residents. While we have planned ahead to ensure that our water supply is adequate, we need to enhance our resilience against the uncertainties brought about by climate change. Encouraging prudent use of water is an important thrust of our effort.\nWe believe that good habits are best cultivated when young. As such, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) collaborated with five schools to conduct water rationing exercises this year during the Singapore World Water Day celebrations. Our aim is to reinforce the value of water among our students, starting from young, and inculcate the habit of saving water early. We plan to do this again and we encourage more schools and other organisations to join us next year.\nIn addition, PUB has worked with the Ministry of Education to include water conservation topics in the social studies syllabus for Primary 3 students. It also devised a \"Time to Save\" programme where primary school students learn and practise water conservation.\nAs for the wider community, PUB has been carrying out extensive outreach and educational programmes. We have also mandated water efficiency labelling and minimum standards to help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and adopt more water-efficient fittings and appliances. Moving forward, PUB will be carrying out studies to gain a deeper understanding of households' water usage patterns so as to better design and implement outreach programmes. For example, PUB is working with the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) on the Smart Enabled Homes Trial in Yuhua estate for 2016-2017, and this will provide households with hourly water consumption data and water saving tips, and alert them on anomalies in water usage. Given these outreach programmes, both at schools and in the community, it may not be necessary to conduct water rationing exercises with households at the moment.\nThe responsibility of water conservation does not fall on households alone. Businesses must also play a part. We have mandated the submission of Water Efficiency Management Plan (WEMP) for large water users in the non-domestic sector. Through these plans, businesses can better understand their water usage and establish water management systems to enhance their water efficiency. PUB will study the data collected from these plans and explore the potential for water efficiency benchmarks and good practice guidelines for the different sectors.\nAll of us have to do our part to conserve water. This way, our water resources can last longer. Every effort counts and, collectively, the amount of water saved can be significant.",

    "content": "16\nMiss Cheng Li Hui\nasked\nthe Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether NEA will consider imposing a ban on the use of styrofoam packaging in hawker centres in view of its detrimental effects on the environment.\nThe Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources)\n: The majority of our hawker stalls use reusable crockery. However, disposable wares made of polystyrene foam, commonly known as styrofoam, are still used by some hawkers to serve food and pack food for takeaways, due to its good thermal insulation and convenience.\nPolystyrene foam packaging is of concern in some countries where waste is landfilled, as it is non-biodegradable, and consequently, remains in the landfill for a long time. In Singapore, however, all incinerable waste, including polystyrene foam packaging, is incinerated safely at waste-to-energy incineration plants, which are fitted with pollution control equipment.\nNevertheless, we recognise that there are benefits in switching from polystyrene foam packaging to more environmentally-friendly options, such as using reusable crockery for dining in and having consumers bring their own containers to pack food for takeaways. The use of reusable crockery also avoids the problem of disposable plates being blown off tables and helps reduce the overall waste volume.\nMy Ministry will continue to look into ways to discourage the use of disposable tableware in hawker centres. However, this would have to be weighed against practical challenges, such as the cost of alternatives and greater inconvenience to hawkers and consumers.\nMdm Speaker\n: Miss Cheng Li Hui.\nMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines)\n:\nI thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I would like to know what the costs and benefits of using the alternative materials are, since cost was mentioned, and when is the Ministry targeting for hawkers to be using the alternatives?\nDr Amy Khor Lean Suan\n:\nWe have done a cost-benefit analysis internally for some of the commonly used disposable wares, as well as using reusable crockery. Basically, for commonly used disposable wares in the hawker centres, the cost of the other types of disposable wares, for instance, plastic containers or coated paper box or even the \"tze char\"\npaper box, they are about two to three times higher in cost than the clamshell polystyrene foam packaging. But using reusable crockery, including taking into account the cost of manual collection and washing of reusable crockery, is actually more cost-effective and relatively cheaper, compared to using styrofoam packaging. As I have said, we do not face this problem about Styrofoam packaging being landfilled as it is incinerated.\nWe are working with the hawkers, through the hawker associations and stalls to discourage them from using disposable wares, including polystyrene foam packaging, as much as possible. But we need to take into account the cost of alternative options, as well as manpower constraints for these hawkers and the inconvenience that may be caused. As much as possible, we will encourage them to not use disposable wares, particularly for dining in.",

    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "17\nAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong\nasked\nthe Minister for Manpower (a) what is the definition of \"severely impacted life expectancy\" to apply for an early withdrawal under the CPF Medical Grounds Scheme; (b) whether the definition can be brought in line with the Life Insurance Association's Critical Illness Framework or the equivalent for transparency reasons; and (c) what is the reduced Retirement Sum for calculating the withdrawal amount and how is it derived.\nThe Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say)\n: Mdm Speaker, Central Provident Fund (CPF) members with serious medical conditions can apply for an early withdrawal of CPF savings under the CPF Medical Grounds Scheme. The four criteria are: having a terminal illness, permanent incapacitation, suffering from an unsound mind, and having a severely impaired life expectancy.\nIt is not appropriate to adopt the Critical Illness Framework of the Life Insurance Association as the definition for severely impaired life expectancy, as suggested by the Member. This is because not all their listed medical conditions would result in a severely shortened life expectancy, for example, loss of hearing or loss of speech. Conversely, there may be medical conditions which are not on their list but could still result in a severely shortened life expectancy. We, therefore, require members who wish to make withdrawals on any of these four grounds to have their medical conditions certified by doctors either from public medical institutions or on the CPF Board's panel. In the last two years, the CPF Board approved about 1,000 applications each year.\nCPF members who are terminally ill will be able to withdraw all their retirement savings in one lump sum. Members who are permanently incapacitated, suffer from an unsound mind or have a severely impaired life expectancy will be able to make a lump-sum withdrawal from their retirement savings after setting aside a reduced Retirement Sum. Currently, it is $40,300, which is about half the current Basic Retirement Sum.\nMdm Speaker\n: Assoc Prof Daniel Goh.\nAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member)\n: I thank the Minister. Is there an existing list of ailments that lead to severely limited life expectancy available for the public to consult so that they know how to apply for the scheme?\nMy second question is: is this application process accessible to people from all walks of life, especially the elderly who cannot understand English well, and what may be done to make this scheme more accessible to them?\nThe third question is regarding the $5,000 cap for the fourth criterion. How long ago was this cap of $5,000 established and whether there were considerations to increase the cap, given the higher cost of living these days?\nMr Lim Swee Say\n: Mdm Speaker, firstly, whether there is a list, the answer is no, because it is not possible to have a complete list. Any member who wishes to apply for the scheme, all they need to do is to go and see a doctor on our panel. We have a standard form for the doctor to do the certification. CPF Board will basically abide by the assessment of the medical expert.\nThe second question was about accessibility. Every year, we have 1,500 applications. So far, we have not heard of any feedback on lack of accessibility. When members need to use their money in the CPF prematurely, they will come to the CPF Board. They do not wait for us to reach out to them. Firstly, we do not know who they are; secondly, once they need the money, based on our experience, they will come. Therefore, we do not think accessibility is an issue.\nThe last point is about the $5,000 cap. If I understand the Member's point correctly, he is asking whether we should raise the $5,000 cap. I would hesitate to do so because how the cap works is this. A member, having set aside the reduced Retirement Sum and if the balance is less than $5,000, then they do not qualify under the scheme because the amount is too small. So, in other words, if we were to raise the sum, more and more of them will be deprived of this concession. Therefore,  for now, I will just keep it at the $5,000 mark.\nMdm Speaker\n: Assoc Prof Daniel Goh.\nAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong\n:\nJust to clarify. For successful applicants for withdrawal of CPF on medical grounds, they can either withdraw the higher of up to $5,000 or the savings after setting aside. So, the cap is actually the higher amount that they can withdraw. Therefore, it is not that they will be unsuccessful if they have less than $5,000 in their CPF.\nMr Lim Swee Say\n: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the clarification. On balance, it is about allowing them to withdraw more in lump sum versus keeping some of them for their monthly withdrawal. Our assessment is that for members who are able to meet the reduced Retirement Sum, which currently is set at $40,300, just to put it into perspective, they would be able to withdraw a monthly sum of only $550 which is derived from the Department of Statistics Household Expenditure data for lower-income households. The amount of $550 will be just sufficient to meet their basic requirements.\nAnother piece of information is that at $550, the amount of $40,300 can last about seven years. It is not all that long. In other words, on the part of CPF, we really have to strike a balance between allowing the member to draw more as a lump sum versus having some of these savings to support their monthly expenditure. On balance, we think $5,000 at this moment, is about the right amount.",

    "content": "18\nMr Leon Perera\nasked\nthe Minister for Manpower what enforcement powers does the Ministry deploy when investigating referrals from TAFEP about employers who may be engaging in discriminatory HR practices that are not related to nationality but to other attributes, such as age and gender.\nThe Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Teo Ser Luck) (for the Minister for Manpower)\n: Mdm Speaker, we have employment laws that enforce against employers with discriminatory practices on age and gender. Under the Retirement and Re-employment Act (RRA), an employer cannot dismiss an employee on the grounds of age. The Employment Act (EA) and Child Development Co-Savings Act (CDCA) also protect female employees from being dismissed without sufficient cause during any stage of their pregnancy.\nThe Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Tripartite Partners also expect employers to implement fair and non-discriminatory employment practices in accordance with the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP). This is why TAFEP, as the advocate and champion for fair employment practices, takes an active role in looking into complaints of such unfair employment practices and refers cases to MOM for enforcement, if found to be true.\nMOM takes a serious view of all forms of employment discrimination and, if employers are found to have engaged in such unfair employment practices, MOM will take appropriate enforcement actions under the RRA, EA or CDCA. MOM can also suspend their work pass privileges under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. Any employee who feels discriminated against can approach TAFEP for assistance.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Leon Perera.\nMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)\n: I thank the Minister of State for his detailed and comprehensive answer. I just have a few supplementary questions.\nFirstly, has MOM had cases referred by TAFEP or from any other source where employers were allegedly engaged in discrimination for personal attributes, other than age or gender, for example, physical appearance or any other kind of personal attributes? In such cases, what were the tools of enforcement used?\nSecondly, have there been any cases of employers who have not been amenable to persuasion or pressure from MOM in such cases and are recalcitrant and refuse to actually amend their discriminatory practices in any way?\nMr Teo Ser Luck\n: I thank the Member for the questions. So far, we have received complaints of other attributes besides nationality, age and gender. We have received complaints based on attributes, such as race, language, religion, family status and others. Most of the time, we will investigate, gather the evidence and I am encouraged that most of the companies rectified their employment practices.\nFor complaints related to attributes besides nationality, for example, age and gender, the number has remained stable. Age- and gender-related complaints accounted for about 20% of total complaints in 2015. We are monitoring the situation and will work with TAFEP closely. Whenever there is a complaint and a need to investigate, we will do so.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Patrick Tay.\nMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast)\n:\nI wanted to ask the Minister of State, bearing in mind that we have the RRA, the EA, as well as the CDCA, would MOM look at implementing specific workplace-related anti-discrimination laws as a final option, if and when cases of discrimination do increase in the coming years?\nMr Teo Ser Luck\n:\nWe are monitoring the situation closely. So far, the number of complaints has remained stable. What we will do is to continue to educate and create greater awareness. TAFEP, as an advocate for fair employment practices, is enhancing and strengthening its educational efforts. We believe that this approach has worked so far as most employers engaged by TAFEP did rectify their employment practices.",

    "content": "19\nEr Dr Lee Bee Wah\nasked\nthe Minister for Transport whether the Tesla Model 3 electric car will be entitled to a rebate under the Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS).\nThe Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)\n:\nMadam, Tesla Motors has just launched the Tesla Model 3 in the United States on 31 March 2016, and only a prototype was displayed. When it is ready to be sold in Singapore, the importers will have to submit its electrical energy consumption information for\nthe Land Transport Authority (LTA)\nto assess if it will attract a rebate or a surcharge. If it is as energy efficient as a new Tesla S, a new Tesla 3 car would be entitled to the maximum rebate under our current\nCarbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS).\nEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)\n:\nI thank the Minister for his answer. I would like to ask: why is it that there was such a hoo-ha about the Tesla in the previous case? Why is it that there was no rebate?\nMr Khaw Boon Wan\n: I suppose Tesla, being a sexy and iconic product, attracts attention. But I think what was lost in the debate was that that particular unit was a second-hand Tesla. In other words, if it were a new Tesla Model S, it would have enjoyed the maximum rebate of $30,000. But for all imported second-hand cars, whether electric or otherwise, we have a duty to require the second-hand car to be retested to find out what exactly is the fuel consumption or the CO\n2\nemission rate, so that we can apply the rebate or surcharge properly.\nAs an engineer, the Member would know that the condition of a car, after being used for a while, depends very much on how well you maintain it and how well you use it. And its fuel efficiency can vary quite a lot.",

    "content": "20\nEr Dr Lee Bee Wah\nasked\nthe Minister for Transport (a) what is the Ministry's position on use of electric cars in Singapore; (b) whether there are plans to offer financial incentives to encourage more motorists to use electric cars; and (c) whether the Ministry will install more charging points for electric cars.\nThe Minister for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)\n: Madam, we encourage the use of vehicles that are more environmentally-friendly, or green, including electric cars. And that is why we incentivise low carbon emission cars through the Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS), which we have just had a discussion earlier. CEVS is outcome-based and neutral with respect to the type of technology used.\nThe Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Economic Development Board (EDB) had earlier issued a Request for Information (ROI) to invite proposals for a nationwide electric car-sharing programme. Besides trialling electric car-sharing services, the programme will also see the installation of 2,000 charging points across Singapore. The proposals are in the final stages of evaluation.\nAll that said, the greenest form of transport is public transport. So, do follow my example. If you cannot be a 100% public transport user, at least be a part-time public transport user. It is a little bit like being vegetarian. If you cannot do 100% like me, even 初一,十五, just twice a month, is good. [\nLaughter.\n] So, at least one day a week, I use public transport throughout the day. And sometimes, I do it two days a week. The greenest form of transport is public transport. Even though electric cars produce no tail-pipe emissions, the process of generating the electricity they consume emits carbon dioxide. We must move towards a car-lite Singapore.\nMdm Speaker\n: Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.\nEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)\n:\nMadam, I would like to ask the Minister on the 2,000 charging points, whether it is only for those in the car-sharing scheme, or any member of the public can use the charging points. I think not everybody would like to join the car-sharing scheme.\nMr Khaw Boon Wan\n:\nMy favourite Member of Parliament has caught me on this tiny little detail! I am not sure, I got to check. I suppose it will apply to the trial participants of the car-sharing scheme, but as the facilities are out there and if other people would like to use them, they may charge them for its usage. I do not know. They may charge the battery, as well as charge the user, I think.\nMdm Speaker\n: Ms Sun Xueling.\nMs Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)\n:\nA supplementary question. I understand that London launched the world's first fully electric-powered double-decker bus in March this year. Would the\nMinistry of Transport (MOT)\nconsider using electric vehicles for public transport?\nMdm Speaker\n:\nMinister, question about London introducing the new electric bus.\nMr Khaw Boon Wan\n:\nMy apologies. I thought we have moved on to the next Parliamentary Question. Can the Member please repeat the supplementary question?\nMs Sun Xueling\n:\nI understand that London launched the world's first fully electric-powered double-decker bus in March this year. Would MOT consider using electric vehicles for public transport?\nMr Khaw Boon Wan\n:\nThe answer is yes. Eventually we will try to make use of all this new technology. I covered those points during my reply in the Committee of Supply debate, that driverless vehicles and the use of greener fuel like electricity, should all be explored. In fact, besides the trial project involving 2,000 charging points and car-sharing, we have two other trials which are going on. One is for buses; one is for taxis, and commercial trucks. We certainly intend Singapore to be among the early adopters, if not among the early pioneers on the use of such technology because we are a city, compact and, especially for electric vehicles, you can cover a long distance with a single charge. I read that for Tesla Model 3, they are talking about covering almost 400 kilometres with one charge. At that rate, you can drive all the way to Kuala Lumpur.",

    "subTitle": null,
    "sectionType": "OA",
    "content": "21\nDr Lim Wee Kiak\nasked\nthe Minister for National Development (a) over the last three years, how many HDB flats have been approved annually for subletting within the Minimum Occupation Period; (b) what is the duration of the subletting approved by HDB; and (c) how many applicants have been allowed to renew their sublettings after the first approval.\nThe Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong)\n: Madam, flat owners have to fulfil the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) before they can sublet their flats. However, some may have specific reasons to sublet their flats within the MOP, for example, because of full-time work assignments overseas. In such cases, they will have to put up an application to the Housing and Development (HDB), which will then assess the request on a case-by-case basis. Each approval to sublet within the MOP is for short periods of one or two years. And when these flat owners reoccupy the flat, they will have to make up for the period of subletting to fulfil the MOP.\nOver the last three years, HDB granted an average of 785 approvals each year to flat owners to sublet their flats within the MOP and this is about 2% of the total subletting approvals each year. Of these approved cases for subletting, an average of about 110 cases were granted an extension each year.\nMdm Speaker\n: Dr Lim Wee Kiak.\nDr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)\n:\nLet me thank the Minister for his reply. Frequently, during block visits or even during coffeeshop walks itself, I always hear residents complaining to me that certain units may have been bought by certain residents. When they quote Permanent Residents who bought the units, but never stayed in the unit which has been rented off from day one, I am sure there have been some stories like that coming in, sort of complaints. How many of these cases have come to\nthe Ministry of National Development (\nMND), and how many of them have been convicted, or, if they are caught, what are the consequences for these owners who flout this MOP ruling?\nMr Lawrence Wong\n:\nMadam, if there are indeed cases of infringement, people who have flouted the MOP rulings, and residents suspect that their neighbours may be doing so, please alert HDB and HDB will certainly take enforcement action. Many times, when these cases or when we have had people making representations and we go to check, they are, in fact, legitimate subletting approved by HDB. But if there are cases where Members in the House have feedback from their residents, please encourage them to let HDB know, and we will not hesitate to take enforcement action.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Pritam Singh.\nMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)\n:\nJust a supplementary question for the Minister. The Minister identified individuals who essentially take up assignments overseas as one of the reasons which the Ministry assesses when they grant deviations from the MOP policy. What are some of the other common reasons which the Ministry assesses before it allows for the deviation of this policy?\nMr Lawrence Wong\n:\nWe look at every case on its own merits. In fact, the most common reason for allowing is for work overseas. That is usually the most common reason why HDB would agree to a request to subletting within the MOP period, that means, the person having bought an HDB flat, for some reason, employers request them to work overseas and then that is a valid reason.\nThere may be other reasons like family circumstances, parents or somebody who has fallen sick for extended periods of time, a resident would appeal on a sympathetic or compassionate basis to want to move to take care of an elderly father or mother and would like to do that for a year or so. So, there could be various other reasons like these. And, like I said, we will look at it case-by-case and, if it is valid, HDB would want to support and provide room and leeway for the residents to be able to do so, on the condition, as I have said, that they would then have to make up for that period after they return to their flat.",

    "content": "22\nMr Yee Chia Hsing\nasked\nthe Minister for National Development whether the Ministry is looking into the root cause of the recent HDB coffee shop fires and whether warranties for floor tiles of units above the affected coffee shops can be provided to these residents.\nThe Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development)\n: Madam, there are various possible causes for these fires. These include excessive open flames from cooking stoves, poor housekeeping of stalls or poor maintenance of the exhaust system.\nThe Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) investigates the cause of all reported fires and may, if necessary, introduce new guidelines to enhance fire safety at the coffeeshops.\nIf residential units are affected by fire in the coffee shops, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) will inspect these flats and assess what damage may have been caused.\nUnder HDB's tenancy agreement or memorandum of lease with coffeeshop tenants or lessees, the tenant or lessee is liable for any damage arising from acts of negligence. Should a fire break out, HDB will require the tenants or lessees of the coffee shops to follow up with the necessary repairs, including to the floor tiles of units above the affected coffee shops.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Yee Chia Hsing.\nMr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang)\n:\nI thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. I have two questions. One, which agency is responsible for ensuring the proper maintenance of the exhaust system? Two, many residents want to have more coffee shops, but few residents understand the inconvenience of staying above the coffeeshop units. Some of the visible damage is repaired post the fire incident but residents have actually given feedback that, for example, the floor tiles, it may not be visible right after, and the cracks may appear like six months or a year after. Will they then still be able to claim from the coffee shop tenant?\nMr Desmond Lee\n: On the first question, it is the responsibility of the tenant of the coffee shop, the lessee, to make sure that their exhaust duct is kept clean. SCDF has guidelines and if they are found not to be complied with, action will be taken.\nAs for the second question, I do not think the Member is referring specifically to popping tiles which occur after a fire has broken out. That will be a clear nexus. But if he is referring to other circumstances where these things occur after a period of time, then you need to look at whether it is within the warranty period. If it is, then they can be replaced. But if it is many, many years, even a decade down the road, and these things occur, we need to really look at what the cause of it is.",

    "content": "23\nAssoc Prof Fatimah Lateef\nasked\nthe Minister for Health what is the Ministry's progress on initiatives pertaining to public-private partnerships and whether there are plans for a wider rollout.\nThe Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health)\n: Mdm Speaker, the Ministry of Health (MOH) recognises the private sector's role in meeting national healthcare needs. We have forged closer collaboration between the public and private sectors in recent years.\nIn primary care, MOH introduced the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) in 2012 to strengthen our partnerships with general practitioners (GPs) and dental clinics in providing subsidised primary care for Pioneers and about half of Singaporean households. We now have about 900 GP clinics and 650 dental clinics participating in CHAS. Last year, 650,000 Singaporeans benefited from CHAS subsidies at these clinics. Under CHAS, our Regional Health Systems are working with the private sector to set up Family Medicine Clinics, which focus on chronic disease management.\nOur GP partners have also stepped up their effort in times of need. More than 600 clinics supported the rollout of the Haze Subsidy Scheme when Singapore was faced with severe haze in 2013 and 2015.\nFor hospital care, MOH has worked with the private sector to provide subsidised care to our patients. One example is the Emergency Care Collaboration with Raffles Hospital since 2015. Patients can be sent to Raffles Hospital for emergency care, followed by inpatient or specialist outpatient care if required. Charges for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are similar to what they would pay at our public hospitals. Another example is the collaboration with Parkway Hospitals to receive dengue patients from Changi General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).\nFor intermediate residential care, our acute hospitals have been in close collaboration with our Community Hospitals run by voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) on several fronts. One example is the collaboration between TTSH and Ren Ci Community Hospital (RCCH) to jointly develop clinical governance standards, care pathways, manpower capacity and capability to facilitate the transfer of patients between the institutions.\nFor long-term care, MOH has been working with the private sector to increase capacity to meet the needs of our ageing population. We have a portable subsidy scheme with up to 75% subsidy at participating private nursing homes. We work with private and VWO operators to operate aged care facilities, such as nursing homes and eldercare centres. We are also partnering VWO operators to enhance palliative care services. For example, we are providing funding support for the development of the new Assisi Hospice, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. And as part of this development, we are working with Assisi Hospice to expand its capacity for its inpatient, home and day hospice services so that more end-of-life patients can benefit.\nAs part of our healthcare transformation plans, MOH will continue to explore opportunities to work together with the private sector to provide quality subsidised care for Singaporeans.\nMdm Speaker\n: Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef.\nAssoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)\n:\nI thank the Minister for the response. Can I just find out pertaining to the Raffles Hospital and public hospital collaborations so far, what has been the feedback from patients as well as their caregivers, and whether there is a discussion or review to extend the programme beyond office hours as well as to other emergency departments also?\nMr Chee Hong Tat\n: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for her question. The collaboration with Raffles Hospital started since 2015. And during the first few months of the collaboration, there were some teething issues, including how to work with the SCDF paramedics so that they know how and where to send the patients to. But since then, the arrangement has worked out well. We have got good feedback from patients on their experiences at Raffles Hospital. This is feedback that we collected through surveys.\nThe arrangements with Raffles Hospital can also give us some good learning points that we can extend to other partnerships between public and private hospitals. And I think we can look at some of the suggestions that the Member has brought up, with the intent of seeing how we can work in collaboration with the private sector to provide good quality subsidised care for Singaporeans.\n3.00 pm\nMdm Speaker\n: Order.

    "content": "[(proc text) Order for Second Reading read. (proc text)]\n3.00 pm\nThe Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance)\n:\nMdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\nThe Income Tax (Amendment No 2) Bill 2016 covers two sets of amendments. The first set of amendments allows Singapore to implement the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), an internationally agreed standard for automatic exchange of financial account information. The second set of amendments gives effect to the changes announced in the 2016 Budget Statement to the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme.\nThe draft Bill on the first set of amendments was released for public consultation from 1 to 18 March 2016. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has evaluated all the feedback received and, where relevant, accepted the suggestions.\nMadam, let me explain each of the two sets of amendments in turn. The first, in relation to the implementation of the CRS.\nSingapore is firmly committed to upholding internationally accepted standards for the exchange of information under the CRS. Members might recall that in 2014, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax purposes, of which Singapore is a member, and the Group of 20 (G20) major economies, endorsed automatic exchange of information (AEOI) under the CRS as a global standard, and asked all members to commit to a timeline of 2018 or earlier for implementation. The CRS sets out the financial account information to be exchanged, the financial institutions (FIs) required to report, the different types of accounts and taxpayers covered as well as the customer due diligence procedures to be followed by FIs.\nSingapore had announced in November 2014 that we would implement the CRS to commence AEOI by 2018. To date, more than 90 jurisdictions, including major financial centres, such as Dubai, Hong Kong, Luxembourg and Switzerland, have also endorsed the CRS and committed to implementation timelines of 2017 or 2018. The proposed amendments in this Bill will enable FIs to put in place necessary processes and systems to collect CRS information from 1 January 2017, in order to meet our timeline to commence first exchange of information under the CRS in 2018.\nClauses 4 and 5 of the Bill make amendments in relation to existing provisions in the Income Tax Act, which had previously been introduced in 2013 to implement the Singapore-United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Inter-governmental Agreement (FATCA IGA). The provisions introduced in 2013 provide the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) the necessary information-gathering powers to fulfil Singapore's role in facilitating FATCA-compliance under the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA). These powers include the routine collection and transmission of relevant information as well as enforcement powers to sanction non-compliance. The amendments in this Bill make clear that these existing provisions are also applicable to any other AEOI agreement that is in accordance with the CRS. This will enable Singapore to sign Competent Authority Agreements (CAAs) with other jurisdictions to implement AEOI under the CRS.\nSecond, the amendments in clause 8 empower FIs to collect and retain the CRS information for all non-Singapore tax residents, instead of only from tax residents of jurisdictions with which Singapore has an AEOI agreement. This is known as the \"Wider Approach\". The Wider Approach is an effective approach preferred by our FIs because it removes the need for them to repeatedly review whether the accounts are reportable each time Singapore enters into a new Competent Authority Agreement. The Wider Approach has been adopted by many jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom (UK), Sweden, Japan and Korea.\nMdm Speaker, I wish to make it clear that while FIs are empowered to collect and retain the CRS information for all non-Singapore tax residents from 1 January 2017, they will only need to transmit to IRAS the information relating to tax residents of jurisdictions with which Singapore has signed a Competent Authority Agreement, for IRAS to implement AEOI under the CRS accordingly. Clause 9 of the Bill provides for this.\nThe amendments also ensure effective implementation of the CRS, including vesting in IRAS the necessary administrative powers to do so. The changes include mandating the electronic filing of returns and information and are provided for in clauses 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill.\nNext, Madam, I will deal with the changes to the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme. These were announced in the 2016 Budget Statement. The key changes are as follows.\nFirst, as we move towards more targeted measures under the Industry Transformation Programme as announced during the recent Budget, the PIC cash payout rate will be lowered from 60% to 40% for qualifying expenditure incurred on or after 1 August 2016.\nSecond, to streamline and expedite processing of PIC cash payout applications, electronic filing of PIC cash payout applications will be made mandatory from 1 August 2016. The PIC changes are provided for in clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.\n[(proc text) Question proposed.  (proc text)]\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Louis Ng.\n3.07 pm\nMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)\n: Madam, I stand in support of the Bill. I will focus my speech on the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) Scheme.\nThe PIC scheme was introduced to encourage productivity and innovation activities in Singapore. It provides support to businesses that make investments to improve their productivity. There is no doubt that the PIC scheme has been a success. As stated by Senior Minister of State Indranee Rajah in March, since its inception until January this year, 102,000 companies, or 70%, of all active companies in IRAS' records for the Year of Assessment 2014 have benefited in one way or another from the PIC scheme. This is a pretty impressive statistic.\nHowever, as with any scheme, there are bound to be loopholes and people are bound to try and exploit and abuse the scheme.\nAs previously mentioned also by Senior Minister of State Indranee Rajah, IRAS does conduct rigorous compliance programmes to review and audit PIC claims. However, only 30% of claims from years of assessment 2011 to 2015 have been investigated or audited and about 2.1% of these claims investigated required clawback. For years of assessment 2011 to 2014, IRAS has clawed back $11 million.\nWhile the percentage requiring clawback seems low, it does represent a significant number of people trying to cheat the system or submitting inaccurate claims, perhaps unintentionally, and $11 million does seem like a sizable amount of money. Quite clearly, if we investigate and audit the remaining 70% of claims, we will uncover even more cases and have to claw back even more funds.\nBut what alarms me more are the other figures published in a The Straits Times' article, and I quote, \"IRAS has rejected or clawed back the sums paid out to about one in three cash payout claims filed by the self-employed as the claims were inaccurate or false. The sums not given out or recovered from these dubious claims amounted to about $358 million in the last five years.\"\nThis means that IRAS is either spending a lot of resources weeding out inaccurate or false claims or spending a lot of resources trying to claw back funds already paid out. Either way, this $358 million figure points to a real need to strengthen the system.\nWhile we are phasing out the PIC scheme, I understand that, on the ground, PIC consultants are going all out, doing whatever it is possible to source for clients and make as many claims as possible and whilst stocks last. Quite understandably, they are doing this.\nThis makes it even more important for us to strengthen the system and strengthen it in the right way. The fact is that many people are still trying their luck. We need to strengthen the system so that fewer people want to even try their luck. We need to strengthen the approval process and make sure people know that it is being strengthened.\nWe need to urgently investigate and audit more claims. We need to send a deterrent message to companies that if they try to cheat the system, they will get caught and the penalties are severe.\nWe need to increase the odds significantly and the current odds are in favour of the cheaters as there is only about a one in three chance of their claim being audited.\nWill the Ministry also consider cutting down on providing grants to low productivity yield projects like websites or app designs? And will the Ministry consider giving out the grants in disbursements for innovation projects that need to show payoff, in terms of productivity gains and projection of sales? All of which requires information filing one year from implementation. Ultimately, we need to safeguard taxpayers' money.\nWe also need to take a stronger stand when it comes to PIC consultants. A PIC consultant is a person or a business entity that provides advice or assistance to businesses on PIC matters for a fee. A PIC consultant is expected to be knowledgeable about the PIC scheme and be familiar with the correct procedures when submitting PIC cash payout claims for his clients. I am sure we have all seen their claims and guarantees of cashing in on the PIC scheme and I have met numerous residents telling me stories of how they have been approached by the consultants. We need to make changes to ensure that consultants are no longer able to cheat the Government and also the companies.\nThe amendment in the Bill requiring the use of the electronic service is a step forward. It will help end the abuse of the system where companies sign blank PIC forms and pass them to the consultants. As we now streamline the application process, I question the need for PIC consultants to submit the application forms on behalf of their clients or applicants. Can the Ministry clarify why we continue to allow this and whether there are plans to phase this out?\nI appreciate that some companies need help for PIC matters. But can IRAS not handle these enquiries directly? IRAS already states on its website that companies can contact them for assistance or clarification on PIC matters. There are even separate phone numbers for companies and the self-employed. And if the enquiry contains confidential information, they can email IRAS via myTax Mail for added security. With all these in place, is there a need for consultants to help provide advice and submit applications? I ask that this be reviewed also because I have met residents at my Meet-the-People Sessions who have been cheated by the consultants.\nMadam, the PIC scheme has benefited many and as I had shared during the Committee of Supply debates, I am concerned that we are ending it. However, I am more concerned that as we get closer and closer to the end date, more and more people will try to cash in. This Bill does help to strengthen the system. But I sincerely believe that we need to do more.\nMdm Speaker, my request for the Government to review the above notwithstanding, I support the Bill.\n3.12 pm\nMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast)\n: Mdm Speaker, I wish to declare my interest as the Chief Executive Officer of the Wealth Management Institute. According to Oxfam International, lost tax revenue from money salted away offshore costs governments more than $150 billion a year. This is estimated to be enough to eliminate extreme poverty across the globe twice over. I commend the Singapore Government for its strong efforts in the anti-money laundering regime and its active cooperation with other jurisdictions through the exchange of information for tax purposes to facilitate tax compliance.\nInternational clients should choose to bank in Singapore on the strengths of our broad and deep capabilities in financial products and services, strong regulatory regime and rule of law, and not because they think they can abuse our laws to evade paying tax.\nI support the proposed amendments to the Income Tax (Amendment No 2) Bill to allow Singapore to implement the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) with effect from 1 January 2017, a move that improves our international tax compliance. This is in line with Singapore's commitment to commence automatic exchange of financial account information (AEOI) in 2018.\nMadam, whilst this remains the goal that Singapore must pursue, we should be under no illusions about the complexity of CRS implementation. The way forward will be difficult and will require us to navigate obstacles with great skill, cleverness and caution. I would like to highlight four areas of concern.\nFirst, we should be mindful of the impact of CRS on Singapore's competitiveness as an international financial centre. Many industry participants are concerned that an overly enthusiastic response at this early implementation stage, imposing more than the required obligations on Financial Institutions (FIs) may hurt the competitiveness and growth of our wealth management industry. It is important to observe the pace adopted by other jurisdictions and consider a measured approach at a prudent pace. Not all countries have signed up, and those which have signed may implement Competent Authority Agreements (CAAs) at a different pace. Could the Minister share the impact on Singapore's competitiveness if other financial centres adopt a different approach? How can we ensure a level playing field among all major financial centres, including Dubai, Hong Kong, Luxembourg and Switzerland, to minimise regulatory arbitrage?\nSecond, the implementation of CRS and AEOI will add significant compliance costs to FIs. To avoid FIs being overwhelmed by the administrative burden of CRS implementation and the complexity of system enhancements, they will need clear guidance to enable a consistent interpretation of requirements. The industry expects the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to issue guidance notes that set a reasonable industry standard that strives to balance responsible global compliance with reasonable expectations of responses from FIs. Burdensome complexity brings with it the risk of non-compliance and its accompanying cost of penalties.\nMadam, the guidance must be sufficiently meaningful so as to enable FIs to determine tax residency consistently across banks. For example, it is common for FI clients to maintain multiple residences or they may travel so frequently that they have no tax residency status. Another example is how will information that Singapore receives on offshore income of Singapore resident taxpayers be used, collected and shared? Different FIs may hold differing reading of the same individual's tax status. So, I would like to ask the Minister how we could take a more nuanced approach that would provide greater clarity for industry players to deal with issues of tax residency.\nFIs should be expected to do the necessary due diligence to establish the clients' tax residency. But, to a large extent, FIs will have to rely on their clients' declarations or what their clients declare to them. Is that good enough, or will the FIs be expected to corroborate those declarations, and how far are they expected to go to do so? To what extent will FIs be culpable for inaccurate declarations?\nThird, we must ensure that a robust process is in place to determine the readiness of bilateral partners of CAAs before bilateral information exchanges commence. Not every country is as ready as we are to deal with transparency, and we have a duty to the clients we serve to safeguard their privacy against abuse.\nTax information can be misused for a variety of nefarious ends, including criminal enterprise, political corruption and social chaos. We have heard of cases where tax information is misused to achieve political objectives or leaked to criminals.\nI would like to ask the Minister to provide assurance that our authorities are, indeed, in a strong position to determine that our CRS partners have strong rule of law, the ability to ensure the confidentiality of information exchanged and prevent its unauthorised use before signing CAAs for information exchanges. Also, how do we ensure there is full reciprocity with AEOI partners in terms of information exchanged?\nEven if we do all this well, it is still important for us to communicate skillfully and clearly to international clients who bank in Singapore how rigorously we will safeguard their interests, so that they are assured that their information will not fall into the wrong hands. To this end, I would like to ask the Minister to lay out clearly how Singapore will prioritise the countries that we sign CAAs with, together with estimated timelines. One input that the Government may consider referencing is published corruption indices by independent international organisations, such as Transparency International, which will be well-known to all stakeholders.\nLast but not least, Madam, with the advent of information exchanges for tax compliance, we need clarity on an individual's right to privacy protection under our laws. In my speech in 2013, I spoke on the amendment that gives IRAS the right to access information protected under the Banking Act and the Trust Companies Act for Exchange of Information, without having to first obtain a Court Order.\nMadam, at the time, I voiced concerns that this amendment may undermine the confidence that clients and investors have in Singapore's banking privacy laws. I was assured by the then Senior Minister of State  Josephine Teo that robust safeguards have been put in place by IRAS, including the need for foreign jurisdictions to explain why the request is being made, identify the taxpayer under investigation or assessment, and declare that it has pursued all available means in its own jurisdiction to obtain the information.\nYet, in less than three years, we are asked to consider a regime that automates the exchange of sensitive information. How will FI clients regard the rigour with which we safeguard the integrity of their tax information and the individual's right to privacy?\nMdm Speaker, in conclusion, I support Singapore's role in the vanguard of international cooperation to facilitate tax compliance. However, we need to guard against regulatory arbitrage, implementation complexity and systemic leakage and misuse of information exchange. FI clients must ready themselves for a new age of unprecedented transparency and big changes to tax regimes, as governments work hard to get what is due their peoples. In this, wealth managers can be the authorities' greatest allies in educating and advising their clients, to bring them on board, and we should work together towards a common cause.\nMdm Speaker\n: Senior Minister of State.\n3.22 pm\nMs Indranee Rajah\n: Madam, I wish to thank the Members, Mr Louis Ng and Ms Foo Mee Har, for their support for the Bill.\nMs Foo Mee Har raised three points: the protection of taxpayers' confidentiality and considerations for the Singapore Government when determining AEOI partners; second, ensuring a level playing field with competitor jurisdictions, such as Switzerland and Hong Kong; and third, whether there will be more detailed guidance provided to the FIs.\nAs AEOI entails the transmission of information between jurisdictions, Singapore will consider entering into bilateral AEOI arrangements only with appropriate partners, subject to three conditions.\nFirst, and as pointed out by Ms Foo Mee Har, there must be a level playing field amongst all major financial centres, including Hong Kong and Switzerland, to minimise regulatory arbitrage. These financial centres have endorsed AEOI under the common reporting standard and are committed to implementation timelines of 2017 or 2018.\nSecond, and as also highlighted by Ms Foo, it is critical that we protect taxpayers' confidentiality. This is why we will engage in AEOI only with jurisdictions that have strong rule of law and the ability to ensure the confidentiality of information exchanged and prevent its unauthorised use.  CRS includes specific rules on confidentiality and data safeguards that must be in place before information is exchanged.\nThe Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes has also set up an expert panel to review jurisdictions' implementation of these safeguards to ensure that AEOI takes place in a secure environment. Singapore will take into consideration the outcome of such reviews when we consider which jurisdictions to engage in AEOI with.\nThird, there must be full reciprocity with AEOI partners in terms of information exchanged. These conditions are necessary to make sure that we continue to respect the legitimate expectations for confidentiality even as we implement AEOI to contribute to the global effort to tackle offshore tax evasion. In this regard, Singapore will prioritise AEOI with jurisdictions which meet the conditions stated, such as the UK and France.\nWe are mindful that implementing AEOI under the CRS will impose new obligations on our FIs. FIs will need to institute new procedures and configure their systems to fulfil their customer due diligence and reporting obligations under the CRS.\nThe Government is working closely with the financial industry in our implementation of the CRS. MOF, IRAS and MAS held a public consultation on proposed legislative amendments in March and will be releasing draft regulations for consultation by June this year. This will allow FIs to have sufficient time to make changes to their procedures and systems to comply with the CRS requirements. The regulations will detail the CRS requirements that FIs have to comply with.\nMoving on to Mr Louis Ng's speech on the PIC, we agree with Mr Ng on the need to ensure that PIC claims are genuine and in order. IRAS has taken and will continue to take a strong stance against abuse of the PIC scheme, whether consultants are involved or not.\nIRAS does not make it mandatory for taxpayers to submit PIC claims through consultants, and many businesses submitted the applications on their own without the help of consultants. At the end of the day, it is the company's choice as to whether to use consultants or not. But from our perspective, we would require that any information that they submit for their claims must be true and accurate.\nMr Ng noted that IRAS had investigated or audited about 71,000 claims or around 30% of the PIC cash payout claims made from years of assessment 2011 to 2015. He suggested that IRAS audit and investigate more PIC claims. IRAS takes a risk-based approach in its enforcement, and this 30% is not a fixed rule. The 71,000 claims were identified for investigation or audit based on the use of analytics and risk profiling, as well as the experience of the IRAS investigators. Of these 71,000 claims, about 44,000 claims, or 62%, were rejected upfront even before any cash was disbursed. Hence, there was no need for a clawback. About 5,500 claims are undergoing audit or investigation. Of the 21,500 claims for which investigations have been completed, 20,000 were in order and 1,500 required clawback.\nI would like to assure Mr Ng that even as the PIC scheme lapses from the year of assessment 2018, IRAS will continue to conduct rigorous compliance programmes to review and audit the PIC claims. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.\n[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]\n[(proc text) Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

    "content": "[(proc text) Order for Second Reading read. (proc text)]\n3.30 pm\nThe Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin)\n:\nMdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".\nSingapore is our home for family. Strong families are, and must remain, the basic building blocks of our society. For each of our families and our society, children are our future. With strong families and good support from society, our children can have a good start in life. In the coming years, my Ministry will continue to strengthen fundamental family relationships and support vulnerable families.\nFathers play an important role in parenting, and shared parental responsibility should become a way of life in our society. During last year's National Day Rally (NDR), our Prime Minister said that eligible fathers may be granted an extra week of paid paternity leave, with their employers' approval. Employers who agree to grant this extra week of leave to employees may seek reimbursement from the Government. This is on top of the one week of paternity leave we have today, which is compulsory and which the Government pays for.\nTo celebrate the Jubilee year, we had extended the extra week of paid leave to all fathers of Singaporean babies born on or after 1 January 2015. This additional week should allow fathers to be more active in raising their children. The Public Service took the lead by implementing this immediately.\nSince the NDR announcement on 23 August 2015, enlightened employers have been granting their employees the extra week of paternity leave. This Bill allows employers to seek reimbursement for the leave taken by eligible employees. Eligible self-employed persons can likewise claim the loss of income from the Government for the additional week of leave taken. The reimbursement can take place from 1 July 2016, when the system is ready. Employers will still be reimbursed for leave taken from 24 August 2015 to 30 June 2016.\nMembers will also remember Senior Minister of State Josephine Teo announcing at the National Population and Talent Division's (NPTD) Committee of Supply (COS) last month that this second week of paternity leave will be mandated from 1 January 2017. This will be done in the next round of amendments to the Child Development Co-savings Act (CDCA), together with the enhancements to the other leave schemes announced at NPTD's COS.\nSeparately, as announced at my Ministry's COS last month, we will extend the Child Development Account (CDA) benefits to Singaporean children of unwed parents. This includes the $3,000 CDA First Step grant. Children of unwed parents may be disadvantaged and require more support. The Child Development Co-Savings Scheme encourages unwed parents to contribute to the child's CDA for his or her development needs, and the amount will be matched by the Government up to a cap. As CDA funds can only be used for approved educational and healthcare-related uses for the child, this can help to enhance the child's outcomes. We are doing up the system enhancement concurrently for this to kick in, likely for children born from the third quarter of this year.\nUnwed mothers will also qualify for the full 16 weeks of maternity leave for children born from early next year. The longer paid leave will provide unwed mothers with more time to care for their child in the early months. This provision will be included in the next round of CDCA amendments.\nThe Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the National Council of Social Services (NCSS) will also work with the relevant VWOs and agencies to strengthen support for families with vulnerable, low-income unwed mothers. This is to enable them to make better-informed decisions to improve their financial and family stability and, ultimately, enhance their child's outcomes.\nIn conclusion, these legislative amendments are needed to carry out the enhancements that had been announced earlier at NDR 2015 as well as COS 2016. I do seek Parliament's agreement for the amendments, so that we can support families where it matters most. With that, Madam, I beg to move.\n[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]\nMdm Speaker\n: Assoc Prof Daniel Goh.\n3.35 pm\nAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member)\n: Mdm Speaker, the birth rate in Singapore seems to be recovering from record lows. In 2010, we hit our lowest number of citizen births at just over 30,000 babies born. In 2012, in the Chinese zodiac Year of the Dragon, citizen births increased to over 33,000 babies. The good news is that citizen births in the last two years have matched the auspicious Year of the Dragon. In fact, last year, citizen births almost hit 34,000 babies, the highest in a decade. The total fertility rate (TFR) is hovering around 1.25, off the low of 1.16 in 2010.\nThere is some hope that we have turned the corner with regard to falling birth rates. However, it is still too early to tell whether the increased birth rate is a trend or a temporary rise due to positive sentiments brought about by the SG50 Jubilee celebrations. I think we can be cautiously optimistic. I will touch on the optimistic part first.\nI am optimistic because I believe the Government has been addressing the structural obstacles to higher birth rates. In 2013, the Workers' Party (WP), in response to the Government's Population White Paper, published its own population policy paper after the White Paper debate in this House. In WP's paper, we elaborated on seven obstacles that stood in the way of higher birth rates.\nOne, lack of work-life balance; two, escalating housing costs; three, income inequality; four, stressful education system; five, gender inequality in the family with regard to housework and childcare; six, pro-birth policies favouring higher income families; and seven, discrimination towards single-parent families.\nThe Government has been addressing some of these issues in the last few years. With this Bill, the Government is further enhancing paternity leave and is also addressing the last two structural obstacles that we have brought up: discrimination towards single-parent families and pro-birth policies favouring higher-income families.\nWe have been arguing that, while having children inside of marriage should continue to be encouraged, the children born to unwed parents should not be denied the benefits that children of married parents received. We believe no children deserve to be disadvantaged and psychologically damaged for the norms their parents break.\nClause 2(b) of this Bill expands the eligibility of the CDA co-savings scheme to \"any other child\", without amending the purpose of the Act, which is to, \"encourage married women to have more children\". This amendment achieves the dual goals of encouraging births within marriage without discriminating against the children of unwed parents that we have called for.\nWe have also argued that the CDA scheme privileges higher-income families with the spare cash to put away into CDA. Middle-income families just managing to make ends meet to support three children would need to lock up $24,000 in CDA to reap the full benefits of dollar-for-dollar matching from the Government. Furthermore, as the quantum increases from $6,000 for each of the first two children, to $12,000 each for the third and fourth child, and $18,000 each for the fifth child and beyond, this actually encourages higher-income couples who could make the larger savings to have more children.\nThe new CDA First Step grant of $3,000 addresses this issue of inequality. It does so by establishing baseline savings for all children, regardless of the household income background. It is a good first step by the Government in addressing the inequalities facing families seeking to have children. Because equality matters.\nWhile there are reasons to be optimistic because of the Government's policy reversals and advancement, we should be very cautious in our optimism. We have the benefit of hindsight in the struggle against low birth rates for nearly 30 years now. Singapore's TFR fell below the replacement level of 2.1 in 1976 and reached the first low of 1.4 in 1986. In 1987, the Government's policy reversal from promoting birth control to encouraging Singaporeans to have more children, helped push the birth rate up in the following years. Many of the young couples having children today were born during the mini-baby boom caused by the policy reversal.\nHowever, the TFR resumed its gradual decline in the 1990s to hit the low of 1.4 in 2001 again. In reaction to the plunging TFR, the Government then launched the Baby Bonus scheme, which slowed the decline. But the decline continued through the 2000s till TFR reached the lowest in 2010.\nSo, what are the lessons here? First, the Government's pro-birth policy is important and can be effective in halting or slowing down birth rate declines. However, most of the pro-birth policy changes have been reactive rather than proactive with the 1987 reversal reacting to the low in 1986, the Baby Bonus scheme reacting to the low in 2001, and the enhancements in the last few years reacting to the lowest in 2010. This reactiveness limits the effectiveness of pro-birth policies.\nInstead of reacting to plunges and new lows in birth rates, I believe the Government should set a target of achieving a TFR of 1.4 in 2020 and a TFR of 1.7 by 2030. This will change the tone of the issue from being marked as a demographic problem to be struggled with to a performance target to be achieved, on par with many of the Government's socio-economic policies. After all, the TFR is as much a socioeconomic issue as it is a demographic one.\nThe other lesson to be had here is that policies need to go beyond the carrot-and-stick approach and take a whole-of-Government approach to be effective over the long run. In this respect, there is one dot that the Government has not connected to the birth rate issue, and it should. One reason why pro-birth policies seem to be swimming against the tide in the 1990s and 2000s was because Singaporeans experienced growing socio-economic inequality and lingering gender inequality in those two decades. Equality matters for increasing birth rates. This has been shown in many studies in other developed countries. On this issue, I would like to make three points.\nFirst, gender equality matters a whole lot. As more fathers take on more responsibility in childcare, pro-birth policies, such as those promoting flexi-work arrangements should adapt to help fathers realise their parenting aspirations. As employer and management mind-sets start to change due to the Government's promotion of flexi-work arrangements through the Work-Life Grant, it would be important to help mould the new mind-sets to emphasise that flexi-work arrangements are not meant only or mainly for working mothers but should be made as accessible to working fathers too.\nIn this respect, the Government will need to change its own mindset that establishes a hard association between mothers and childcare. The Additional Child Care Subsidy for working mothers should be made gender-neutral and extended to working fathers, so that lower-income female homemakers with several children or elderly dependants are not denied the subsidy and could provide better care to the dependants.\nThe Government should also consider rewording section 3, subsection 1(a) of the Act which I quoted earlier, to, \"encourage married couples to have more children\", instead of \"married women\". This is so as to emphasise in our laws that the state does not place the burden of birth rates and thus the blame of low births solely on the motivations of women but recognise that the decision to have children and the raising of children are the shared responsibility of both spouses. The wording of the CDCA should be thoroughly looked at to emphasise this shared responsibility to have and raise more children.\nAlso, since the Act has expanded beyond the original monetary co-savings carrot, the Government should also consider renaming the Act to reflect the contents more accurately and better, symbolically, perhaps as the Family Life Promotion Act.\nSecond, we should extend the equality of benefits to all men and women who are parents of Singaporean children as far as possible. This includes single unwed parents and also the non-citizen spouses of Singaporeans. This may not seem related to the birth rates of married citizen couples at first glance. But we are all social beings living in communities of shared interests in the first instance, not detached individuals with selfish interests. As we have seen in this House, Members from across the political spectrum have strongly empathised with single unwed mothers. There is something universal in this sentiment, as those of us who have or aspire to have children cannot bear to see other children suffer through no fault of their own. Extending equality to all parents of Singaporean children cultivates positive sentiments for having babies and raising children.\nExtending eligibility for the CDA co-savings grant to the children of single unwed parents is a good first step. The next step is to consider extending the Baby Bonus Cash Gift to the same children, but perhaps to be deposited into the CDA so that the grant may be locked up for the sole benefit of the children.\nIt is also a good time to look at the housing needs of children of single unwed parents. As it is, this group of single parents is prevented from buying a new or resale Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat until they are 35 years old to go under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme. This creates an unacceptable inequality where Permanent Residents benefit more from HDB home ownership than a group of citizens. More importantly, the children are denied a stable physical and social environment to grow up in to focus on their schooling and playing.\nThe empathy for suffering Singaporean children and their parents also extends to non-citizen spouses who struggle with residential security due to the need to constantly renew visit passes. The Government should alleviate the stress and separation anxieties faced by the Singaporean spouses and children in such situations. I reiterate WP's call for foreign spouses of Singapore Citizens to be given priority for citizenship naturalisation after five years on the Long-Term Visit Pass Plus.\nThird, socioeconomic inequality matters. Therefore, socioeconomic equality matters. Singaporeans are economically rational and both short-term and long-term financial security affect their decisions to have more babies. The CDA First Step grant is a welcome move towards narrowing the gap in child development resources between low-income and high-income households. The Government should bring this policy move to its logical conclusion by automatically allocating to the CDA a standardised $10,000 for each child. It is then up to the parents to match the grant by topping up the CDA up to another $10,000 to earn higher interest and earmark savings for the child's education and well-being. The Government could create incentives for parents to make the additional savings by making the savings eligible for income tax reliefs.\nThe reason we are calling for a standardised grant for each child instead of the stepwise $6,000, $12,000 and $18,000 formula for the CDA grants is because short-term financial security is a factor, especially for lower-income and middle-income households. The stepwise formula is meant to be carrots to entice parents to have three babies or more but ignores the fact that the immediate stress and cost of raising existing children would put off parents from deciding on the third baby. Giving a bigger grant for the existing children would alleviate the immediate stress, encourage a healthy family life and persuade parents that it is worth the while to have a third child and more.\nEqualising the grants would also remove an artificial inequality within the family created by the policy. With the current policy, the third and fourth child could receive up to $12,000 more savings and grants, compared to the first and second child, and the fifth child onwards could receive up to $24,000 more. This means that the older children would have less funds benefiting their education and well-being, compared to the younger children.\nMdm Speaker, I am cautiously optimistic that we are at the crossroads of turning around our declining birth rates. I am cautiously optimistic that the Government has finally found the verve after three decades to stop blaming Singaporeans for not choosing to have babies and to start addressing the structural obstacles to enable Singaporeans to have more babies. As the lessons of three decades show, the Government cannot be reactive towards lower birth rates and should be proactive to aim for higher birth rates. And as the Government seeks to enable and empower Singaporeans to have more babies, please remember these two words as a key principle to guide pro-birth policy: equality matters. On this note, I support the Bill.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Louis Ng.\n3.46 pm\nMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)\n:  Madam, I stand in full support of this Bill, a Bill which starts a new chapter in our journey in parenthood and a Bill which brings about a fundamental change in our parenthood policies, a much-needed fundamental change.\nI also stand in full support of this Bill because it is not only about  dollars and cents but also about the hours, the minutes and the seconds, the precious time we spend with our children.\nThe amendments to section 3 bring about a stronger sense of inclusiveness. Single unwed mothers do not enjoy most of the benefits and support given to married mothers. You do not have to be a single parent to realise the difficulties they go through and  face in bringing up their children.\nNo matter what the circumstances are that led to them being single unwed mothers, we should still help and support them, especially their child or children who, like us, are fellow Singaporeans.\nAs I mentioned during the Committee of Supply (COS) debates, to be a truly inclusive society, we need to accord equal rights to our single unwed mothers, and we should ensure that they do not feel alone in their journey. We must help and support them rather than penalise them. This is the right thing to do.\nSo, I am extremely delighted that the proposed amendment to section 3 seeks to expand the categories of children who may be eligible under the Child Development Co-Savings Scheme. Children, other than children of married mothers, will now qualify for the scheme. Together with MSF, we have fought hard for this. I have joined 16 other Members of Parliament (MPs), Non-Constituency MPs (NCMPs) and Nominated MPs (NMPs) and the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) who, over the 12 years, spoke up for this.\nThe change in this policy is timely and I do hope that this does open the floodgates of help and support for single unwed mothers and the days of penalising them are history and they will finally get the same high level of support we give to our married mothers.\nBut this Bill does not just talk about mothers. It also emphasises the important role fathers play. Research at the University of Bergen has shown that, and I quote, \"A sensitive and attentive father has a positive influence on a child's development, but only if he spends a considerable amount of time with his child during his first year\". This research is part of a major project at The Norwegian Centre for Child Behavioural Development.\nAnd the researcher's advice was simple, and I quote again, \"Try to get leave from work in order to spend as much time as possible with your child during his first year. But, above all, make sure you spend high quality time with your child.\"\nThe amendments in this Bill seek to provide this by allowing employers to claim reimbursement from the Government for the extra week of paternity leave. Subsequent amendments to this Act, as the Minister has mentioned, where the second week of paternity leave will be legislated, will further strengthen this.\nBut I urge the Government to do more, to not just do more in providing financial grants, which is important, but also do more in helping to ensure that both fathers and mothers have the chance to spend more time with their children. The Government is now writing this next and brand-new chapter in this journey, and we now need employers and fathers to join us.\nMinister Tan had previously stated that in 2013, only 28% of fathers took up the Government-paid Paternity Leave; in 2014, the figure was 36%. These figures are clearly not encouraging. I sincerely hope that employers will not only grant the fathers their paternity leave but also actively encourage them to take it. My appeal for fathers, speaking up as a father, is that you will not regret spending time, quality time, with your children in this amazing journey called parenthood. This is a journey that changes your life, that makes you a better person, and this is a journey your children need you to play an active role in.\nThis journey has changed my life. I have gone from being the biggest Linkin Park fan to now being the biggest Pororo Park fan. And quite embarrassingly, I can sing most of the songs you hear at Pororo Park in Marina Square. And I know that life has changed when I now subconsciously start singing Pororo songs.\nLife has also changed for me from having tea parties with the Prime Minister and the Ministers to now having weekly tea parties with my daughter. The tea parties are much less stressful now, but those imaginary cups of tea have made it much easier for me to understand my daughter.\nLastly, life has certainly changed for me now as I am no longer the most stubborn person in my house. My daughter has learnt to say the word \"no\" and I never knew that someone could say the word \"no\" so many times in a day. I hope that she does not change and every guy that approaches her in the future, she will say \"no\".\nMadam, I am often asked in the media what special powers I wish I have, and my reply has always been that I wished I had the power to turn back time. As much as I try to live a life without regrets, there will always be regrets, always a wish that we could have done things better, and always a wish that we could have spent more time with our loved ones. And as recently published in a The Straits Times article, \"Regret is an incurable ache\".\nThe time spent with our children is precious and should be cherished. The memories created will last forever and are priceless. Madam, we cannot buy time, and we cannot turn back time. We cannot get back the hours, the minutes and the seconds lost. But we can, every day, treasure and value the time we have with our children and our loved ones.\nMadam, this Bill is an important step forward for unwed mothers, for all fathers, mothers, children and employers. This is a journey we must all take together and the only regret one will have is that they did not participate in this journey.\nLet me end with a less known quote about parenthood by Jill Smokler, and it reads: \"Being a parent is dirty and scary and beautiful and hard and miraculous and exhausting and thankless and joyful and frustrating all at once. It is everything.\" Madam, I wholeheartedly support this Bill.\nMdm Speaker\n: Minister Tan Chuan-Jin.\n3.53 pm\nMr Tan Chuan-Jin\n: Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Louis Ng and Assoc Prof Daniel Goh for supporting this Bill. I would like to quickly address the point on TFR. We have all been concerned about our birth rates for quite some time.\nThere are many different reasons behind this. We are not the only country that is affected by it. I would like to assure the Members of this House that we are fully committed to exploring all possible ways. Many of the suggestions come from both sides of the House and many members of the public out there. And many ideas, many different suggestions; some initiatives are carried out in other countries; some have worked better; some have not worked as well. Sometimes, it is also contextual and depending on the cultural context. Broadly, we do want to look at not just carrots and sticks, but really the overall environment is important. Ultimately, the last and final step must be taken by individuals and their families. What we can do is to provide as supportive an environment as possible.\nAs whether we are reactive or not, I am also hopeful. The rates have marginally increased. We hope that they can be sustained. The approach that we have taken really is not about being reactive. I think the reactive part happened quite some time ago and we saw the trends turning into the direction which we were not quite happy with. And it is a series of measures. Each time, as we see the effect and if it did take effect, we continued to calibrate and improve. And this journey will continue.\nI would like to assure Assoc Prof Daniel Goh that our target is indeed to try to move up to 1.4 and 1.5. In fact, in the Deputy Prime Minister's opening remarks at the Parliamentary debate on the Population White Paper on 4 February 2013, he said, \"In the short term, I hope our birth rate can increase to at least 1.4 or 1.5\", which was our birth rate not so long ago, around the late-1990s and the early-2000s.\nThis is something that we intend to do. I do call on all Members in this House who still have some way to go in terms of contributing to the data, well, please. I would imagine Mr Louis Ng and Ms Tin Pei Ling would help us on that front as well. It is something that we all have a part to play. In terms of environment and culture, it is not something that is just mandated by the Government. It is something that is created by all of us as well. Societal attitudes really are a sum total of individual attitudes. We all have a part to play. So, let us all chip in.\nI am also very heartened to hear from both Mr Louis Ng and Assoc Prof Daniel Goh on their support of the extension of the Child Development Co-Saving Scheme to children of unwed parents. We know that this has been an issue that many have been championing for some time. It is something I personally felt very strongly about. I have noted that they would like the Government to extend to unwed mothers the same high level of support we give to married mothers on all fronts.\nBut before I address this point, let me reiterate the key principles underlying our decision for the review on support for unwed parents.\nFirstly, the benefits extended must directly contribute to the child's development or caregiving needs. So, that is one motivating reason. Secondly, the benefits must also support the unwed parent's efforts to provide for the child. Lastly, it is also important for us to remember that we do want to encourage families to have children within the confines of parenthood and within the confines of marriage. I think this is to the prevailing prevalent social norm and we all would agree that it is always best for children to grow up in that environment and that is something  we want to continue to encourage.\nI think we have said this several times, but I would like to repeat this here again that it is important to note that while there might be some differentiation for unwed parents, the children of these unwed parents do continue to be provided for on many fronts. It would be not correct to say that they are deprived of everything else. Yes, there are some differences. We have equalised some of it in my recent moves. But I want to emphasise that we do want to support the growth and development of all Singapore Citizen children, regardless of the marital status of their parents. For example, the benefits include education, healthcare subsidies, MediSave grant for newborns, centre-based infant and childcare subsidies and foreign domestic worker levy concession. All working parents, regardless of their marital status, are also eligible for infant care leave, childcare leave before the child turns seven, and extended childcare leave when the child is seven to 12 years old. And this has been the case for some time.\nWhile we do what we can for the children, we do think that we must continue to try and encourage and support parenthood within the confines of marriage. This is the prevailing social norm. Many of us would agree that it would always be ideal if children can grow up within the confines of that. But having said, we do recognise that situations do happen and we want to support the children and we do want to support the families.\nFor vulnerable, low-income unwed parents who need more assistance, my Ministry and the NCSS will work with relevant VWOs and agencies to strengthen support for them and their families. Previously, many of us here, as MPs, we will meet some of our residents who fall under difficult circumstances and unwed mums. And notwithstanding the fact that there were some differences in some of those various benefits, there is always wholehearted support in terms of providing for them when they do need that help.\nMembers will also remember that we are starting the KidSTART programme that I shared in Parliament last month. Through this programme, we will proactively identify low-income and vulnerable children aged six and below, and many of these would include children of unwed parents. That is a very substantive effort and I hope that this is something that would take off because I think it will have a significant impact over the long haul.\nMr Louis Ng has supported the amendment to allow employers and self-employed persons to claim reimbursement and loss of income, respectively, for the second week of paternity leave. In fact, he would like employers to actively encourage their employees to take it.\nI could not agree more. For the employers who have been doing so, you have the Government's support; we will fully fund this leave, as long as you grant it. More importantly, the support you give your staff to better manage their work-life responsibilities will enhance their loyalty and productivity as well. Employers who go the extra mile will also attract talent, especially in today's tight labour market. The Government will do its part by continuing to support parents through leave schemes and promoting a pro-family workplace. This includes encouraging employers to adopt family-friendly practices, such as providing flexible work arrangements.\nOn the point of active fatherhood, Mr Louis Ng shared passionately about his experiences, and many of us here who are parents would fully understand his sentiments. The amendments tabled today are in support of parenthood. He shared with us what Jill Smokler had to say about this journey. My challenge to fellow fathers is to find this out for ourselves. There are no shortcuts and we should spend time and effort to be good fathers.\nActive fatherhood is a personal commitment. I personally believe that it is not just about quality time, but it is also about quantity time. We must try to be present in our children's lives as much as possible. We can do all we can in terms of schemes, in terms of measures to support. But many of us will also know that we do have choices to make. Oftentimes, we cite reasons like work and so on. But sometimes, we are also distracted by our own preoccupations. The question is: are we prepared to put in the sacrifices? Are we prepared to put in the time? Instead of spending time with our friends watching football somewhere else, spending time with children and so on and so forth. And I think as we scroll down and actually study the kind of commitments that we are committed to and we find ourselves busy with, we will find that there are things there that we can actually choose to forgo in favour of time spent with family.\nMr Louis Ng hit the nail on the head when he shared that the time with our children is precious. Many of us whose children have grown up or continued to grow up, obviously, we do miss those days when they were toddlers and, each stage, as it moves on, does not ever come back and these will become memories for life, and it is important for us to be there to cherish it when those memories are created. So, it is important for us to be more active and to play a vigilant role. But we can also take heart that what we have done, when we have done what we can to expose our children to the right values, while there is no guarantee in terms of outcomes but, at least, we have given it our best shot and it is a continuing lifelong journey that we journey with our children.\nMdm Speaker, the Government, together with the community and the individual, must continue to build strong families because, ultimately, as we look at building our nation, we talk about looking forward to SG100, there are many, many different things that we need to do. But we all know that the building blocks of any nation really lies with the individuals and the families. If we have strong families, it gives us a reason to be anchored here, it gives us a reason to build a better future. This is not just for ourselves but it is really very much for our families, for our children, and for their children in turn. We will continue as much as we can to create a pro-family environment for families, and to also support the more vulnerable in our society. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.\n[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]\n[(proc text) Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

(proc text)]\n4.04 pm\nThe Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Law)\n:\nMadam, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".\nMadam, this Bill contains various amendments to several Acts. The amendments are mainly technical in nature. I will highlight the key amendments.\nPresently, the Evidence Act requires the Courts to presume the genuineness of laws and reports of judicial decisions contained in books, where such evidence is tendered in Court. However, as the presumption only applies to those contained in books, it does not apply to laws or reports published online, even if they are published on official websites authorised by the government of a country.\nClause 6 of the Bill extends this presumption by requiring the Court to presume the genuineness of (a) any legislation that is published on an official legislation website; and (b) any law report published on a website that publishes official or authoritative reports of decisions of the courts of a country.\nThe amendment will also make clear that the presumption is applicable only to official or authoritative reports of decisions of the courts of a country.\nClauses 7 and 43 of the Bill contain three main sets of amendments to the Family Justice Act and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act respectively. These amendments seek to: (a) align the right of appeal between family cases and non-family cases; (b) clarify that all family proceedings must be commenced at the Family Court; and (c) introduce immunity provisions for certain groups of individuals.\nLet me first touch on aligning the right of appeal. Presently, under the Family Justice Act, family proceedings can be heard, at first instance, by: (a) the Family Division of the High Court, in which case, appeals are heard by the Court of Appeal; or (b) the Family Courts, in which case, appeals are heard by the High Court.\nThe Bill amends the Family Justice Act to restrict the right of appeal from the Family Court to the High Court, where any order specified in the new Second Schedule is made by the Family Court. This ensures that the right of appeal is consistent across the lower Courts, namely, the Family Court, District Court and Magistrate's Court.\nThe Bill also amends the Supreme Court of Judicature Act to restrict the right of appeal from the Family Division of the High Court to the Court of Appeal, such that certain interlocutory orders made by the Family Division of the High Court are either not appealable, or appealable only with leave of that Court or the Court of Appeal. This aligns the appeal regime in the Family Division of the High Court, with that applicable to non-family proceedings in the High Court.\nI will now touch on the amendments requiring family proceedings to be commenced in the Family Courts. Currently, the practice is for applications for all family proceedings to be filed in the Family Court, except those proceedings which the Chief Justice has directed to be heard and determined by the Family Division of the High Court.\nThe Bill makes this current practice law by providing that all family proceedings must be commenced in the Family Court at first instance, except those classes of family proceedings which the Chief Justice has directed to be heard and determined by the Family Division of the High Court. Presently, this exception applies to probate cases involving estates which exceed $5 million in value.\nFor family proceedings commenced in the Family Court, the current practice has been to transfer contested matters where the assets are above $5 million or, where the case is complex, to the Family Division of the High Court. This practice will continue, subject to any adjustments that may be made by the Chief Justice from time to time.\nLastly, the Bill amends the Family Justice Act and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act to confer certain individuals with protection from personal liability where the acts are done in good faith and do not involve any fraud or wilful misconduct.\nChild representatives, appointed to represent the interests of a child, will be protected from personal liability under the Family Justice Act. Registered medical practitioners, psychologists, counsellors, social workers or mental health professionals appointed by a Family Court or the High Court to examine or assess a child or person will be protected from personal liability under the Family Justice Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act.\nThe immunity provisions ensure that these professionals, who do not represent any of the parties before the Court and lend their expertise to assist the Court in arriving at a fair and just decision, will be able to perform their duties without fear of legal liability, so long as they act in good faith and without fraud or wilful misconduct.\nThe Bill also introduces amendments to the Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act and Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. As the Family Justice Courts hear proceedings under these three Acts, these Acts will be amended to allow the Family Justice Rules Committee to make Family Justice Rules to prescribe the relevant procedure for proceedings under these Acts.\nI will now turn to the amendments arising from the Mental Capacity Act. The Mental Capacity Act was passed in 2008, and it introduced two frameworks to deal with the issues arising from the lack of mental capacity. First, it conferred powers for the Court to appoint deputies to make decisions on behalf of persons who lacked mental capacity. Second, it introduced the Lasting Power of Attorney, a legal instrument which allows individuals to appoint a \"donee\" to make decisions on their behalf should they lose mental capacity.\nThe Bill amends nine Acts to include the reference to a donee of a Lasting Power of Attorney under the Mental Capacity Act, where there is already a reference to a deputy. This ensures that donees will have the same standing as deputies under those Acts, when the donor loses mental capacity.\nI will next turn to the amendments which allow the designation of other political office holders to hear appeals. Clauses 10, 19, 25, 30 and 32 amend the Immigration Act, Massage Establishments Act, Passports Act, Private Security Industry Act and Public Entertainments and Meetings Act respectively, to empower the Minister for Home Affairs to designate other political officeholders of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to hear appeals under these Acts in his place. This is consistent with other newly introduced and recently amended laws and facilitates administration by allowing political officeholders to focus on various responsibilities and portfolios within the Ministry.\nLet me touch on the amendments to the International Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act. In 2015, Singapore signed a Joint Declaration with the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) to allow ITLOS proceedings to be hosted in Singapore in future. ITLOS is an independent judicial body established by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to hear disputes concerning the interpretation or application of UNCLOS.\nClause 12 of the Bill amends the International Organisations (Immunity and Privileges) Act to empower the Government to apply the Act to relevant international organisations and bring ITLOS within the scope of the Act. This ensures that the Government has the power to grant the legal capacities and to confer the privileges and immunities necessary for ITLOS to carry out its functions in Singapore.\nTurning now to the amendments to the Legal Profession Act and the Singapore Academy of Law Act, clauses 16 and 38 of the Bill contain three main sets of amendments to both Acts, namely: (a) to allow the Singapore Institute of Legal Education (SILE) to enact rules for the administration of the Part A course and examinations; (b) to deal with the establishment of the new Law School of SIM University (UniSIM Law School); and (c) to allow the Presiding Judge of the Family Courts and the Presiding Judge of the State Courts to refer matters to the Law Society or the Disciplinary Tribunal.\nClause 16 of the Bill also contains a number of amendments which were proposed by the Law Society of Singapore. Let me explain these amendments in turn.\nFirst is allowing SILE to enact rules for the administration of the Part A Course and Examinations. Since 2015, SILE has taken over the administration of Part A of the Bar Examinations, which is one of the requirements for overseas trained law graduates from overseas scheduled universities to become a qualified person. The amendments to the Legal Profession Act will enable SILE to enact rules to administer and provide for the conditions for entry to the courses, tests and examinations for Part A.\nSecond, the UniSIM Law School was recently established, and its law degrees will be recognised for the purposes of admission to the Singapore Bar, similar to those from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore Management University (SMU). The Legal Profession Act and the Singapore Academy of Law Act will be amended to ensure that UniSIM Law School and the members of its faculty will have the same standing or restrictions as those which are correspondingly applicable to NUS, SMU or their faculty members.\nThird, allowing the Presiding Judge of the Family Justice Courts and the Presiding Judge of the State Courts to refer matters to the Law Society or the Disciplinary Tribunal. Presently, any Judge, Judicial Commissioner, Senior Judge or International Judge of the Supreme Court may refer matters touching on the conduct of any regulated legal practitioner to the Law Society or the Disciplinary Tribunal. The Bill amends the Legal Profession Act to confer the same powers on the Presiding Judge of the Family Justice Courts and the Presiding Judge of the State Courts.\nLastly, there are a number of amendments arising from requests made by the Law Society, which I will summarise.\nFirst, the composition of the Council of the Law Society will be amended in order to better reflect the composition of the members of the Law Society who are entitled to vote for the election of the members of the Council.\nSecond, it will no longer be compulsory for the voting of Council members to be conducted in a physical space via ballot.\nThird, the Council will also be allowed to transfer certain amounts from the Compensation Fund to a fund established by the Law Society to purchase or maintain a library, where no grant is made from the Compensation Fund in any year and there is no application for a grant from the Compensation Fund that is pending at the end of that year.\nClause 15 amends the Legal Aid and Advice Act to enable the Legal Aid Bureau not to charge any registration fees for an application for legal aid or advice. This takes out one step in the registration process and makes it administratively more convenient for applicants when they apply for legal aid.\nClause 35 amends the Remote Gambling Act 2014 to enlarge the jurisdiction of the District Court or a Magistrate's Court to try cases and sentence offenders under that Act. This allows the District Court or a Magistrate's Court to hear cases and impose the maximum fine or imprisonment term set out in the Remote Gambling Act 2014, notwithstanding the limits prescribed under the Criminal Procedure Code.\nCurrently, in contentious proceedings before the Registrar of Trade Marks, there is no avenue for appealing against interlocutory decisions. There can be potentially severe consequences where interlocutory decisions have the effect of bringing proceedings to an end. An example would be when an interlocutory decision leads to a trademark application being treated as withdrawn. Clause 45 amends section 75 of the Trade Marks Act to allow for appeals in such situations.\nClause 50 of the Bill amends the Wills Act to expressly confer our Courts with the power to order rectification of a will upon application of any interested person. The Court may exercise this power where it is satisfied that the will fails to carry out the testator's intentions due to a clerical error or a failure to understand the testator's instructions.\nThis amendment will allow the Courts to better give effect to the testator's testamentary intention. It arises from a recent decision of the Court of Appeal, which strongly suggested that the power to rectify wills is not available to our Courts.\nIn conclusion, Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.\n[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]\nMdm Speaker\n: Ms Sylvia Lim.\n4.18 pm\nMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)\n: Mdm Speaker, I would like to seek some clarifications on the amendments being made to the Wills Act, the Government Proceedings Act and the Legal Profession Act. I declare that I am a lawyer with a Practising Certificate in force.\nFirst, the Wills Act. Clause 50 of the Bill will introduce a new provision to the Wills Act. The new section 28 will allow a Court to order that a will be rectified if the Court is satisfied that the will is expressed in such a way that it fails to carry out the testator's intention due to a clerical error or a failure to understand the testator's instructions, or both. This provision seems to be influenced by legislation in other countries, such as the United Kingdom (UK) Administration of Justice Act 1982, which contains a section 20 similar in wording to the Bill. I have noted that an NUS law academic, Assoc Prof Barry Crown, had recommended that our Wills Act be amended to include such a statutory right to rectify a will to bring more certainty to this area of the law. This is because a 2014 case decided by the UK Supreme Court had suggested that the courts had a common law right to rectify wills even if there is no statutory right, and it is probably more prudent to legislate the right to make clear what powers the court should have.\nNevertheless, the UK case in question, Marley vs Rawlings, also raises questions about how wide the power under the new provision should be. In that case, a husband and wife made mirror wills to leave their entire estate to a non-family member. But each spouse signed the other spouse's will by mistake. Clearly, the lawyer's office was at fault in not checking that the wills were executed by the proper party. What the court did in that case was to exercise the statutory power under the Administration of Justice Act to rectify the wills by replacing wholesale the words of each will with the text of the other spouse's will. This is way beyond the usual understanding of rectification being the adding or omitting of certain words only. Is the Ministry intending the Court to have such a wide rectification power?\nI would also like a confirmation about the implication of such a provision on lawyers who have been negligent in drafting wills or in will execution. How will this provision save them from being liable for negligence? Will clients be expected to go to Court first to try to rectify the will before suing lawyers for negligence? This would put a heavy burden on clients.\nNext, the Government Proceedings Act. The Government Proceedings Act enables the Government to sue and to be sued. Clause 9 of the Bill amends section 29 of the Act to provide that, in such lawsuits, it is possible that the Court can certify that legal costs for more than two Government lawyers may be payable. This is a change from the current position where the maximum number of Government lawyers a litigant may have to pay for is two. According to the explanatory note, the change is to bring the position in line with that in other civil suits and family matters. The current position in other civil suits and family matters is that the Court may order a litigant who loses to pay legal costs for more than two solicitors on the winning side. In order for such a Court order to be obtained, the Court must find that more than two lawyers were reasonably required to handle the case due to factors, such as the complexity of the case or novel points of law being raised.\nMadam, I have concerns about the Government taking such a position as the prospect of a very heavy legal burden in legal costs could have a dampening or even crushing effect on persons involved in suits against the Government. As it currently stands, anyone who is thinking of suing the Government or defending a legal action by the Government is aware that if the action is lost, he would likely have to pay legal costs to the Government. This is on top of funding his own lawyers to meet the fierce challenges thrown by the Government's legal team, whose limitless resources include having the entire Legal Service and Civil Service at its disposal. Not many individuals or entities have the financial resources needed to take the Government to Court or to defend a suit by the Government.\nI believe the Government should consider taking a broader view on this matter and keep the current provision of capping its claim for legal costs to no more than two legal officers. After all, the purpose of the Government Proceedings Act is to enable the Government to sue and to be sued. If the costs of suing or being sued by the Government are too high, people will surrender. There must not be a signal sent that the Government is trying to use the prospect of crushing legal costs to deter or wear down those who may wish to sue the Government or to defend Government lawsuits vigorously.\nLastly, Madam, the Legal Profession Act. Clause 16 of the Bill makes various amendments to the Legal Profession Act. My query relates to clauses 16(t) and (u) which deal with the disciplinary proceedings against lawyers who have misconducted themselves. Under clauses 16(t) and (u), the Minister may make rules to exempt lawyers from disciplinary action if they had given gratifications or remuneration to those who procure business for themselves or other lawyers under circumstances to be prescribed in the rules. The act of giving gratifications for procuring legal services is generally abhorrent to the profession. What sorts of exemptions are being contemplated and under what circumstances?\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Louis Ng.\n4.24 pm\nMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)\n: Madam, I stand in support of this Bill. However, I have two brief clarifications to be made.\nFirstly, the proposed amendment to the Community Mediation Centres Act removes the requirement for the Director of a Community Mediation Centre (CMC) to prepare and submit to the Minister an annual report on the activities, operations and use of the CMC. Consequently, this removes the requirement for the Minister to lay that report before Parliament.\nBased on my house visits and Meet-the-People Sessions, I sense an increasing number of neighbourly disputes. As such, I value the work of the CMC, which provides a neutral platform for residents to resolve relational, social and community disputes amicably without resorting to litigation. Through community mediation, the CMC aims to cultivate a more harmonious, civil and gracious society.\nI also expect that the CMC will be facing an increasing amount of work. As such, I believe the report we are proposing to do away with, would be useful and crucial in allowing us to further detect issues in our community, detect trends, see what has worked and what has not and chart the way forward.\nCan the Senior Minister of State clarify why we are proposing this amendment and, if amended, will there be other forms of reports from the CMC and will these be made available to the public?\nSecondly, there are proposed amendments to the Legal Profession Act, which involves the recategorisation of junior, middle and senior categories of lawyers based on their number of years in practice. Currently, junior lawyers are practitioners with less than seven years of practice, middle category lawyers are those with between seven and 12 years of practice, and lawyers with more than 12 years of practice are senior lawyers.\nBased on statistics obtained from the Law Society of Singapore, as at 31 August 2015, there are only 423 middle category lawyers, as compared to 1,909 junior lawyers and 2,502 senior lawyers.\nIt would appear that the proposed changes to the middle category of lawyers from five to 15 years, instead of the current seven to 12 years, will go some way towards evening out the numbers of lawyers within the various categories.\nCan the Senior Minister of State share the possible underlying causes which have resulted in the legal profession seeing a shrinking middle category of lawyers and whether sufficient steps are being taken to address this concern within the legal profession?\nMdm Speaker, my request for the Government to clarify the above notwithstanding, I support the Bill.\nMdm Speaker\n: Mr Lim Biow Chuan.\n4.26 pm\nMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)\n: Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. This Bill seeks to make several amendments to about 51 Acts, most of which are mainly technical in nature. Several amendments to the Act involve dealings by Government authorities with a person without mental capacity either through his Deputy or through his donee appointed under a Lasting Power of Attorney. Some of the amendments also allow the Minister to designate either the Second Minister, the Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary to hear appeals.\nI wish to raise two queries for the Senior Minister of State. Like my hon colleague Mr Louis Ng, I have a query about clause 3 of the Bill where section 21 of the Community Mediation Centres Act is repealed.\nFrom an accountability point of view, when a Community Mediation Centre is established by the Government and funded by the Government, and the Director and staff are deemed public servants, surely the Director should continue to provide a report to the Minister. This is to allow proper accountability of civil servants to the Executive arm of the Government. I am also of the view that the Minister ought to continue to lay the report before Parliament and account for the activities and efficacy of the Community Mediation Centres. So, could I ask the Senior Minister of State to clarify the rationale for repealing section 21 of the Community Mediation Centres Act?\nThe next clarification required is on the amendment to the Work Injury Compensation Act. Mdm Speaker, there was a recent case involving an engineer who had lost mental capacity following an accident. His next-of-kin had purportedly accepted compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act but, subsequently, his brother, who was appointed as a deputy under the Mental Capacity Act, then proceeded to sue the employer for damages under common law instead of claiming for compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act.\nI note that the amendment to this Act states that section 22(2) of the Act has been deleted and the following has been substituted. Let me cite the section 22(2) which has been substituted. It says: \"Where it appears to the Commissioner that compensation or interest is payable to an employee under this Act and the employee lacks capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act, before such payment is made, it is lawful for the Commissioner to receive and pay the compensation or interest to any one or more of the dependants of the employee for the benefit of the employee, even if there is no donee of a Lasting Power of Attorney which is granted by the employee under the Mental Capacity Act and under which the employee confers on the donee authority to receive the compensation or interest, and even if there is no deputy who is appointed or deemed to be appointed for the employee by the Court under the Mental Capacity Act and who is conferred power to receive compensation or interest\".\nThis section seems to suggest that the Commissioner of Labour continues to have the power to receive and pay compensation to any one or more of dependants even if there was no donee, even if there is no deputy appointed.\nA dependant under this Act is quite rightly crafted and it means the wife, husband, parent, grandparents, stepfather, stepmother, child, grandchild, stepchild, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, stepbrother, or stepsister, irrespective of whether that person is actually dependent on the employee's earnings or not.\nIf I may ask the Senior Minister of State, in light of the recent case in the High Court in April 2015, Justice Quentin Loh had made a decision and, in that decision, he had said that \"In my judgement, the next-of-kin of a mentally incapacitated employee do not have, without more, the requisite capacity to make a claim under the Act on behalf of the employee. Only a person duly appointed by the Court under the Mental Capacity Act will have the legal capacity to do so\".\nI am sorry if this House is struggling to understand what I am saying because this is quite legalistic. That was a High Court case made in April 2015 and, in March this year, the Court of Appeal had affirmed that particular decision. In  light of what the Courts are saying, which is that only someone who is either a donee appointed under a Lasting Power of Attorney or someone who is appointed by the Court under the Mental Capacity Act as a deputy would have the power to make such a claim.\nCould the Senior Minister of State clarify who would be the rightful person to make a claim to the Commissioner of Labour and whether that decision made by the next-of-kin or dependant is final and binding on the employee's dependant because the law and the case law seem to say something differently? I think it would be useful for the Senior Minister of State to clarify that. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.\nMdm Speaker\n: Senior Minister of State Indranee Rajah.\n4.32 pm\nMs Indranee Rajah\n: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Members for their comments and for their support of the Bill.\nMr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Louis Ng asked about the amendment to the Community Mediation Act and the removal of the need for the CMC to submit an Annual Report.\nMdm Speaker, we continually review our laws to see if our processes are still relevant or if the objectives of those processes can be achieved by other means. In this case, the CMC is a department of the Ministry of Law (MinLaw), which is held accountable through its accounts and budget estimates which are available in the annual Budget Book which is presented to Parliament. However, we do agree that information on the activities and the operations of the CMC should be available to the public. Insofar, as information and statistics relating to the CMC are concerned, they will continue to be available on the CMC website, and this includes statistics on the number of mediations conducted, CMC's success rate and the types of disputes handled by CMC.\nMr Lim Biow Chuan raised two queries on the amendments to the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA): first, whether next-of-kin who are not donees or deputies may submit claims to the Commissioner of Labour; and second, what happens if the Commissioner of Labour errs in his assessment as to whether there is a donee or deputy.\nI should clarify at the outset that the purpose of this particular amendment to WICA in this Bill is simply to ensure that donees have the same standing as deputies under the Act. So, in other words, wherever you see deputy, the donee will have the same standing. This particular amendment is not intended to address the larger question, which is whether other third parties are entitled to file claims or receive compensation under WICA. There has been a recent decision by the Court of Appeal, as Mr Lim Biow Chuan has alluded to, on this wider issue, and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is studying the implications of this decision. So, it would be premature for me to make any remarks on that at this moment. MOM would see what implication the Court of Appeal's decision has.\nWith regard to the amendments to the Legal Profession Act, Mr Louis Ng queried the possible underlying causes leading to the shrinking middle category of lawyers and what steps were being taken to address this concern. In May 2013, the report of the 4th Committee on the Supply of Lawyers identified three main factors as causing or contributing to attrition among legal professionals. They were unsustainable work practices, unsuitability of the individual legal professional for legal work and structural problems within law firms.\nTo address this issue of attrition, the 4th Committee recommended that the two existing local law schools should consider a more targeted selection of law school applicants and help prepare young graduates early for the realities of practice, for example, by expanding clinical legal programmes currently offered. And to address the work-life balance concerns by providing flexibility in legal practice, for example, allowing flexible schedules or different career tracks for lawyers and by providing greater support and welfare, for example, by providing lawyers with tools to create a better working environment.\nTackling these issues will take time and require a concerted effort on the part of the law schools and the legal profession as a whole. Steps are being taken to look into this. The Law Society is presently conducting a study to look into how junior lawyers can be encouraged to stay in practice which, in turn, will help the number of lawyers in this middle category. The findings of their study should be available later in the year.\nThere are also longer-term initiatives which have taken these concerns into account. For example, the third law school at UniSIM will select its students based not just on academic ability but also aptitude, attitude and interest in the practice of family and criminal law. Their curriculum will be practice-oriented, culminating in a six-month practicum training, so that students will be better prepared and equipped for the realities of practice. So, this will deal, to some extent, with the second problem identified by the 4th Committee, in relation to the unsuitability of individuals for legal work.\nI should also highlight that the lawyers represented by the original middle category are more limited, compared to the junior and senior categories. It represents five cohorts of lawyers: those between seven and 12 years of standing. In comparison, the junior and senior categories represent lawyers under seven years' standing and not less than 12 years' standing respectively, which is a larger number of cohorts. In addition, the statistics relate to the number of lawyers who remain in private practice in law firms. Some of those who leave private practice remain in the legal profession as in-house counsel in the private sector, or by joining the public sector or academia. Others move into other industries, such as investment banking, fund management, private equity, where their legal skills come in useful, and they continue to make a meaningful contribution to the wider economy.\nI believe Ms Sylvia Lim has asked a number of questions, the first relating to the Wills Act and the scope of the power to be given to the Courts. What is driving this amendment was the Singapore Court of Appeal's decision in Cheo Yeo and Associates and another where the Court of Appeal held obiter that the remedy of rectification of wills is not available in Singapore. The Court of Appeal's decision strongly suggested that where a will fails to embody the intentions of the testator due to a clerical error or a failure to understand the testator's intention, the Singapore Courts do not have the power to correct the error in the will.\nThis particular amendment was intended to address that and to give the Court the power to correct a clerical error or to give effect to the testator's intention where there was a failure to understand that intention.\nWith respect to costs, that is really just intended to bring the position with respect to the Government in alignment with that for other parties in normal civil proceedings, and the costs remains at the discretion of the Courts. It is not intended to give the Government any additional power but just to bring it in line with other normal civil proceedings.\nMdm Speaker:\nMs Sylvia Lim.\n4.40 pm\nMs Sylvia Lim\n: Madam, I have three clarifications for the Senior Minister of State. First, she did not touch on my query on the Legal Profession Act amendments, clause 16(t) and (u). What are the circumstances contemplated under which the Minister would prescribe rules to exempt lawyers who had, on the face of it, committed some misconduct, according to what is raised in the Bill?\nThe second clarification concerns the Wills Act. The Senior Minister of State mentioned that it was spurred on by the recent Court of Appeal's case. But I would like her to confirm whether the inspiration for the wording came from the UK and whether she is aware of the case which I cited, Marley vs Rawlings, which interpreted that provision very widely and whether it is the intention of the Government to give the Court this kind of width of rectification power.\nMy third clarification concerns the cost of Government proceedings. The Senior Minister of State mentioned that this does not give the Government additional powers, but the fact is that under the existing section 29 of the Government Proceedings Act (GPA), the cost claimable is limited to two. So, this amendment would actually give an allowance for the Court to certify more than two lawyers' costs being payable. It is a change to the legal position, as far as  GPA is concerned. I have my grave reservations about this clause for the reasons I stated earlier.\nMdm Speaker\n: Senior Minster of State.\nMs Indranee Rajah\n: Madam, with respect to the costs, as I had indicated, the idea was to just bring it in line with what is available to other civil parties, that means, even where the Government is not involved. So, it is not intended to be used in an oppressive manner but really where if costs are incurred, it gives the Court the discretion to allow costs for more than two counsel, if the Court really thinks that this is an appropriate case to do so. So, the safeguard there is that it lies in the hands of the Courts.\nWith respect to the question on the Wills Act, I am not able to comment if there was a specific reference to the UK case. What I can say is that we had specific regard to our Court of Appeal's case and, the intention, as I had indicated, was to make sure that our Courts have the power to rectify a clerical error or our Courts have the power to give effect to the testator's intention. That, really, is, as I have stated, the intent behind this.\nWith respect to the third question, I think that the Minister would have to look at it on a case-by-case basis. I am not setting out any specific guidelines in this instance. But basically, when the Minister looks at it, he would have due regard as to what cases should be exempted.\nMdm Speaker:\nMs Sylvia Lim.\nMs Sylvia Lim\n: Madam, I need to clarify further with the Senior Minister of State on the issue of cost. The point here, of course, is that when you have the Government on one side of a legal proceeding and perhaps a private individual or private entity on the other side, you are dealing with an inequality of resources in most cases. The Government, with its Legal Officers, having the whole Civil Service there, the prospect of a litigant going into litigation with the Government and sustaining that litigation, I think it is already prohibitive to most people.\nSo, my question is, why is the Government not able to take a broader view, you may want to say, even a magnanimous view or perhaps a view from the accountability standpoint that, look, we are not going to allow cost to be an inhibition or prohibitive factor when the litigant decides whether to continue with litigation or to commence litigation with the Government or not.\nI am sure the Government does not need the money. So, the question is, why do you need to change that position to allow for more than two lawyers' costs to be claimed? Why can the Government not limit its position to two?\nMdm Speaker\n: Senior Minister of State.\nMs Indranee Rajah\n: Madam, it is not always the case that somebody who brings the proceedings against the Government is impecunious. I just want to flag that as a first point. So, there are any number of parties with different situations and they may have different financial means.\nThe second point as to why it is necessary or why should the Government not limit itself, the answer is that there is no one size fits all when it comes to the issue of costs. There will be some instances where a lot of work is required and where it is very complex, and where there will be others where it is much more straightforward and simpler.\nAt the end of the day, it is really for the Court to decide. And our Courts, in this matter, I believe, are objective and fair. The idea is that if it is a case that really a lot of work was incurred, and it appears to the Court that it is fair and just to award costs for more than two counsel in such a situation, the Court can do so; but if the Court, having taken into account the circumstances of the case, feels that it is not equitable to do so, then it will be up to the Court. So, at the end of the day, I think it rests with the Court to do the right thing, with respect to costs.\nMdm Speaker:\nMr Dennis Tan.\nMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)\n:\nMadam, just a point of clarification for the Senior Minister of State. Regarding the case law of the UK case that is cited by Ms Sylvia Lim, I just want to ask for the Senior Minister of State's clarification. I am not sure I understand the Senior Minister of State's answer, but I think for judicial guidance, if it is not the intention of the Government that the UK Supreme Court decision is intended to be applied, then perhaps the Government can state its position now so that the Courts will be able to follow accordingly when the Bill is passed.\nMdm Speaker\n: Senior Minister of State.\nMs Indranee Rajah\n: Madam, I thank Mr Dennis Tan for his clarification. I am sorry if I was not sufficiently clear just now. First, it was prompted by our Court of Appeal's decision, but when the Government drafted these provisions, the Government did look at the UK case and some of the wordings were based on that. That is as far as I can go. Obviously, when our Courts apply it, and when they look at other precedents, our Courts will have to give effect to the law as our Courts see correct. What I do not want to do, is to suggest in any way that our Courts are bound by another court's decision.\nSo, the short answer to the Member's question of whether we looked at the UK case in question, the answer is yes. But as to what was it that prompted this particular amendment, it was our Court of Appeal's decision.\nMdm Speaker:\nMs Sylvia Lim.\nMs Sylvia Lim\n:\nMadam, I do not want to belabour the point, but I would just like to record my reservation about clause 9. Notwithstanding what the Senior Minister of State has said about the Courts being a safeguard, I do feel that the Government could have taken a different view to make it clear that it would not want to be seen to be, in a sense, using legal cost as a deterrent or prohibitive factor when it comes to litigation with the Government. So, I want to record my reservation about that clause. I note that the Bill is very broad-ranging, and I will not oppose the Bill, but I have grave reservations about that clause.\nMdm Speaker\n: Senior Minister of State.\nMs Indranee Rajah\n:\nMadam, I think what I can say is this: when this Government is engaged in litigation, whether it is brought by somebody else or whether the Government has reasons to initiate it, the Government does its best to be fair, objective and rational about it. So, it would not be our approach to use costs to be oppressive, but to seek costs where we think that it is fairly and justly incurred and to leave it to the Court to make the appropriate decision on the quantum of costs to be awarded and the number of counsels to be taken into account.\nMdm Speaker:\nMr Low Thia Khiang.\nMr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)\n: Mdm Speaker, on the same point made by Ms Sylvia Lim on clause 9, I am wondering whether this will raise the perception of Singaporeans that the Government is using the cost to intimidate Singaporeans in bringing any legal case against the Government. So, you have no choice whether you think you are being wrongly or rightly prosecuted, but because you look at the cost, you say, \"Oh let's forget about it, let's pay.\"\nSo, is that a good thing for Singapore as a society? That the people who feel somehow victimised by the Government are intimidated by the cost; you do not know how much the Court is going to decide. In the past, you said, \"Okay, it is limited to two lawyers\", but now, there will be more. So, the sense of intimidation of Singaporeans, I think, does not spell well for the future of Singapore.\nMdm Speaker\n: Senior Minister of State.\nMs Indranee Rajah\n: Mdm Speaker, I said it before, once; I said it before, twice; and I will now say it again a third time. It is not the intention of the Government to be using costs to intimidate anyone. As I have indicated, when the Government has to defend a matter or pursue a matter, it will do so after having taken advice, doing so rationally and doing so if it thinks that it is the right course of action. That is the first thing when it comes to taking proceedings.\nWith respect to the amount of costs that a person may face, when a person brings proceedings against the Government, that person would, no doubt, be legally advised, and also have an indication of the amount of costs that would be incurred. And it should not be forgotten that if costs ought to be awarded against that party, it does mean that that party, at the end of the day, ultimately failed against the Government. Meaning that, that case should not have been brought in the first place.\nAnd the final safeguard is really the Court. It is in the hands of the Court to ensure that the amounts of costs that are awarded are fair and just. And as I have said, this Government will pursue a course that is reasonable and rational and that the costs sought are commensurate with the claim. So, it is not the intention of the Government to intimidate anyone.\nMdm Speaker:\nMr Low, I must stop this clarification, because you have made your point, Ms Sylvia Lim has made the same point, Mr Dennis Tan has made the same point, clarification sought. Senior Minister of State Indranee Rajah has already made her replies. I do not think there is going to be any further development by continuing with the clarification.\n[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

It supports caregivers in caring for seniors at home.\nOver 29,000 seniors have benefited from SMF since its establishment in 2011. Of these, about 15,800 seniors received subsidies for mobility devices, such as wheelchairs, motorised wheelchairs and walking aids.\nThe demand for devices and transport services for seniors is growing. We have, therefore, prioritised our funding to target the purchase of essential mobility equipment, rather than maintenance and repair, including battery replacement. Nonetheless, we have provided, on a case-by-case basis, SMF subsidy to some seniors with a critical need for the device but no financial means to replace a battery or repair the device.\nWe will continue to review the scope of the SMF as needs of seniors evolve, within the fiscal resources available for this scheme.",

Centralised exhaust systems were introduced during the HUP. These systems are typically fitted with baffle filters to reduce the grease in cooking fumes.\nFor new centres, besides a centralised exhaust system with baffle filters, the National Environment Agency (NEA) also considers the installation of additional air cleaning systems such as carbon filters, ultraviolet lamps or electrostatic precipitators in their exhaust systems to prevent grease or odour issues.\nCurrently, four hawker centres have additional air cleaning systems such as carbon filters installed in their exhaust systems. If there are issues related to the exhaust system of specific hawker centres, NEA will look into the feedback and work with the relevant stakeholders, including Town Councils for Housing and Development Board (HDB) centres, to explore appropriate solutions for the centres such as replacing the motors in the exhaust system or installing carbon filters in the exhaust system, if necessary.",

It also includes the cost of providing other value-added functions, such as capabilities for collection and dissemination of traffic information,  electronic payment for roadside parking, checkpoint tolls and usage of off-peak cars.\nBoth tender bids received were of good technical quality.

As PMDs are generally safe, most of these countries do not mandate helmets and insurance for cyclists or PMD users. In our case, PMDs are not allowed on roads and have to abide by speed limits of 15 kilometres per hour on footpaths and 25 kilometres per hour on shared and cycling paths. These rules provide further safeguards to pedestrians. We are aware that some cyclists and PMDs voluntarily wear helmets or buy insurance as an added precaution. For now, we have decided not to impose additional costs on everyone by making helmets and insurance compulsory. Let us monitor the situation and keep an open mind on whether a change is warranted in future.\nAt the same time, we need to educate users and enforce against those who flout the rules. Cyclists and PMD users have to be very mindful of the safety of pedestrians. They should always give way to pedestrians, including children and the frail. This is our consistent message to them: be considerate and gracious, give way to pedestrians for your own safety and that of other path users.",

Taxi operators are allowed to pay the Category A Prevailing Quota Premium for their COEs, regardless of the model of taxi being registered, in recognition of their public transport role. The Taxi Availability standards were also introduced, and taxi operators can grow their fleets by up to 2% per annum, subject to them meeting the standards.\nSince the introduction of the standards, more taxis are plying the roads to serve commuters, especially during peak hours, and the taxis are being more efficiently utilised. We will not be removing this COE concession for taxis nor the cap on taxi fleet growth for now. We will continue to regularly review the issue.",

These investments are expected to generate total business expenditure per annum of S$34 billion, value-added per annum of S$77 billion, as well as create 107,000 jobs when fully implemented.\nEDB adopts a targeted approach to investment promotion, attracting projects that are in line with Singapore's competitive strengths as well as our constraints in manpower, land and planned international commitments on carbon emissions.\nBesides attracting new investments, EDB also works closely with other Government agencies to support existing companies in Singapore to strengthen their competitiveness, raise productivity and create good job opportunities for locals. For example, EDB partners the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) to engage companies on equipping their local workers with the relevant skills for their jobs. Where relevant, companies are also encouraged to redesign jobs to meet the needs of older workers through schemes, such as WorkPro, which is jointly developed by MOM and WDA.",

Residents in Simei and Changi have access to a network of three public libraries located next to the Tampines, Bedok and Pasir Ris Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations. Bedok and Pasir Ris libraries are smaller branch libraries, while the library in Tampines is a regional library with a wide range of services designed to serve the broader eastern region.\nThe population in these areas is increasing. NLB recently studied how to better serve the growing number of residents there and concluded that the best approach was to upgrade all three libraries. The Pasir Ris Public Library was thus revamped and reopened in November 2015. The Tampines Regional Library will be expanded to about twice its current size. The Bedok Public Library will be redeveloped at the nearby Bedok Integrated Complex, offering more diverse spaces. All residents in the East, including in Simei and Changi, will benefit from these enhancements.\nIn addition, NLB supports community-led initiatives to set up reading corners and community libraries, by training resident volunteers and providing a seed collection of library materials. NLB is currently working with a group of residents to set up a community library in the Changi-Simei area.",

    "content": "6\nDr Lim Wee Kiak\nasked the Minister for Home Affairs given the recent spate of multiple-vehicle pile-ups on our highway (a) how often are reviews made for the L-drivers' syllabus conducted by driving centres and schools so that what is taught is relevant to current road traffic conditions; and (b) how are driving instructors regulated to ensure that they keep up-to-date.\nMr K Shanmugam\n: The recent multiple-vehicle pileups have mainly been caused by motorists' failure to keep a proper lookout or  maintain proper control of their vehicles. These core driving skills are already included in the driving school syllabus for learner motorists. The syllabus for learner motorists includes both theory and practical components and is designed to teach the basics of driving. The syllabus is regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains up to date with the latest road traffic rules and regulations and the road safety situation. Over the last few years, Traffic Police has updated the syllabus to include new elements, such as driving on slope for those learning to drive automatic-transmission motor cars, and emergency braking on wet surfaces and expressway familiarisation for those learning to ride motorcycles.\nThe syllabus is taught by driving instructors who are regulated by the Traffic Police through a licensing regime stipulated under the Road Traffic Act and the Road Traffic (Driving Instructors and Driving Schools) Rules. Driving instructors at the driving schools take an annual Instructors' Skill and Knowledge Evaluation to ensure that they continue to keep up to date.\nLearner motorists have to complete the syllabus and pass the driving test before obtaining a driving licence. Beyond learning driving and passing the driving test, motorists have to continue to drive safely and obey traffic rules when on the road. This is especially relevant in our efforts to improve road safety and reduce accidents. Traffic Police will continue to educate road users and step up enforcement efforts to maintain safety on our roads.",

There were 14 such fires in 2013, 12 in 2014, and seven in 2015.\nThe Fire Code, which is administered under the Fire Safety Act, stipulates fire safety requirements in buildings, including coffee shops that are sited within HDB blocks. The requirements applicable to coffee shops include the provision of ventilation openings for smoke dispersion, and separation of kitchens via fire-resistant walls if open flame-cooking appliances are used, in order to reduce the risk of fire spreading to other adjoining spaces. Alternatively, the Fire Code requires that the kitchens be equipped with fire-extinguishing systems to minimise the risk of fire spreading. There are also a number of other risk mitigation requirements.\nThe Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has been working closely with HDB to ensure that operators of food and beverage outlets in HDB premises including coffeeshops, comply with the fire safety measures. The SCDF also partners the National Environment Agency (NEA) to advise NEA food establishment licensees to clean the exhaust systems and ductings in their regular maintenance regimes.\nThe SCDF takes a risk-based approach, assessing the benefit of any requirement, against the risks. The current SCDF requirements take into account that the fires at coffee shops in HDB blocks over the past three years have been confined to the affected premises, with no fire spread to the residential units above the coffee shops.",

The reports included complaints against moneylenders charging high fees and interest rates, as well as extending credit in breach of the unsecured credit limits. The Registry also conducts regular inspections on moneylenders so as to ensure that their practices are in compliance with the Moneylenders Act and Rules. Where moneylenders or their officers are found to have committed offences under the Act or Rules, the Registry will take decisive action against them.\nIn 2015, 17 moneylenders were subjected to licensing action, such as revocation of licence and forfeiture of security deposit. Nine moneylenders or officers of moneylending companies were warned or offered composition, while six other such individuals were prosecuted and convicted in Court. These included matters that arose from complaints made in 2014.\nIn regulating the moneylending industry, we seek to maintain a balance between protecting borrowers and ensuring that there is reasonable access to credit from licensed sources. Over the last three years, there has been an increasing trend in terms of the value of loans granted by the industry. During the same period, a number of measures were also introduced to strengthen protection for borrowers, such as controls on interest rates and fees, which were implemented in 2015. We will be implementing further regulatory changes in the coming months.",

The remaining cases were withdrawn or are still under consideration.\nMost of the rejected applications for charity registration were unable to meet registration requirements, such as having objects which were exclusively charitable. Some were rejected due to the lack of substantive activities, programmes or plans to demonstrate their sustainability. Others were rejected because they did not have clear intended beneficiaries or because their activities did not substantially benefit the community in Singapore.\nThe main reasons for rejecting IPC applications were poor governance, qualified audited financial statements, regulatory non-compliance or because applicants conducted activities which were not wholly beneficial to the community in Singapore.",

Nonetheless, we recognise the value of these greenery and biodiversity systems and make a constant effort to sustain them. Today, there are four gazetted Nature Reserves and 20 recognised Nature Areas in Singapore. Nature Reserves and Nature Areas make up about 5% and 3% of Singapore’s land area respectively. Together, they occupy about 5,400 hectares. This is a significant size and is equivalent to about eight Ang Mo Kio towns, or almost half of all housing land in Singapore.\nIn addition to setting aside land for Nature Reserves and Nature Areas, we have been adopting unique solutions to conserve nature in our urban setting. For instance, by incorporating green spaces extensively within our urban environment, we have retained a fascinating diversity of native plant species in our city. We have also weaved nature deep into our heartlands through an extensive network of park connectors, Nature Ways and projects like the Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters Programme.
