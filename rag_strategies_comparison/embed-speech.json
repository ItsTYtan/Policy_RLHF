      "(Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]\nThis outreach, engagement and targeted public education against drug use and abuse should also be done concurrently with the fight against smoking. To me, the addiction to smoking and drug use is one and the same, and should be done in tandem, since the smoking habit seems to create a propensity towards smoking or taking drugs as well. In addition, I hope CNB and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) can find ways to curb online peddling of drugs more effectively and take tougher enforcement actions on those who are buying drugs online. Never mind that the amount of drugs is small, and never mind that the perpetrators are committing it for the first time, but that they are young. The message must be clear. We do not tolerate drug trafficking and use. At this point, Deputy Speaker, Sir, please allow me to continue in Malay.\n(\nIn Malay\n)\n:\n[\nPlease refer to\nVernacular Speech\n.]\nThe war on drugs is a joint effort by all of us. We need pervasive approaches so as to reach out to and educate our young on the damaging and irreversible effects of both smoking and drug use. Support and assistance from influential personalities and positive role models that our young look up to, strengthen this approach. I understand that local personalities, such as Taufik Batisah and Irfan Fandi, have joined in this fight against drug abuse by offering their time and energy. I look forward to more support from such personalities and positive role models for our young.\nAt the same time, support from home is also important in shaping positive mindsets among our youths in this fight against drug abuse. We need parents to be positive role models for their children − not just by advising them to stay drug-free or smoke-free − but to also role model positive behaviour and healthy lifestyles, free from addiction of any sort.\nThis reminds me of one of my residents. Ms Lydia is still relatively young, barely 40 years old. But each time I met her, she looked haggard and worried, as though she was over 50 years old. Her husband is incarcerated because of drug abuse even though he is already in his 50s. And this is not the first time he had been in prison because of drugs. They have three children − two studying in primary school and one who is three years old.\nThroughout the time Ms Lydia is married to her husband, she did not work and depended on him for financial support. With her husband's recent incarceration, Ms Lydia finds herself with no source of income. We tried our best to help her by providing her with temporary financial assistance. At the same time, we also helped Ms Lydia find part-time work and get a place for her youngest child in a childcare centre so that Ms Lydia can work. Although Ms Lydia is a strong woman who remains undaunted, the social and emotional impact on her and her children, who are now unable to see their father, is quite deep and cannot be easily forgotten. Their family relationship has definitely been affected.\nSupport from the family is much needed, not just when our children or family member have succumbed to drug addiction or smoking, but even before they become a slave to addiction. Developing positive habits and a healthy lifestyle − such as doing sports as a family, spending time on a common hobby with family members and close friends, or by volunteering and doing meaningful work for our community − will help each and every one of us to keep addiction at bay.\n(\nIn English\n): I must admit that the drug scourge in Singapore is not isolated or that only our local agencies have to step up in terms of outreach, education and enforcement. The drug scourge is certainly a global one.\nWhat is equally worrying is the callous claims by some pro-cannabis and pro-marijuana proponents that small amounts of cannabis use is perfectly alright, or that there are medical conditions, such as glaucoma or Parkinson's disease, that can be managed through daily doses of cannabis or marijuana or ganga, whatever name it is known as. We would also need the help of medical professionals and research experts to verify such claims and, more importantly, to curb the incorrect perception that small doses of drug use on a daily basis are perfectly fine.\nSir, the drug situation is far from rosy and the fight against drug use and abuse is far from over. We would need all parties to come together to do this to help ourselves and our future generations − parents, schools, the Government, popular personalities − all have important roles to play. We need to do this together.\nGetting rid of an addiction is certainly not easy. It takes a lot of courage, discipline and inner strength and, of course, support from our loved ones. But it is not impossible.\nWhen it comes to addiction: \"I can choose to let it define me; confine me; outshine me; or I can choose to move on and leave it behind me.\" Thank you, Sir. I support the Motion.",
      "(Mr Baey Yam Keng)\n: Chairman, I visited the Community Rehabilitation Centre (CRC) recently. It is a community-based drug rehabilitation centre run by Trybe, a youth sector organisation. It houses male first-time drug abusers between the ages 16 and 21. During the visit, I also learnt of the changing profile of drug abusers and drugs used in Singapore over the years.\nAt the CRC, the approach taken is to immerse residents in a relationship-driven, transformational environment to lead a purposeful and drug-free life.\nI am glad to know that we are taking a differentiated approach to help different drug abusers. Rehabilitation is one of the three key components in tackling the drug problems here; the other two being education and deterrence.\nOther countries are increasingly taking a soft stance towards drugs, and liberal attitudes are seeping into our youth through social media and other channels. One of the residents at CRC shared that he was first introduced to drugs by the beach while on holiday.\nIt is becoming more important that we set out our own narrative to counter inaccurate perceptions, to explain our approach and to show its effectiveness. I would like to ask MHA for an update on its response to drug challenges and how to maintain public support for our tough stance on drugs.\nDrugs in our Society\nMr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade)\n:",
      "Mr Vikram Nair\n: Chairman, in many parts of the world, drug use is a problem getting out of control. Even in developed countries like the US, the opioid crisis haunts many of its largest cities. Thousands of lives are ruined by the ready availability of drugs all over the world.\nSingapore has remained a relative oasis against this scourge thanks to a combination of strong laws, including the death penalty, against drug trafficking. Strong enforcement of the laws and national education as well support these measures. Singapore's rates of drug addiction have been amongst the lowest in the world.\nConcerningly though, Central Narcotics Bureau's (CNB's) latest figures on drug use amongst youths shows a larger number of arrests over the last two years amongst users below 20 years old. Do these figures suggest growing drug use amongst youths? What are MHA's strategies for dealing with the rise of drug use amongst youths in Singapore?\nScams\nChairman, Singapore is amongst the safest cities in the world and we are proud of our low crime rates. Unfortunately, one area of vulnerability for us has been scams. According to reports, last year, our people lost $1.1 billion to scams, with the largest number of cases ever reported. The figure is around 70% higher than the $651.8 million that scammers took in 2023.\nIn recent years, MHA has taken a variety of measures to combat scams, including better education and publicity, rolling out the ScamShield app and engaging in cooperation internationally to try and crack down on scam operators. Notwithstanding these measures, it appears the problem continues to grow and scammers are thriving.\nThe most recent measures include action being taken against Singaporeans who may have assisted foreign scammers, including those who help with opening bank accounts that are being used to facilitate scams.\nWould the MHA consider taking stricter measures to better detect and deter local Singaporeans from assisting scam operations, in particular, by being money mules?\nIn some ways, this is similar to the measures we have taken against drug traffickers and illegal moneylenders. While we may be unable to take action against foreign principals, by taking a zero-tolerance approach against their agents in Singapore, we managed to bring both of those problems under better control.\nI understand from previous COS debates that the transnational nature of scams makes it difficult to both combat scams and recover the victims' assets. Does the MHA have any further thoughts on how this may be addressed?\nThe Chairman\n:"

      "(Mr Amrin Amin)\n: Mr Chairman, I will focus on two areas: first, keeping Singapore drug-free; and second, supporting the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.\nMembers spoke about the fight against drugs. Mr Christopher de Souza spoke about stemming the supply and demand of drugs. Keeping Singapore drug-free is a key priority for MHA. This requires a combination of tough laws, effective enforcement and preventive education.\nThe Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has kept up enforcement efforts. Last year, CNB dismantled 23 drug syndicates, and conducted 19 islandwide operations targeting drug traffickers and abusers. CNB also conducted 12 joint operations with our foreign counterparts to cut out drug supplies from overseas. Just last week, CNB had a joint operation with their Malaysian counterparts to smash a regional drug syndicate.\nMr Christopher de Souza and Mr Baey Yam Keng spoke about emerging drug threats such as the purchase of drugs online and New Psychoactive Substances. These are indeed areas of concern. There are people in Singapore who have tried to buy drugs online. They thought they could get away with it. They were wrong. Last year, CNB worked with courier companies to detect more than 350 parcels with drugs or drug-related products. CNB’s follow-up investigations led to the arrest of 177 individuals. We will continue to clamp down online drug trade.\nNew Psychoactive Substances, or “NPS”, is a global challenge that many countries are grappling with. So far, the NPS situation in Singapore is contained. This is because we keep a close watch for any new substances, and list them in our Misuse of Drugs Act. Regular reviews of our legislative and operational strategies are conducted to combat NPS abuse. Enforcement alone is not enough. To keep Singapore drug-free, all Singaporeans must know that drugs are harmful and stay away from them.\nMr Edwin Tong and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked how we can better engage youths and tackle the high proportion of new and young drug abusers.\nIn 2017, two out of five abusers arrested were new abusers. Close to two-thirds, or 64%, of new abusers arrested were under 30 years old. This is very worrying and there are foreign celebrities who glamourise drug use and they falsely advocate drugs as harmless and “cool”. Our youths must not be fooled.\nMinister earlier mentioned about Portuguese campaign − \"Say no to second-hand syringes\". In Singapore, we have a different campaign. We promote a drug-free life. We advocate a life free from addiction and we encourage our youths to enjoy life to the fullest and make the best of life's opportunities. Be yourself. Hashtag. Be drug-free – these are taglines that are trending here in Singapore. This is the narrative: we reject drugs and we reject the notion that drugs are harmless or \"cool\". They destroy life, health and family; and drug abuse is not a victimless crime.\nWe have ramped up our preventive drug education efforts in the last year, both on the ground and on social media. Besides school programmes and roadshows, CNB collaborated with education institutions and young local filmmakers to produce a series of videos showing the destructive effect of drugs.\nEighteen short films were posted on CNB’s Instagram and Facebook with the handle #FilmFriday, racking up close to two million views in total.\nTo reach out to more youths, CNB also set up a makeshift club called “GURD Club” outside Cathay Cineplex. “GURD Club” featured lights and sounds which simulated the disorientating and distressing effects of drugs. More than 4,300 anti-drug pledges were collected.\nOur community is with us in this fight against drugs. Our United Against Drugs Coalition partners include Pastamania and Singapore Post, just to name a few, and they have helped to distribute 50,000 “DrugFreeSG” keychains to the public during our Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign last year. Online retailer Reebonz distributed 5,000 anti-drug message cards in their parcels during Christmas last year.\nMs Rahayu Mahzam spoke about engaging the community, especially the Malay Muslim community. Mr Chairman, please allow me to speak in Malay on this.\n(\nIn Malay\n)\n:",
      "Mr K Shanmugam\n: As the Member pointed out, New Psychoactive Substances, also known as NPS, have been wrongly perceived by some people to be less addictive and less dangerous. Nothing could be further from the truth. These drugs are known to have adverse, irreversible physical and psychological effects.\nThe Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) adopts a targeted approach to raise awareness about the harms of drugs. Since 2016, CNB has been driving an online campaign to strengthen the resilience of our youths against drug misinformation. They are provided with facts about the harms of drugs, including NPS, to counter the false information being propagated online that downplays the danger. CNB has enhanced its social media platforms to push out its messages. Many of the anti-drug videos posted online by CNB have been widely viewed. CNB will continue with these social media campaigns to feature bite-sized infographics and youth-centric content.\nTo address the increasingly liberal attitudes among youths, the National Council Against Drug Abuse, or NCADA, launched a \"Feed Ambition. Fight Temptation\" campaign in October 2018. Opinion leaders were roped in to engage youths in a mentorship programme, encouraging them to pursue their passion and stay away from drugs.\nYouths are also given the opportunity to take greater ownership in the fight against drugs. In December last year, a new illustrated book \"Captain Drug Buster versus Dr Wacko: The Final Showdown\" was published. This was a collaboration with young illustrators. The book educates children on the harms of drug abuse, and serves as a resource for parents and educators to start the conversation on drugs with the young ones. We will make copies of the book widely available.\nCNB has also been engaging NS commanders and educators on a sustained basis, to raise their awareness and understanding of Singapore’s drug control policies, as well as to rally their support for anti-drug advocacy.\nA DrugFreeSG Community Roadshow was held in April 2018 to enhance outreach in the heartlands, targeting parents. Two more will be organised in 2019.\nThese are just some examples of CNB's preventive drug education efforts. We have seen encouraging results. We will need to continue countering the increasingly widespread portrayal in the popular media, of drug consumption as being a socially acceptable activity.",

      "Mr K Shanmugam\n: We have many slides, but this sort of shows you what the trends have been over a period of time in terms of drug use. Anyway, in all the downward blip for the period when people abused Subutex, when you see that, it is probably a fairly smooth curve. There was not a real dip in certain years because people were using Subutex. And then we outlawed that and they went back to other drugs.\nThe number of drug abusers we have in Singapore is relatively low compared with some of the other jurisdictions. For example, the number of opiate abusers in Singapore is less than 30 per 100,000 people. In Portugal, the number is almost 500. In the US, the number is 600, that is, 20 times our number. In Portugal, it is just under 20 times. And the numbers will grow further in the US because of the move towards legalisation in many states.\nIntravenous drug use is not a significant mode of HIV transmission in Singapore. So, if you think of the lives that have been saved, the misery, deprivation, the loss – we have saved a lot of people from that. If you just look at that slide ‒ from something near 7,000 people being arrested per year, to something in the region of 3,000-plus being arrested now. If you take that as 3,000 to 4,000 lives per year over a 20-year period, it is a lot of lives, a lot of people who have been saved from drugs. This result has been possible because we have been tough on drugs.\nAnd we should not ease up. You look at the cases anecdotally. Just this Monday, CNB arrested a trafficker in a drug bust. During the investigations, officers discovered that ‒ and it was a lady ‒ she was caregiver to a toddler. She had left him with two other suspected drug traffickers. Concerned about the toddler’s safety, CNB and Police then moved quickly with operations the very next day to take down two suspects. The young child was rescued and is now with Child Protective Services. How old is the child? One year old. In that one year, the young child had already been abandoned by his mother, who is on the run for drug offences, and being passed around between drug traffickers. These are not isolated cases. In many other countries, these are par for the course. We do not want to get there.\nIn another case, a drug addict father abused his baby daughter ‒ very cruel, regularly biting her. One day, he was furious because he had no money to buy drugs. The baby cried ‒ as babies do ‒ and he shoved her against the wall so hard, her skull fractured. She was 10 months old ‒ not old enough to defend herself. These are the victims of drugs.\nThe activists light candles for traffickers outside Changi Prison. They write emotive stories. They dream up about their lives. But who cares for these very real victims? How many young lives have we saved with our policies? Would you hear a squeak from the activists about these people ‒ the actual victims of burglaries, housebreakings, families torn apart through drugs, the physical violence, the mental abuse, and, by a process of estimation, the number of people who have been saved from that, the shootings and the killings that take place in other countries where drug abuse is prevalent. The 60,000 people who died through opioid abuse do not capture all the deaths in the US. There are many more gangland violence with drugs as the underlying cause ‒ the shootings, guns, weapons.\nWe have another case in Singapore ‒ a 9-year-old boy living with his abusive aunt. He saw her doing drugs. He ran away because he was scared of being beaten again when she was under the influence of drugs. But she found him, hit him, burned him with a lighter, picked him up and dangled him out of a third-storey window.\nOur CNB officers recently came across another abuser ‒ seven months pregnant, still smoking “ice”. She already had a previous miscarriage because of her “ice” habit, but her addiction was so strong. She persisted anyway, at the expense of her unborn, innocent child. And, again, from foreign jurisdictions, you see cases where children are born with addiction in-built and they need and crave for heroin from the time they are born.\nWho speaks for these defenceless victims? As I have said earlier, the self-styled activists refused to talk about how the addiction of hundreds of abusers is fed with each shipment that these traffickers bring in. How many families suffer as a result of drugs?\nOur penalties are severe because we want to deter such offences, not because we take any joy in enforcing them. No one can take any joy in enforcing them.\nOur regional drug situation remains challenging. The region is home to the Golden Triangle, which is the largest methamphetamine market in the world. Trafficking of heroin and methamphetamine in this region alone is estimated to generate over US$32 billion annually. It is a very lucrative business. It is not going to go away. So, let us not kid ourselves.\nInternational criminal syndicates operate in this region, attracted by the profits. Being a major transport and commercial hub makes us susceptible, both as a transit point and as an import market because of the wealth factor.\nIt is beyond our ability to change factors outside of Singapore. What we can do is to try and deter criminals from attempting to bring drugs into Singapore. And we have to be firm in resisting those who try to force their ideologies on us.\nParliamentary Secretary Amrin Amin will elaborate on how we are working with various stakeholders on this.\nThe Chairman\n:",
      "(Mr K Shanmugam)\n: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I thank Mr Christopher de Souza for moving this Motion and the Members for giving their views and supporting generally the very strong stand that we take. This Motion is a timely reminder for us to remain vigilant, continue to be tough on drugs and make this a national priority.\nAs we debate the way forward, what do we do next? Mr Pritam Singh talked about international currents. Others talked about the mood within Singapore, young people. As we assess how we move forward, I think it is useful for Members to understand a little bit about how the history of our fight against drugs evolved and really look at the period between the 1960s and 1980s. In a snapshot, what did we have then? We had high crime rates. We had abusers stealing, committing crimes to feed their addiction. We had traffickers exploiting the abusers' dependence. We had broken families. If I give some numbers, I think Members will be shocked and I will give some numbers in a minute.\nTo tackle this, CNB was set up in 1971. It does not pre-date 1971. We saw it as a menace and we said we had to fight it; which is why in every speech I make, I emphasise it is not a single solution, not just the death penalty. It is a whole suite of factors. CNB was set up, empowered. The legislative framework was put in through the MDA in 1973. And then Operation Ferret was launched to reverse the momentum. You can guess from the name what it meant. So CNB, the Police Force, they coordinated their efforts, flushed out the abusers. If we had not done that, the law and order situation today in Singapore that we take for granted would be very different.\nIn the early 1970s – mark this – we were arresting less than 10 heroin abusers a year. We could have kidded ourselves and believed that that was the true situation. But after we set up CNB and after we started Operation Ferret, by February 1978, 26,000 abusers had been arrested. That is the picture before and after. So, for people outside this House and for the hon Nominated Member of Parliament who advocates a softer approach, suggests that our laws are too tough, remember these figures. When you do not enforce, you get one picture; and 26,000 people by 1978.\nIn the 1980s, we still had more than 8,000 in DRC. In 1993, our DRC recidivism rate was 73%. That is where we were and, today, everyone accepts, even The Economist accepts, that we have the drug situation under control, perhaps the only country to be able to say that openly and directly and backed up by the facts.\nWe set up a committee to improve the drug situation in November 1993 with a comprehensive anti-drug strategy − preventive drug education in the schools, tough laws backed up by tough enforcement, rehabilitation, aftercare. It is a whole context of factors. That is the background. We have had a good run for 20 years but now consider the global situation and how that might impact on us.\nUNODC estimates in 2014 that there are nearly 250 million drug abusers in the world. And 200,000 died from drug-related causes. That probably does not include the type of cases that Mr Christopher de Souza talked about, where people under the influence of drugs caused traffic accidents and killed others. These are people who died as a result of drug abuse − 200,000.\nMr Pritam Singh is right that global conversation is about a softer stance on drugs, seductive arguments using pseudo-science and glamorising drugs, and they do create a challenging environment for us to keep Singapore drug-free.\nIf you look at the evidence, you look at the US, opioid abuse, the prescriptions went up three-fold since 1999, fuelled by people relying on and accepting questionable evidence that these are benign pain remedies. Going into diversions and misuse, thousands get hooked on to it, and then guess what happens? They moved on to heroin. Now, New York Times reported that there were 33,000 deaths per year.\nFor those with bleeding hearts who talk about inmates on death row, I think they should think about these 33,000 deaths. What percentage do you want in Singapore? What about their families, the children? Why not spend some time with them rather than just crying with the people in the death row? This is, as Mr Christopher de Souza pointed out, a trafficker engaging in a crime of cynicism or crime with cynicism for profit. He knows what he is doing, he is coming in for money and there is nothing on the spur about it.\nThe same arguments that were used to try and get opium allowed are now being used for cannabis legislation. The arguments, if you look at them, are evocative but little clinical evidence. There is some suggestion – Mr Pritnam Singh talked about it, others talked about it – about how people are now going into medical marijuana and medical cannabis and so on.\nI said at the United Nations I do not want human rights groups preaching to me about the medical value of cannabis. If a respectable medical association is prepared to tell me that this ought to be prescribed as medicine, we will look at it. What does the American Medical Association say? That there is no proven record for this. There can be no objection to any substance being prescribed by a doctor based on scientific evidence. I think there is every objection to a blanket legislation allowing free use of cannabis or opium on the basis of some questionable medical suggestion which no medical association worth its salt is prepared to back up.\nMr Pritam Singh is right: legalisation around the world is gaining ground. He quoted Malaysia, Thailand and Israel, but my point is, a large majority of Singaporeans stand by what is right, stand by our position. Even internationally, when I went to the UN, we brought along a doctor who had pored through a substantial amount of medical literature on substance abuse, cannabis abuse, in particular, and was prepared to stand up and present that this is the impact cannabis has on your brain structure and it makes you dependent. Stacks of medical evidence.\nScience is always evolving and if science evolves to a different stage, we are practical people and we rely on facts. But, today, this is the science. I thank Mr Pritnam Singh for the strong stand he took in terms of supporting the position we take in Singapore against drugs.\nMr Christopher de Souza pointed out how drug abuse has worsened in Colorado since they legalised cannabis. It is serious. And who is pushing it? The pharma companies are pushing it. Why? It is obvious why. Even when we go to these international conferences, the NGOs which support legalisation come out with brochures which are glitzy, which are very attractive, evocative. They are all financed by the pharma companies. Those who oppose legalisation, those who take a stand similar to Singapore's, if you look at the material, you would not want to look at them again because no one is financing them. There is a huge commercial motive for legalisation and that is driving this in many countries.\nThere are other factors. Many countries have lost the fight. They cannot control domestic drug abuse. So, after having lost tens of thousands of lives, they move to focusing on public health issues, HIV. So, you get an alliance with a commercial interest and countries saying we cannot handle this anymore. They are now saying let us create a new international norm. Well, I do not have a problem if they change their rules; but I do have a problem if they want to change international norms and say every country should follow that. We will not be pressured.\nThat is the international situation; that is the background. What is the local situation? We have some challenges. The first challenge is increased supply. I have said this before, we are near the Golden Triangle, which is the second largest opium source in the world. Afghanistan has become a major producer. In order to get its stuff on to the West, sometimes or quite often, they seem to want to take the road through Southeast Asia.\nOur region is the fastest growing meth market. We are a major transport hub, 200 million people go through our airport, shores, land checkpoints. Because of the wealth factor, our people can pay, therefore, it is an attractive destination, both for transhipment and as a destination source. That is one major challenge.\nThe second major challenge is drug peddling sales online. You can have anonymous transactions, you can have parcels coming in from any part of the world; that creates a challenge.\nWe also face a challenge from new drugs, new psycho-active substances, where people take drugs and mix them with contaminants to lower the costs. We have real chemists who modify pharmaceuticals.\nCNB, for example, in the past two years, has seized more than 3.5 kilogrammes and 4,000 tablets of new psycho-active substances, which have been falsely marketed as both being legal and safe.\nAnother separate challenge is the new attitudes of our young people. There is a certain perception, glamorised through media outside of this country, that drugs are cool and cannabis are non-addictive. If we are not careful, they can become our next generation of abusers. There is a changing profile of abusers. Last year, 40% of those who were arrested were abusers, were less than 30 years old. The mix − the students, professionals, people who are well-educated, good jobs and a new group of Singaporeans trying drugs.\nParents may think it is not their children but, in the past three years, we have picked up 350 students, all levels from Primary school to tertiary and all backgrounds, as well as without a background of substance abuse in the family. Last year, for working professionals, more than 70 professionals, managers, including accountants and engineers. And the drug abusers committed 12% of other crimes. That is another worrying statistic.\nEighty-three percent of those in our prisons are in there either for substance abuse or they have a history of substance abuse even though the particular crime they committed was not related to drugs. So, you can see how much drugs can impact our lives. It destroys you. These are all statistics, facts.\nLet me give you an example – what it does. We call him Edy, a young boy, six years old, both parents were jailed for drugs. He happened to be in the care of another person called Johan. Johan was also a drug abuser, forms an ecosystem, a separate subculture. Johan slapped around Edy, stomped on him repeatedly, on the six-year-old boy, killed him and dumped his body by the Kallang River.\nYou know there are thousands of such cases, not in Singapore but around the world. Most Members might have heard of Noinoi. She had a stepfather, Mohd Johari, abusing cannabis, cough syrups, brought her home as a shield to hide his own abuse, thought that having her there, bringing her with him will prevent detection. She was only two years old. She was crying, he could not take it, he dumped her in a pail and killed her.\nThose who think we should go soft on drugs, on punishment, what is your solution to the thousands of \"Edys\" and \"Noinois\" around the world who are neglected, abused and suffering?\nIf you look at the trend, if I give a summary, you have a new generation of abusers. They are younger, they have different profiles, backgrounds and the situation can again become more troublesome, even if it does not get out of control. Our primary duty must be to protect our society and our people and stand up together as a country.\nMost Members' suggestions are in line with where we want to go. And I agree with Mr Christopher de Souza as well as the others who spoke. We will maintain a tough stance and we will step up. We will review our strategy for the new challenges. It will be targeted. It will differentiate between those who supply and cause harm versus those who are abusers and, where possible, we will employ a data-based, science-based approach.\nOur first line of defence has got to be education, preventive drug education. We have worked for decades with MOE − school talks, lesson plans, so that our young people will understand. A Member mentioned Iceland. Coincidentally, we have also looked at Iceland. Our people are going over to Iceland to look at how they send their messages across, because this is a generation that when you tell them \"do not do this\", they might go and do it. So, you need different approaches and Iceland does seem to have an approach that seems to work, but their problems are different, the scale is different. But we never believe that we have found the ultimate solutions for anything. We will always seek to learn.\nAnd we have to work with parents because the parents are key influencers.\nThe NCADA survey shows that if a parent interacts with the children, they talk to their children, the risks that the child will take drugs is much lower. We have produced a parents' toolkit for that. Young people are also heavily influenced by peer and environmental influence. So, we need to grow a pool of anti-drug advocates amongst their peers, amongst young people's peers. And we need volunteers, we need more individuals, we need more organisations, civil societies, interest groups, businesses. CNB will launch United Against Drugs Coalition later this month and also review the way it puts across messages. We need to mobilise the ground.\nSecond, effective enforcement and tough laws are part of it. Last year, CNB crippled 23 drug syndicates. We will have to increase partnerships with overseas counterparts and we will have to tackle the new online supply menace, as Mr Christopher de Souza and others have mentioned. We will partner ICA, we will partner courier companies, postal companies, and we will move quickly.\nLast year, ICA detected a suspicious parcel and alerted CNB. Within a matter of hours, CNB arrested the intended recipient and seized more than one kilogramme of cannabis. Without that, that one kilogramme would have flowed on to the streets and destroyed more lives.\nAsst Prof Mahdev Mohan talked about the recent acquittals and how it will affect sentencing approach. Keeping our laws effective for deterrence, enforcement is a top priority. We will relook at the comments made in those cases. We have started doing it and will ensure that investigations are conducted thoroughly and impartially. AGC will help us study the Grounds of Decisions on that.\nThe NCADA survey that I referred to also shows a very strong support for our tough laws. People want us to be tougher on those who harm society, those who bring drugs in, those who provide it to others, especially young people, and those who encourage others. We will have to study how we deal with the issue of new psycho-active substances, how we amend the Schedules and what we need to do.\nMembers spoke about the amendments in 2012 to the Mandatory Death Penalty Scheme, in the context of drugs and drug trafficking, and whether they have been helpful. We gave the Courts more discretion, where the trafficker is certified to have helped CNB. It has been helpful. The information provided has contributed to the arrest of almost 90 drug traffickers.\nWhat role does the death penalty play in this? It is an important part in our comprehensive anti-drug regime. And as I have said, part of an overall approach, which will not work on its own but it is a part of an overall set of measures − good judicial process, rule of law, enforcement, tough laws, education, rehabilitation and also DRC and LT.\nRemember, this fight is never won. We are in a difficult situation, being close to drug-producing countries and we have maintained the death penalty as deterrence against trafficking. The quantity of drugs that you need to have in your possession before the death penalty kicks in, presumptions kick in, is enough heroin to supply 180 people for seven days. That is a large amount of drugs. That is a large number of people that you are going to destroy the lives of. And you multiply that by the number of family members.\nWhat is the regional situation? In Malaysia, the registered drug abusers numbered 280,000, as reported by the New Straits Times. In Indonesia, there are 5.9 million drug abusers. What is the nature of the drug trade today? The finance comes from one country, could be manufactured somewhere in some terrace house, somewhere nearby Singapore, and couriers are easily available because they want to make some money.\nDo you believe that the death penalty has deterrent value? If you knew and you are outside of Singapore, you are in Malaysia or Indonesia, and if you knew that the likelihood of being caught is pretty high and that if you are caught with that amount of drugs, that you are most likely to face a death penalty, does that or does not amount to a deterrence? It is a matter of common sense. Why do you think the drug kingpins are not in Singapore? Mr Kok Heng Leun wants me to prove; how do you want me to prove? Go and ask them, \"You will not come into Singapore because of the drug death penalty?\"\nJust remember that trafficking is a cold calculated offence. It is a transaction. The person decides to take a risk with his life, when he comes to Singapore for the sake of money. So, do not tell me they are poor, impecunious and desperate. They made a calculation. They do not mind impacting the lives of 180 people each time.\nMr Kok Heng Leun suggested that we change some of our laws. As we consider how we proceed, why not consider the countries which have adopted your approach? And then compare and contrast. Why not look around? Let us not argue this in a vacuum. See what is happening in countries which have poor enforcements or have legalised drugs. I entirely accept Mr Kok's good intentions and the honesty of the views he has put forward. But frankly, they will lead to the loss of many more lives and they will lead to more tragedy and serious grief for thousands.\nLet me back that up. In the early 1990s, we were arresting between 6,000 and 7,000 people per year. Today, we are arresting between 2,000 and 3,000 per year; over a 20-year period. Even if you take the lower end of those figures, say, 3,000 now and 6,000 then. That is 3,000 less per year, over a period of 20 years and assuming it came down, you are talking about tens of thousands, maybe 40,000, 50,000 lives saved because our enforcement ability has not gone down but we are arresting less people. That means, our drug situation, that demand for it has gone down. Every person not arrested who has not become an abuser is a life saved. So, we have saved maybe 40,000 or 50,000 lives or maybe more.\nIf all things were equal between the 1990s and today, we were arresting 6,000 to 7,000 then, the number should be higher now, because we are wealthier now. The drug production has increased, it has become more of a multinational enterprise, so perhaps, it should have been doubled; we should be arresting 15,000 people or maybe 18,000 people. But we are actually arresting fewer people. We have saved lives. How do you argue against that?\nIf you look at what you have said, first, you said that a person charged for an offence of importation is automatically presumed guilty once the prosecution shows that the accused was merely in possession of the package containing the drugs. Do you really believe that, Mr Kok?\n9.00 pm\nBecause that, as a statement of law, makes no sense. It is an incorrect statement. I do not know whether you wrote the speech, but that is simply not correct.\nYou have also suggested: there is a rule that involuntary statements are inadmissible but we do not really know what happens in the interrogation room; how statements are obtained on witness' testimony; and there is no requirement of recording of any kind. In a drug case, Mr Kok, what needs to be proven? Possession. What the drug is is a matter of scientific evidence; quantity is a matter of scientific evidence. So, what are you suggesting would happen in witness' rooms that might lead to these suggestions that you have implied in your speech?\nI do not know if you know how it works, but the prosecution will have to prove those things. The defence will have to prove that the person did not know what it was, which is usually a defence that is run by many people, and you complained about that as well in your speech, because you say the onus must be on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the ingredients of the offence.\nLet me tell you what the difficulties are in going down that route, because these people come from overseas. The usual variety of defences and let me read out to you a couple. A person was arrested at Woodlands checkpoint. He has got 145 grams of diamorphine. He said he travelled to Kuala Lumpur to look for job opportunities. He was introduced to a man known as \"Uncle\". \"Uncle\" then passed him 10 packets of substances and taped these on to his body. This chap then claimed he asked \"Uncle\" what they were for, but \"Uncle\" showed him three fingers in reply. And he accepted it. He was not aware of the contents, and he came here. Now, you want the prosecution to rebut this? This is why our first Prime Minister, who was a lawyer, knew what the problems would be and reversed the onus of proof. You talked about an \"Uncle\" you met in Kuala Lumpur; you show to the judge that there is such an \"Uncle\" and the \"Uncle\" told you all these things; and what was in your mind? So, again, I do not know whether you drafted this part of the speech or some lawyer drafted it for you, but you got to look at it in context. How does CNB go and prove?\nLet me give you another example. This chap, convicted in 2008. He was asked by one \"Maren\" to deliver items in Singapore. He was told that it was medicine. He was told that it was rare and expensive, that it was wrapped up so that it could not be spoilt by coming into contact with air. And so he went to Johor, met \"Maren\" and brought it over. You want CNB to disprove this? You think it is possible? Or do you think it is fair that the accused should prove it?\nI have a favourite term for defences of this nature. I call them as someone saying it is a shampoo for my pet toad that I got and I brought it into Singapore. So, if that is what you want to say, go and prove it. We are dealing with lives here. The life of a trafficker, yes. But we are also dealing with thousands of Singaporean lives. And the person must get a fair trial. Prosecution must prove what was the substance, how much was it, and possession, and any other evidence they can find. If the person has a defence, it is only fair that he proves it.\nSo far, all these points, while I may disagree with the Member, I can see where he is coming from. But the next point he makes, and let me quote him, he said he would like to \"speak on the humanity of the families of those executed and those who have their loved ones on death row. While we do not see it, the reality is that our criminal punishment, the death penalty, creates a new class of victims in the families of the death row inmates. The family members are innocent people. They found themselves having their loved ones taken away from them. In conversation with a former death row convict who was acquitted by our Court of Appeal, I am struck by the poignancy of how he described the impact of the death penalty on his family.\"\nBut should not our hearts also go out to the victims, the \"Edys\" and the \"Noinois\", the girl who was four months old that Mr Christopher de Souza described, who was in the car locked up while her mother was dazed by drugs? Now, you spoke with someone who was in this situation. I have spoken with many of the victims and their families − a lot of them. And I do not want them to suffer and I do not want more people to suffer as a result of someone making a cynical calculation between his life and getting a few hundred ringgits.\nAnd everyone has families. Victims have families, too. So, for every one person who brings in the drugs, there are several hundred people who suffer. The Prof Michael Hor that Mr Kok Heng Leun quoted was my classmate. And he knows and he has said – in the same conference that Mr Kok referred to – he knows this Government and he does not see that it will change its position on drugs. He knows me.\nThe question then is: do you want to take the risk of dismantling one key part of the deterrence that we have and take a chance? You also say in one part, Mr Kok: is the approach really to put in tougher laws? But at the same time, you also say you accept that the current enforcement is good and the current legal framework is good, other than the death penalty. Again, it appears contradictory. So, I am not sure quite exactly what you mean. And you tell us, of the 1,400 individuals that were placed in 2015 in DRC, 820 had Secondary education, 300 had Primary education, six no education. And you said this gives some indication that it is the inadequacy and gaps in our social and economic institutions, rather than the failure of not having implemented more punitive punishment on drug consumption and drug trafficking that the problem lies.\nWhat are the inadequacy and gaps in our social and economic institutions that lead to this drug abuse? I hope you will clarify exactly what social institutions you are referring to, what economic institutions you are referring to, and what gaps and, causatively, how they relate to the drug problem. I think you should, when you make a statement like that. And I mean causatively. Tell me what the gaps are in the social institutions, which ones, what are the gaps in economic institutions and how do they really lead causatively to these 821 people getting into drugs.\nI told you the backgrounds vary, their education backgrounds vary. There are professionals being picked up. And if you go and look at the backgrounds in other countries, you will see a whole strata of people getting into drug abuse. It is not restricted. You go soft, that is what will happen.\nMr Deputy Speaker\n:",
      "(Ms Sun Xueling)\n: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Members who have spoken. Many of them strongly support Singapore's comprehensive anti-drug strategy. I thank them for their views and their support as we continuously enhance our enforcement efforts, calibrate rehabilitation approaches towards drug abusers and penalise actions which can lead to the spread of drug abuse.\nThe amendments to the MDA are significant and I will like to first touch on the areas which relate to how we are better protecting our children and youths from the dangers of drug abuse.\nMembers have shown strong support for the creation of new offences relating to the exposure of children to drugs and permitting young persons to consume drugs. Mr Christopher de Souza has reminded us about the episodes which happened last year, where a one-year-old boy was rescued from suspected drug traffickers after his care-giver left him in their care; where a four-year-old girl was discovered with her mother, with sachets of methamphetamine; and a three-month-old girl found in a unit with a suspected drug trafficker and drug abuser and preliminary investigations showed that \"ice\" was abused during pregnancy and after the child was born. These are all shocking, sad and true. We need to move quickly to protect our children and prevent tragedies from happening.\nDr Intan asked, whether aside from the abuser, other adults in the household will be implicated if drugs are found within a child's access in the home. CNB will carry out due investigations to establish the ownership of the drugs found in the household.\nAny adult who is in possession of the illicit drugs and knowingly or recklessly leaves the drug exposed, knowing that the child is likely to have access, may be prosecuted for this offence.\nAssoc Prof Theseira asked why we have decided to take this strong stance, given the alternatives and trade-offs.\nIn the cases that Mr Christopher de Souza has cited, this is what our officers see on the ground – young children found in drug dens. They were put in danger, some by their own parents. Others, passed around among caregivers who were either drug abusers or traffickers.\nParaphrasing what Dr Intan said – as adults, we cannot ignore our responsibility towards our children. This is regardless of means or wealth. There is a basic baseline safety that must be upheld and children from all backgrounds are deserving of that same protection.\nAssoc Prof Theseira asked why we decided to create this specific provision in the MDA rather than rely on other Acts. This is because of the specific trends and issues we have observed in the course of drug enforcement.\nThe provisions in the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA), for instance, require that the offender has a custodial relationship with the child. Whereas in the cases we see, there are scenarios such as a parent leaving his child at a friend's house. The friend then abuses drugs, and the child is exposed to the drugs left openly around. Under the CYPA, the friend may not be liable, having no relationship with the child, even though his behaviour has put the child in danger. The MDA hence provides specifically for such permutations of scenarios on the ground and the punishments correspondingly reflect the great capacity for harm that drugs can have, especially on children.\nAssoc Prof Theseira has valid concerns about how this ultimately works towards the welfare of the child.\nThe purpose of section 11B is first and foremost for deterrence, as we do not wish to see innocent children harmed because of the bad choices others make. Nevertheless, please rest assured that our enforcement agencies will also work together with the AGC, MSF and other relevant authorities to assess how to best safeguard the family's welfare.\nTo answer Mr Melvin Yong's and Ms Anthea Ong's question on the age cut-off of 16 years old, section 11B(1) is intended to protect younger children who may not understand the dangers of drugs, and are at higher risk of accidental ingestion.\nThat said, we are concerned about older youths as well, and as Mr Melvin Yong observed, more liberal attitudes, combined with easy access to drugs, means that they may be more likely to give in.\nHence, there is also a section 11(B)(2), which makes it an offence for an adult who permits, or does not take reasonable steps to prevent, a young person under 21 from consuming illicit drugs in the adult's possession.\nAs Mr Faisal Manap has mentioned, education about these offences are important and raising general awareness will help deter such irresponsible actions. We will continue to educate all members of the public through our various preventive drug education platforms.\nNext, to support youth drug abusers and get them to turn over a new leaf, the support of their parents and guardians is critical. On the topic of compulsory counselling for parents/guardians of youth drug abusers who are under CNB's supervision order, Ms Anthea Ong and Dr Intan have asked for further details.\nCNB has worked with social service providers to structure the counselling programme. It consists of a minimum of 25 sessions and lasts up to a year – it will differ for each abuser and this is calibrated to the abuser's, and his family's specific needs. Some sessions will involve only the youth abuser, some only the parents and others are joint sessions. Each family is different, hence the rehabilitation process must have the flexibility to cater to the unique circumstances and needs of these different families.\nSometimes, the counsellors need to counsel the parents privately, to address complex issues affecting their child. As the Minister mentioned earlier, parents/guardians today are already required to attend the counselling sessions, just that some persistently absent themselves. Hence, we have now made clear in the MDA that they have a legal responsibility to attend counselling, which is key to supporting their child's or ward's rehabilitation. Failure to do so will be an offence and we intend for this to come into force by first half of this year.\nDr Chia Shi-Lu and Mr Desmond Choo had asked whether the focus on rehabilitation and the perceived lack of penalties may encourage more young abusers to experiment.\nMr Deputy Speaker, our criminal justice system places a lot of focus on youth rehabilitation because as far as possible, we want to give them a chance to turn over a new leaf, so they do not ruin the rest of their lives. We want to intervene early and effectively, to allow them to continue to study and be with their families where possible.\nI would like to assure Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Mr Desmond Choo that currently, youth abusers already undergo specialised risk-based interventions and this does not change under the amendments.\nFor youth abusers under 21 years old, we have the Youth Enhanced Supervision for low-risk abusers. We have the Community Rehabilitation Centre for moderate-risk abusers and we have the DRC for high-risk abusers. So, it is not that experimentation with drugs is cost-free for the young.\nI also want to emphasise that we are not becoming more permissive about drugs. Drugs come at a high cost to society, and suffering behind every abuser is a family. We have no reason to go soft, and we must not. What we are doing is keeping abreast with new research and developments, to inform and refine our approach, to help us better achieve our aim of reducing overall drug abuse.\nEven as we undertake these new initiatives to better protect our children and youths, we must guard against individuals who undertake contaminated practices, to spread the use of drugs and cause others to abuse drugs. They can harm not only our young but also others.\nOn the introduction of contamination offences, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked whether someone replying to another person's question about manufacturing drugs constitutes a contamination offence.\nThis will depend on the context in which the question is asked, and also the answer given. The proposed section 11(D)(1) requires that the person who provides the information knows, or has reason to believe, that the recipient intends to carry out the manufacturing. It is also not intended to target the provision of information for legitimate purposes or licensed activities, for example, staff in a pharmaceutical company licensed to manufacture medication, providing information to each other as part of the manufacturing process.\nThe Minister has explained earlier that we have provided for defences in the Act and subsidiary legislation will set out the scope of authorised activities.\nThere is also a lot of information on the Internet on carrying out drug activities. While we cannot police the whole Internet, if a person in Singapore disseminates or publishes such information online, without any legitimate purpose, he can be investigated for an offence under section 11(D)(2).\nWe are now building upon the success of past efforts in addressing re-offending. The Taskforce on Drugs was formed in October 2011. Chaired by then-Minister of State for Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs Mr Masagos, one of the key recommendations was the implementation of a structured aftercare regime with more scaffolding for offenders, tighter supervision and enhanced community support.\nThe Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS) was piloted in 2012 and operationalised in July 2014. Under the MAS, higher risk offenders, including Long-Term (LT) inmates go through structured stepdown interventions like compulsory counselling, case management and supervision.\nIt has only been a few years since the MAS was implemented but the results are encouraging. The two-year recidivism rates for LT offenders have come down from 38% for the 2012 release cohort to 27% for the 2015 one.\nEx-inmates have also provided feedback that having counsellors and officers walk with them in their re-integration journey has helped them stay accountable and provided them with a source of support when they struggle with life outside.\nGiven how instrumental post-release support is in helping repeat offenders turn over a new leaf, we are doing more on this front, including increasing post-release supervision for abusers to a maximum of five years.\nMr Desmond Choo asked whether the DRC length is too short and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah also asked how we determine when a person no longer requires supervision. CNB and SPS track the person throughout his detention, and the Community-based Programmes phase as well as the supervision phase.\nWhat Mr Desmond Choo mentioned are rough indicative ranges but each individual is different – so their own risk and progress will determine the length of each phase. If the person shows very poor progress, he may be detained for up to four years in DRC for rehabilitation, coupled with five years of supervision. Regular reviews are done to assess rehabilitation progress. It is a step-down approach. As he shows improvement and stays clean, he can be considered for progressively lower frequencies of urine/hair testing until he is assessed suitable for release from his supervision.\nThe journey is difficult; and ultimately, the ability of the person to stay clean depends on his own resolve. But we are doing more to provide support where we can. In that respect, Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Murali, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Joan Pereira have asked whether there is adequate support and training for counsellors.\nAll of SPS' correctional rehabilitation specialists possess qualifications in relevant disciplines and SPS also provides on-the-job training. It is a very meaningful, rewarding but challenging calling. Thus, there are also senior staff there to provide guidance and help them avoid burnout. SPS also has an in-house team of psychologists that they can turn to, for mental or emotional support. The SPS also collaborated with the Social Service Institute to introduce training modules last year that will help build up capabilities of case managers and counsellors.\nAs several Members have noted, all these rehabilitation initiatives can be resource-intensive but we use digital technology to help, where possible, and the app and video-conferencing initiatives, mentioned by Mr Mohamed Irshad will go a long way to benefiting inmates, including drug offenders.\nMr Christopher de Souza and Mr Louis Ng provided other good suggestions for inmates such as having more open visits, providing them with more workbooks and healthy physical activities, and providing them with more support during the initial incarceration phase.\nThese are some of the good practices SPS has already put in place and they will continue to work on them.\nMr Melvin Yong also spoke about early interventions for abusers’ families. We recognise the importance of families to the rehabilitation process, hence SPS will be restructuring family programmes in the prisons and working with MSF to identify inmates’ family needs early, provide intervention, and increase family involvement in inmate rehabilitation.\nWe will also continue working with community partners to ensure that abusers’ children who are at-risk are referred to the proper channels for assistance and counselling where required. Mr Deputy Speaker, in Chinese, please.\n(\nIn Mandarin\n)\n:"

In schools, students learn about Singapore's laws and regulations concerning illegal substances, their harmful consequences and new developments to be mindful of.

Schools share resources with parents to raise awareness of the consequences of substance abuse and strategies to support a substance-free lifestyle.\nMOE also works closely with the Central Narcotics Bureau and the Health Promotion Board on preventive education and enforcement. This includes collaborations to raise awareness among students, parents and social service agencies of the illegality and harms of any new or emerging substances.

It is also not intended to target the provision of information for legitimate purposes or licensed activities, for example, staff in a pharmaceutical company licensed to manufacture medication, providing information to each other as part of the manufacturing process.\nThe Minister has explained earlier that we have provided for defences in the Act and subsidiary legislation will set out the scope of authorised activities.\nThere is also a lot of information on the Internet on carrying out drug activities. While we cannot police the whole Internet, if a person in Singapore disseminates or publishes such information online, without any legitimate purpose, he can be investigated for an offence under section 11(D)(2).\nWe are now building upon the success of past efforts in addressing re-offending. The Taskforce on Drugs was formed in October 2011. Chaired by then-Minister of State for Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs Mr Masagos, one of the key recommendations was the implementation of a structured aftercare regime with more scaffolding for offenders, tighter supervision and enhanced community support.\nThe Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS) was piloted in 2012 and operationalised in July 2014. Under the MAS, higher risk offenders, including Long-Term (LT) inmates go through structured stepdown interventions like compulsory counselling, case management and supervision.\nIt has only been a few years since the MAS was implemented but the results are encouraging. The two-year recidivism rates for LT offenders have come down from 38% for the 2012 release cohort to 27% for the 2015 one.\nEx-inmates have also provided feedback that having counsellors and officers walk with them in their re-integration journey has helped them stay accountable and provided them with a source of support when they struggle with life outside.\nGiven how instrumental post-release support is in helping repeat offenders turn over a new leaf, we are doing more on this front, including increasing post-release supervision for abusers to a maximum of five years.\nMr Desmond Choo asked whether the DRC length is too short and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah also asked how we determine when a person no longer requires supervision. CNB and SPS track the person throughout his detention, and the Community-based Programmes phase as well as the supervision phase.\nWhat Mr Desmond Choo mentioned are rough indicative ranges but each individual is different – so their own risk and progress will determine the length of each phase. If the person shows very poor progress, he may be detained for up to four years in DRC for rehabilitation, coupled with five years of supervision. Regular reviews are done to assess rehabilitation progress. It is a step-down approach. As he shows improvement and stays clean, he can be considered for progressively lower frequencies of urine/hair testing until he is assessed suitable for release from his supervision.\nThe journey is difficult; and ultimately, the ability of the person to stay clean depends on his own resolve. But we are doing more to provide support where we can. In that respect, Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Murali, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Ms Joan Pereira have asked whether there is adequate support and training for counsellors.\nAll of SPS' correctional rehabilitation specialists possess qualifications in relevant disciplines and SPS also provides on-the-job training. It is a very meaningful, rewarding but challenging calling. Thus, there are also senior staff there to provide guidance and help them avoid burnout. SPS also has an in-house team of psychologists that they can turn to, for mental or emotional support. The SPS also collaborated with the Social Service Institute to introduce training modules last year that will help build up capabilities of case managers and counsellors.\nAs several Members have noted, all these rehabilitation initiatives can be resource-intensive but we use digital technology to help, where possible, and the app and video-conferencing initiatives, mentioned by Mr Mohamed Irshad will go a long way to benefiting inmates, including drug offenders.\nMr Christopher de Souza and Mr Louis Ng provided other good suggestions for inmates such as having more open visits, providing them with more workbooks and healthy physical activities, and providing them with more support during the initial incarceration phase.\nThese are some of the good practices SPS has already put in place and they will continue to work on them.\nMr Melvin Yong also spoke about early interventions for abusers’ families. We recognise the importance of families to the rehabilitation process, hence SPS will be restructuring family programmes in the prisons and working with MSF to identify inmates’ family needs early, provide intervention, and increase family involvement in inmate rehabilitation.\nWe will also continue working with community partners to ensure that abusers’ children who are at-risk are referred to the proper channels for assistance and counselling where required. Mr Deputy Speaker, in Chinese, please.\n(\nIn Mandarin\n)\n:",

Mr Christopher de Souza spoke about stemming the supply and demand of drugs. Keeping Singapore drug-free is a key priority for MHA. This requires a combination of tough laws, effective enforcement and preventive education.\nThe Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has kept up enforcement efforts. Last year, CNB dismantled 23 drug syndicates, and conducted 19 islandwide operations targeting drug traffickers and abusers.

Close to two-thirds, or 64%, of new abusers arrested were under 30 years old. This is very worrying and there are foreign celebrities who glamourise drug use and they falsely advocate drugs as harmless and “cool”. Our youths must not be fooled.\nMinister earlier mentioned about Portuguese campaign − \"Say no to second-hand syringes\". In Singapore, we have a different campaign. We promote a drug-free life. We advocate a life free from addiction and we encourage our youths to enjoy life to the fullest and make the best of life's opportunities. Be yourself. Hashtag.

      "Mr Gan Kim Yong\n: While there is no formal inter-ministerial committee to oversee the efforts to educate smokers on smoking hazards, MOH works closely with relevant government agencies and educational institutions to educate Singaporeans on the health risks of tobacco use and to help smokers quit smoking.\nFor example, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) works closely with the Ministry of Education and Institutes of Higher Learning to incorporate anti-tobacco messages into the schools' curriculum and co-curricular activities. This is to raise awareness about the benefits of leading a tobacco-free lifestyle and to inform youths on the harms of tobacco smoking. In addition, Student Health Advisors are deployed to some schools to provide support and counselling to students on health issues, including smoking cessation counselling. HPB also organises interactive programmes, such as skits and workshops to discourage experimentation with tobacco products and teach students ways to refuse offers to smoke. Our outreach efforts have reached out to about 50,000 students in 2016.\nHPB launched the \"I Quit\" programme in 2011, and worked with People's Association and employers to organise roadshows at community events and workplaces to encourage smokers to sign-up for the I Quit 28-Day Countdown smoking cessation programme. HPB also works closely with the Ministry of Defence on smoking cessation workshops to educate SAF servicemen on the harmful effects of smoking and encourage them to quit smoking. Smokers can call HPB's QuitLine or access online resources, such as the HPB HealthHub portal, for additional support to quit smoking. In 2016, these programmes reached more than 16,000 smokers.\nIn addition, MOH has mandated graphic health warnings on the harms of smoking on tobacco product packaging since 2004. These are revised on a regular basis to ensure their relevance.\nWe will continue to press on with anti-smoking public educational efforts, and collaborate with the various agencies in this area where necessary."

      "Mr Christopher de Souza\n: Sir, I would like to thank the 11 Members, including the Minister for Home Affairs, for speaking on this Motion and for their support. What they have shared is insightful and appreciated.\nAs Dr Tan Wu Meng has expressed, \"policy choices… set the tone for decades… and shape the lives of a generation.\" We have to stay vigilant for the sake of those who fall prey to harmful drugs and their families. It is important that the laws send a strong signal to those thinking of trafficking that it is not worth the transaction. As Minister Shanmugam has highlighted − this is a battle − it is regional and it is organised. That is the nature of what we are facing. As Ms Tin Pei Ling has shared, stiff penalties are not something anyone would wish to see applied and yet they are necessary, necessary for deterrence.\nMr Vikram Nair and Mr Alex Yam touched on the importance of our laws which deter the supply of drugs. While they may differ on how the laws should be carried out, there is something in common that binds − the need to ensure that our drug supply laws are relevant enough to stem the supply of drugs. To that end, I had suggested a regular review of the Misuse of Drugs Act.\nMy first suggestion is to calibrate the punishment of drug trafficking to take into account the harmfulness of cocktailed drugs. Some contaminants increase potency and lower the cost to produce. The consequences of a cocktailed drug can be more devastating to the drug user.\nSecondly, as Mr Alex Yam and Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar's points illustrate, it is important that our laws are able to deal effectively with synthetic drugs. It is for this reason that I suggested that the First Schedule be flexible enough to deal with the influx of new psycho-active substances and that the move from the Fifth Schedule to the First Schedule be prompt enough to frame a drug trafficking charge. This does not just restrict but also deter the supply of such drugs before they can gain a sizeable demand.\nThirdly, Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan and Mr Alex Yam highlighted the need to stem the \"route\" of drugs being shipped in through the Internet. This is why I proposed that a new offence be created with an enhanced punishment regime to tackle trafficking and recruiting through the Internet.\nTechnology transcends geographical boundaries and, in this instance, it has turned dark. Through the Dark Net, drugs have become accessible. In a BBC documentary, a journalist ordered drugs online. It was an eBay-like user experience, it was in quick order processing time of mere hours and there was a delivery in ordinary-looking packages containing the drugs.\nOur region is not spared. This is a headline from the New Straits Times. It reads: \"Drug pushers using WhatsApp, WeChat to sell, recruit school kids\". This was dated just two months ago, 2 February 2017. We must be wary that social media can turn into a Trojan horse if left unwatched.\nBesides the Internet component, the other suggestion is the need to tackle the upward trend of drug abuse among those under 30. This trend has been raised by Ms Tin Pei Ling. As Dr Intan Mokhtar has highlighted through her stories, this is, indeed, a worrying trend. Look at the top graph. Please look at the top of the graph. The top bright blue line snaking out at the top, way above the rest − that is what we should be concerned about. That line shows that the number of drug abusers arrested from between 20 and 29 years of age hit the 1,000 mark and over in 2015 and 2016. This is the situation we are dealing with. We need to do something about it.\nTo this end, the thrust of my third to sixth suggestions was to introduce new provisions in the Misuse of Drugs Act to deter trafficking and recruitment via the Internet, especially among those under 30 years of age.\nOur strong deterrent laws garnered support from Mr Vikram Nair, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin, Mr Alex Yam and Dr Tan Wu Meng. They agreed that strong deterrent laws continue to be important and have played an important part in Singapore's relative success. While they look at the need for deterrent laws to the drug abuser to stay away from drugs, they also recognised the need to rehabilitate, reintegrate and restore the drug abuser into society.\nAs Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin puts it quite nicely, we are holding \"both punitive justice and restorative mercy in tension\", \"a strong anti-drug stance against the traffickers paired with an equally strong pro-rehabilitation stance for the addicts.\"\nAn integral part and an important part is the family − this is because the family and the children suffer, too, when the drug abuser is put into incarceration for extended periods of time. As Ms Kuik has put it, \"The last thing we want is for kids to grow up motherless or fatherless which in turn increases the next generation's risk of falling into similar patterns of drug abuse and incarceration.\"\nMr Louis Ng expressed the importance of reaching out to the family within the first week.\nAn important initiative, as mentioned by Minister Shanmugam, is the Yellow Ribbon Community Project. In the second phase of the project, grassroots volunteers reach out to the new inmates' families by visiting them and grafting them into the community through events. They also connect them with much-needed resources and practical support. Accountability and effectiveness are enhanced through regular communication and updates.\nMr Louis Ng had also an interesting insight to share: \"The drug consumption might be the symptom of a problem… The lack of strong family bonds might [be] the reason they consumed drugs in the first place.\"\nSupplementing the hon Member's point, I would like to share one example of a type of family therapy that addresses these problems. There is a family therapy intervention exercise described in Friedman and Granick's book entitled Family Therapy for Adolescent Drug Abuse. It seeks to restructure the maladaptive aspects of the family system, such as, crisis management, guilt and the burden of redemption and, thereafter establish a method for controlling or eliminating substance abuse. It also includes education about the effects and dependence process of drug use.\nMr Louis Ng and Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin have given moving examples of how bonding with children may be the best motivation for rehabilitation. One, in particular, that stood out for me is inmate mothers recording bedtime stories for their children. This just shows how a small gesture can go a long way. We should move beyond increased visitation time and increase such precious bonding opportunities to form a cornerstone of rehabilitation.\nAsst Prof Mahdev Mohan has highlighted the need for rehabilitation. Perhaps something that could be looked into, alongside what Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin raised on art-based rehabilitative programmes, is reconditioning, the over-writing of old thought patterns by new ones.\nOne example is Healing Broken Circles in Ohio, which does rehabilitation programmes in an incarceration setting. \"Offered in a safe environment where participants feel they belong, learn concepts [and] master skills\", its strength-based programmes provide participants healthy ways of expressing themselves, through art and courses of higher thinking and higher learning. These are important qualities to overcome the hurdles of reintegration. Again, we need not be so liberal in terms of the freedom provided, but it is nonetheless worth a study whether their programmes can fit into an incarceration model like DRC.\nPositive peer support can be facilitated. Ms Tin Pei Ling, Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin and Nominated Member of Parliament Mr Kok Heng Leun touched on the importance of accountability even through art − a key component, in my opinion, to good peer support and rehabilitation.\nOne example is Japan's Drug Addiction Rehabilitation Centre (DARC). It is staffed mostly by those who have recovered from drug dependence. It was reported in 2006 that three quarters of the previous users maintain sobriety. One of the reasons for the high rating from the users is \"the companionship from recovered addicts and flexible frameworks to enhance drug addicts' motivation to recover.\" This is just one example of how positive peer support can be facilitated.\nThe message to the former drug addict should be, \"We want you to come back into the community\". As Mr Alex Yam movingly shared, \"the most important reassurance to recovering addicts is that they have a place at the table, that they are not abandoned by society.\"\nTo have a place at the table, the former inmate must receive post-release support. A good local initiative is Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association's anonymous live chat service on its talk2sana online portal launched just last month. This looks to be widely accessible, yet personalised. More such ground-up initiatives can be encouraged.\nOn the third point of the Motion, culture, there was broad support to resist pro-illicit-drug propaganda. Mr Pritam Singh emphasised the need for preventive education to deter the pro-drug culture from embedding itself here. I thank Mr Singh for his contribution to the debate. It is significant that we have bipartisan support for this important, collective battle against a pro-drug culture.\nDr Intan Mokhtar, when we heard her talk about her son and what he faces in school, I was reminded again of how close to home this problem of drugs is. It must not have been easy to share, but thank you for sharing.\nTo add on to Dr Intan's point on the need to reach out to students and post-Secondary institutions, I think that it is important that students be taught the host of ills about drugs from a young age, but not just why they should stay away from drugs but also how to stay away from drugs.\nThe National Council Against Drug Abuse Youth Perception Survey in 2013 showed that while \"96.5% of youths whose parents had spoken to them about drugs and drug abuse reported that those conversations have deterred them from taking drugs\", only \"less than half of the youths had conversations with their parents on drugs and drug abuse.\"\nThis battle for the mindshare of young Singaporeans is not something we can under-estimate. As Dr Intan Mokhtar's account of her son has well illustrated, this battle is not far off. We need to be vigilant. Parents need to know that: (a) it is a matter that they should be concerned about and (b) that they matter − that parents matter.\nMr Vikram Nair raised an important query whether the amendments in 2012 have caused a perception in the minds of potential drug traffickers that we have softened our stance. It is a valid query. Will MHA study this? And if, indeed, MHA forms the view that the discretionary punishment mechanism has caused an increase in drug trafficking, we should seriously consider removing that discretionary mechanism and reverting back to the mandatory punishment regime. Given the consequences of drug trafficking to innocent victims in society, it is a legitimate query and needs to be responded to.\nWithin this Motion, Nominated Member Mr Kok Heng Leun has questioned capital punishment. As mover of the Motion, I am prepared to tell Mr Kok what I believe in and why.\nFirstly, I am not here baying for blood. Nobody here cheers the idea of putting another person to death. Nobody here wants to have to pronounce the death penalty on another person. But I also care about the victims of drug trafficking. We must also speak up for the innocent children of addicts who endure weeks, months, years of emotional neglect, physical neglect and abuse. I also care for the addicts who suffer slow and lingering deaths and the victims of violent drug-related crimes. Introducing people to drugs through drug trafficking results in slow and agonising deaths for them and years of pain for their families.\nIn response to the Nominated Member, let me provide an explanation on practical grounds first. Then, I will explain the principle and justifications following that. I do not disrespect the Nominated Member's view. It is just that I do not agree with them.\nFirst, the practical explanation. Any discussion on capital punishment must start with a query whether our legal system offers the environment needed to ensure that capital punishment does deter future drug trafficking crimes or, at least, reduces the incidence of such future crimes. No system is perfect. But I believe our system does have the attributes required to ensure that punishments meted out by the Courts, including capital punishment, do deter future crime.\nWhy do I say this? It is because we are a society governed by the rule of law. What does this mean? Firstly, we have an effective judicial service and an efficient one. Second, the investigative body in the form of the Singapore Police Force and the Central Narcotics Bureau is impartial and efficient. In short, investigations are carried out professionally.\nWith regard to the insightful point raised by Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan, I would respond that where the investigations do not meet the standards required by the Courts to meet the burden of proof, then the conviction is not meted out. Rather, an acquittal is given. This was so in the recent case of Harven vs Public Prosecutor decided just two weeks ago. Two Judges in the Court of Appeal found the burden of proof was not met − Justice Chao Hick Tin delivering the majority decision; Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon concurring. One judge, Justice Tay Yong Kwang found it was met. This is the merit of our system − an independent assessment of the facts by three independent judges. The result, an acquittal.\nDeveloping the ethos behind Asst Prof Mahdev's points, I am open to further safeguards, such as having three judges sit at first instance for capital trials and five judges sitting in the Court of Appeal for all capital appeals. That would make the process even more thorough for the sake of the trafficker. And I hope the suggestion will be considered.\nThird, within that rubric of rule of law, the potential offender, in this case, the potential drug trafficker, knows that if he is caught in Singapore, the law will be applied against him. He cannot bribe or manoeuvre out of the reach of the law. So, if the case is proven against him, he will receive the relevant sentence. In that sense, the law is predictable.\nFourthly, when punishments are meted out, they are publicised so the potential drug trafficker knows that if he commits a certain crime, he will be punished. That awareness is important to deter future crime, or diminish the incidence of future crime.\nThe Singapore legal system is possessed with all of these attributes and so it is a conducive environment for the sentencing rationale of deterrence to operate in. Furthermore, drug trafficking is a rational crime. The drug trafficker weighs profit to himself compared to punishment. And because of the attributes of our legal system, he knows that he will receive the punishment if he is caught and the case is proven against him.\nIt is not in every country in the world that you have all those positive attributes at play within a legal system and we must work hard to keep those positive attributes.\nSo, my practical conclusion is that capital punishment can and does deter future crime in Singapore. It is a system that works well now and, until and unless a better and more effective system can be set up, I say we keep the present raft of muscular laws. If we take it away, there is every chance that the deterrence against future crimes will be removed or diminished. I cannot speak for other countries. But as for Singapore, in my view, it deters.\nLet me now move on to the explanation based on principle. I first had to analyse the issue of capital punishment as a judicial officer assisting the Court of Appeal and as a prosecutor in the Attorney-General's Chambers when I first started legal practice. I had to deal with capital cases. They were never easy cases. We had to search our minds; we had to search our inner selves, to do what was right by society and the individual alleged offender.\nIn the AG's Chambers, I remember prosecuting a capital case. The offender had murdered his landlord. Why? Because he wanted to steal money from his landlord to fuel his drug addiction. Drugs and drug trafficking destroy lives. Let us be completely clear about that. In this case, drug trafficking supplied a man with drugs and he eventually killed, murdered to fuel his addiction. He received capital punishment. So, I have been there. I knew that the consequences of a case proven will lead to capital punishment. It is never easy but it is required.\nAs a judicial officer, I worked closely with the Court of Appeal, then-Chief Justice Yong Pung How and Judge of Appeal Chao Hick Tin. Capital appeals would go up for hearing and I would support the judges by analysing the arguments on appeal with them. I remember one case clearly where the capital punishment decision was reversed and the offender was given 10 years' imprisonment. In other cases, capital punishment was upheld. In each instance, all those individuals, all those involved, had to think deeply about what was right in each case.\nFrom those experiences, I now know the importance of what we discuss and debate in this House when we make laws for our land. I am convinced that we should not remove a needed legal weapon, in the form of capital punishment, in our fight against drug trafficking. To remove it, in my view, would be to harm even more innocent victims.\nFifteen milligrammes of diamorphine sustain 180 abusers for a week. Assuming four members per addict, that is 900 people affected. As regards my example of 900 people, for how long are they affected? If the drug is highly addictive, that addict would be on it for years, psychologically killing himself and his family, slowly, over weeks, months, years. Nine hundred people. That is equivalent to 30 platoons.\nThe real question we have to ask ourselves today is whether we, as a society, want to risk a potential increase in the supply of life-destroying drugs into Singapore, higher number of addicts, higher number of innocent families destroyed if we remove capital punishment for drug trafficking.\nProtecting the hard, muscular position against drug trafficking protects even more innocent victims plunging into the horrendous clutches of addiction. As Deputy Prime Minister Teo mentioned in the 2012 Misuse of Drugs Amendment (MDA) debate, and I quote, \"We know that the mandatory death penalty has a deterrent effect because drug traffickers deliberately try to keep the amounts they carry to below the capital punishment threshold.\" So, for these principled reasons, in addition to the practical reasons that I have laid out, I do not think it wise, for the sake of the innocent victims, to go soft against traffickers.\nI would also like to ask a few questions. What if drugs were offered to your children in the playground, any of our children in the playground? What if drugs were offered to your or our children in school? Once they consume them, there is every chance their health, their mental well-being, their futures will be destroyed.\nHow many of us have actually seen a drug addict, met with a drug addict? I have. I have visited the DRC on more than one occasion and seen addicts desperately trying to overcome addiction.\nIn the DRC, one addict shared with me that he started consuming drugs when he was 13 years of age. Compassion for the trafficker who trafficked to him − a 13-year-old? He was nearly 20 years old when we spoke. You want to have compassion against a trafficker who trafficks to potentially 13-year-olds?\nWhen I studied in England and when I took a train from King's Cross, St Pancras, I saw a drug addict on the sidewalk. Her fingers were bitten through. Flesh was present where her fingernails should have been. I saw her offering herself as a prostitute so she could fuel her drug addiction. It left a deep impression on me to see a life of promise so devastated by drugs.\nIn the constituency I serve, in Singapore, just on Friday night, I met a former drug addict. He came to my MPS. He wants to stay off drugs and pass his urine test. He showed me a photo of himself in his youth, full of promise and health. He now looks a totally different picture − tired, worn.\nSo, you want to have compassion? Yes, compassion for society, compassion for innocent children of addicts, compassion for families.\nIn closing, Sir, drug trafficking is a coldly calculated crime. Tough laws today save lives. Loosen the laws, multitudes of innocent families will suffer. What we debate today is a key decision. What we must hold today is a crucial line − tough laws against drug traffickers; investing in the rehabilitation of drug addicts and preventing a drug-tolerant culture from being established in Singapore. I trust and hope that the House will hold, protect and defend that line today. [\nApplause.\n]\n[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]\n[(proc text) Resolved, \"That this House strengthens the fight against drugs by reaffirming Singapore's strong anti-drug stance and calls on the Government to continue (a) applying tough laws to deter the trafficking of drugs into Singapore; (b) investing in the rehabilitation of drug addicts; and (c) preventing a drug-tolerant culture from being established in Singapore.\" (proc text)]\nMr Deputy Speaker\n:",
      "(Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]\nThis outreach, engagement and targeted public education against drug use and abuse should also be done concurrently with the fight against smoking. To me, the addiction to smoking and drug use is one and the same, and should be done in tandem, since the smoking habit seems to create a propensity towards smoking or taking drugs as well. In addition, I hope CNB and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) can find ways to curb online peddling of drugs more effectively and take tougher enforcement actions on those who are buying drugs online. Never mind that the amount of drugs is small, and never mind that the perpetrators are committing it for the first time, but that they are young. The message must be clear. We do not tolerate drug trafficking and use. At this point, Deputy Speaker, Sir, please allow me to continue in Malay.\n(\nIn Malay\n)\n:\n[\nPlease refer to\nVernacular Speech\n.]\nThe war on drugs is a joint effort by all of us. We need pervasive approaches so as to reach out to and educate our young on the damaging and irreversible effects of both smoking and drug use. Support and assistance from influential personalities and positive role models that our young look up to, strengthen this approach. I understand that local personalities, such as Taufik Batisah and Irfan Fandi, have joined in this fight against drug abuse by offering their time and energy. I look forward to more support from such personalities and positive role models for our young.\nAt the same time, support from home is also important in shaping positive mindsets among our youths in this fight against drug abuse. We need parents to be positive role models for their children − not just by advising them to stay drug-free or smoke-free − but to also role model positive behaviour and healthy lifestyles, free from addiction of any sort.\nThis reminds me of one of my residents. Ms Lydia is still relatively young, barely 40 years old. But each time I met her, she looked haggard and worried, as though she was over 50 years old. Her husband is incarcerated because of drug abuse even though he is already in his 50s. And this is not the first time he had been in prison because of drugs. They have three children − two studying in primary school and one who is three years old.\nThroughout the time Ms Lydia is married to her husband, she did not work and depended on him for financial support. With her husband's recent incarceration, Ms Lydia finds herself with no source of income. We tried our best to help her by providing her with temporary financial assistance. At the same time, we also helped Ms Lydia find part-time work and get a place for her youngest child in a childcare centre so that Ms Lydia can work. Although Ms Lydia is a strong woman who remains undaunted, the social and emotional impact on her and her children, who are now unable to see their father, is quite deep and cannot be easily forgotten. Their family relationship has definitely been affected.\nSupport from the family is much needed, not just when our children or family member have succumbed to drug addiction or smoking, but even before they become a slave to addiction. Developing positive habits and a healthy lifestyle − such as doing sports as a family, spending time on a common hobby with family members and close friends, or by volunteering and doing meaningful work for our community − will help each and every one of us to keep addiction at bay.\n(\nIn English\n): I must admit that the drug scourge in Singapore is not isolated or that only our local agencies have to step up in terms of outreach, education and enforcement. The drug scourge is certainly a global one.\nWhat is equally worrying is the callous claims by some pro-cannabis and pro-marijuana proponents that small amounts of cannabis use is perfectly alright, or that there are medical conditions, such as glaucoma or Parkinson's disease, that can be managed through daily doses of cannabis or marijuana or ganga, whatever name it is known as. We would also need the help of medical professionals and research experts to verify such claims and, more importantly, to curb the incorrect perception that small doses of drug use on a daily basis are perfectly fine.\nSir, the drug situation is far from rosy and the fight against drug use and abuse is far from over. We would need all parties to come together to do this to help ourselves and our future generations − parents, schools, the Government, popular personalities − all have important roles to play. We need to do this together.\nGetting rid of an addiction is certainly not easy. It takes a lot of courage, discipline and inner strength and, of course, support from our loved ones. But it is not impossible.\nWhen it comes to addiction: \"I can choose to let it define me; confine me; outshine me; or I can choose to move on and leave it behind me.\" Thank you, Sir. I support the Motion.",
      "(Mr Amrin Amin)\n: Mdm Chair, I thank Members for their support for the Home Team's work, and I will speak on two areas: first, the scourge of drugs; and the second, the rehabilitation and re-integration of ex-offenders.\nMr Christopher de Souza asked about our drug situation and the strategies to combat this trend. The overall drug abuse situation in Singapore is under control. In 2016, there was a 3% drop in the number of drug abusers arrested compared to 2015, but there are areas of concern. Close to two-thirds of the new drug abusers arrested were below the age of 30, and we are also seeing more cases of students abusing drugs. Therefore, we cannot take our foot off the pedal in the fight against drugs.\nEven with our tough drug laws and active enforcement, we remain vulnerable to the global and regional drug trade. Minister Shanmugam highlighted the situation in the Golden Triangle, as well as the cross-border drug syndicate activities. We must continue to strengthen our enforcement efforts and regional cooperation. CNB works closely with its foreign partners to target syndicates which attempt to supply drugs to Singapore. For example, last December, CNB and the Malaysian Narcotics Crime Investigation Department (NCID) coordinated operations to successfully nab an elusive Malaysian and his associates, who were supplying a sizeable amount of drugs into Singapore.\nAt the same time, we need to reduce demand and step up preventive drug education so that Singaporeans know the dangers of drugs.\nDr Tan Wu Meng highlighted the growing movement overseas to sugar-coat the drug problem. Our youths are not immune from this influence. And on the Internet, our youths see drugs being glamourised. They read about the legalisation of cannabis overseas, and they hear that drugs like cannabis are less harmful and addictive. But this is not true.\nA review conducted by experts at Singapore's Institute of Mental Health found that cannabis is both harmful and addictive, and chronic exposure to cannabis during adolescence is linked to lower IQ and possibly irreversible decline in cognitive performance, lasting into adulthood.\nThe World Health Organization has also compiled research which found that regular cannabis users were more likely to take other drugs like heroin and cocaine.\nTo better engage youths and extend the outreach, CNB has developed a multi-pronged strategy.\nFirst, CNB has been increasing their social media presence, and they have produced videos to convey accurate information on harms of drugs. These are shared online, as well as during drug prevention talks and roadshows.\nSecond, CNB is piloting a new initiative to establish positive \"influencers\" in peer circles. Youths from ITEs, Polytechnics and Universities have signed up for the pilot of an Anti-Drug Advocate (ADA) Programme. These youths will learn about the harmful effects of drugs and Singapore's drug policies. They will visit Halfway Houses and drug rehabilitation centres (DRCs), hearing first-hand accounts from ex-abusers on how hard it is to kick the drug habit. These youths will see what is really at stake if they try drugs. We hope the experience will encourage them to start their own initiatives to spread the anti-drug message to their friends.\nWe need more people to step forward to spread the anti-drug message. Prevention is our first line of defence, and a key part of the battle is won if we keep our people away from drugs.\nHowever, when someone starts to abuse drugs, we must help them to stop. And it is vital that we curb the vicious cycle of re-offending and prevent the spread of drug to non-abusers.\nLast year, CNB arrested a man for drug trafficking. He mixed with bad company, picked up drugs, and never successfully quit. What happened next was worse, he taught his two young sons, aged 19 and 20, to smoke \"ice\". He got them addicted and even supplied their habit.\nWe share Dr Tan Wu Meng's concern on the impact of drug abuse on the family. If we do not succeed rehabilitating offenders, their families including their children may end up becoming victims or offenders. Curbing inter-generational offending starts up-stream, and this applies to both drug abuse and crime. This is an area which we are working with other agencies to better understand and tackle.\nThe rehabilitation process starts upon admission. Inmates are assessed for their risk of re-offending and severity of drug abuse, and depending on risk levels, inmates undergo different programmes which address criminal thinking and addiction issues. They also undergo family support programmes, religious programmes and skills training.\nTo ease their transition back into the community, they can later be emplaced in a Halfway House or on home detention. Under the Day Release Scheme introduced last year, first-time lower risk inmates can also go out to work and study during the day. We hope these measures help inmates better reintegrate into society.\nMr Louis Ng asked about the role of family support in rehabilitation. Indeed, this is one of the key factors that motivate ex-offenders to rebuild their lives and to keep themselves away from re-offending.\nSingapore Prison Service (SPS) partners with Fei Yue Family Services and Lakeside Family Services to provide structured family programmes for inmates −workshops to help better understand the impact of their crimes on their families and build their parenting and communication skills.\nThe Prison Service also works with community partners like the Salvation Army to conduct family sessions in prison. During these sessions, family members are allowed to enter Prison to spend time with the inmates, and they are designed to encourage bonding between inmates and their children, and they serve as powerful reminders to inmates that they need to turn their lives around. These family sessions are also held during special occasions, such as Mothers' Day, Fathers' Day, and Children's Day.\nOther than helping the inmate, Singapore Prison Service also helps their families. The grassroots-led Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) was established to help the families and children of inmates cope, by connecting them to the national social support networks. YRCP has assisted more than 5,000 families. We recognise that family ties are vital to the inmates' rehabilitation and family support is especially important after the inmates' release, and thus, the community's long-term involvement is vital to ensure continuity in these efforts.\nMadam, I understand that my time on the clock has run out. Can I proceed to finish up my answer —”\nThe Chairman\n:"

      "(Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)\n: Mdm Chair, I will now speak on the drug situation in Singapore, road safety and the Home Team's efforts in community partnerships.\nFirst, an update on the overall drug situation, which Mr Edwin Tong asked about. The international and regional drug situation continues to be challenging, with higher production, higher trafficking and higher consumption of heroin and methamphetamine. International drug syndicates have also formed networks within Southeast Asia to manufacture, receive and distribute drugs to the region. So, Mr Edwin Tong is right – this has increased supply and led to a drop in drug prices. Unfortunately, Singapore remains a major destination for these drugs, either for transhipment or for imports.\nThe Central Narcotics Bureau or CNB has maintained its enforcement tempo. In 2014, CNB dismantled 21 drug syndicates and seized about $8 million worth of drugs. Among the drugs seized last year was 35 kilogrammes of cannabis, a 10-year high. This 35 kilogrammes of cannabis can feed more than 5,000 addicts for a week.\nOn the demand side, there are two worrying trends. First, the proportion of younger drug abusers has increased. Of the total drug abusers arrested in 2014, 34% were below the age of 30, up from 29% in 2010. Among new abusers arrested, two-thirds were below the age of 30, up from half in 2010. The educational profile of abusers arrested is also changing, with more from institutions of higher learning. Second, we are arresting more cannabis\nPage: 31\nabusers, with 184 abusers arrested in 2014. The number may be small but this is a 50% increase over five years. The majority of cannabis abusers are young people aged below 30.\nGiven these challenges, it is important that Singapore maintains a zero-tolerance approach against drugs. Zero tolerance means that we strongly reject the scourge of drugs and do not condone its presence in our society. Zero tolerance means that we tackle both drug supply and demand. We take a tough stance against those who wish to profit off drug addicts but, at the same time, we rehabilitate those who consume drugs, even as we take firm action against repeat abusers. I am glad that the community has given its strong support to tackle the drug situation firmly.\nOther countries have chosen a different approach. Because they could not keep drug abuse low, they moved on to address secondary problems arising from drug abuse. They have, for example, opiate substitution programmes to help drug abusers to stay socially functioning, or needle exchange programmes to minimise the spread of HIV. Some states in the US have even decriminalised drug possession to alleviate prison overcrowding. These initiatives do not treat the underlying drug addiction.\nSingapore is different. Our tough drug laws keep our streets largely free from drugs and save lives. More importantly, our laws have kept crime low and deterred organised drug syndicates from operating in Singapore. Let us keep it that way.\nAllow me now to focus on youths and the worrying trend of a rise in youth drug abusers arrested, though the absolute numbers are still small. I currently co-chair a Taskforce on Youths and Drugs with Minister of State Sim Ann, which was set up to tackle the youth drug abuse problem head-on. We will release our findings and recommendations later this year. The recommendations will build on our current comprehensive approach to tackling drug abuse among youths, and this comprises Preventive Drug Education or PDE, effective enforcement and early, targeted intervention for youth abusers.\nUpstream, PDE will continue to be our first line of defence in the war against drugs. We must continue to communicate our strong anti-drug message clearly, and in an engaging and better way that resonates with our youths.\nYouths may have the impression that cannabis is a \"soft\" drug. This is not true. Heroin and methamphetamine addicts in our prisons in Singapore have been known to start their addiction with these drugs with cannabis.\nCannabis, also known as marijuana, weed, or ganja, is addictive and harmful. It is especially harmful to young people and has been linked to impairments in brain\nPage: 32\ndevelopment, psychomotor skills and even cognitive decline with a drop in IQ. The applications of cannabis for managing pain and epilepsy have also not been clinically proven. There are safer and more effective alternatives.\nNext, CNB will continue to maintain its high tempo of enforcement amid a rapidly evolving operating environment. We are constantly on the lookout for emerging drug trends. Let me share some examples.\nFirst, with the rise in e-commerce, some have tried to order drugs online. CNB is watching this development closely. We will intercept suspicious packages and prosecute those who conduct drug transactions online.\nSecond, some youths, when travelling overseas, have been experimenting with drugs because they think that they are beyond the reach of our laws. CNB performs checks at our checkpoints and airports and has taken action against individuals found to have consumed drugs overseas.\nThird, we are keeping an eye on music events. This is after several youths and young adults, including one Singaporean, died from suspected drug overdose at music events held in this region last year.\nFinally, we have enhanced our early intervention programmes for youth drug abusers of different risk profiles. In the past two years, we have introduced the Youth Enhanced Supervision Scheme for first-time low-risk youth abusers and the Community Rehabilitation Centre for those at moderate risk of relapsing to drugs. These new programmes are more targeted and take into account the individual circumstances of abusers.\n12.45 pm\nWe must do all we can to prevent our youths from being tempted by drugs and ensure that those who take drugs do not relapse. All this is possible only if our youths are resilient, possess the will to change and take individual responsibility for their actions. Only then, we can save our youths from drugs and work towards a drug-free society in Singapore.\nMdm Chair, Mr Hri Kumar asked about skills upgrading and employment outcomes for inmates. The Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises or SCORE provides skills training to inmates during their incarceration, and this is aligned to the national Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) framework to improve their employability upon release.\nPage: 33\nSCORE also helps inmates with longer sentences secure employment before their release. This follows through from the training received in prison as an important part of their reintegration process. Those with sentences of less than one year though, who comprise the majority of releases each year, are typically not offered assistance, as they have not been out of the workforce for very long. Post-release though, regardless of sentence length, all ex-offenders can approach SCORE for employment assistance and job matching. However, we only track the employment outcomes of inmates who approach SCORE for assistance. The outcomes have generally been positive. Other than skills training and employment assistance by SCORE, the Yellow Ribbon Project has significantly changed the community's perception of ex-offenders. Ultimately, the onus is on the individual to take charge of his rehabilitation.\nMdm Chair, let me now address Dr Janil Puthucheary and Mr Ang Wei Neng's questions on road safety. In 2014, although injury accidents increased slightly, the number of fatal traffic accidents and fatalities continued to fall. Overall, we have seen improvements in our road traffic situation and our road fatality rate has decreased by more than 50% over the past two decades. More can still be done to improve road safety. The Safer Roads Singapore action plan aims to foster a culture of safe and courteous road use, through a three-pronged strategy of enforcement, education and engagement.\nOn enforcement, our sustained efforts have improved the drink-driving and red-running situation. Even with an increase in the number of drink-driving enforcement operations conducted, I am glad that the number of persons arrested for drink-driving actually fell from 3,019 in 2013 to 2,954 in 2014. The number of fatal accidents involving drink-driving also declined from 14 in 2013 to 10 in 2014.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister spoke about the effectiveness of red light cameras and we hope to do the same for speeding. The number of speeding violations detected increased by 6.5% since 2013 to about 280,000 violations in 2014. The number of fatal accidents involving speeding also increased from 39 in 2013 to 42 in 2014. The Traffic Police have begun installing 20 new digital speed enforcement cameras across 11 locations islandwide starting this week, and we will step up enforcement against speeding. I have personally seen drivers slowing down when approaching traffic junctions, as the traffic lights turn amber, as they are aware of the cameras, or if they think there is one. I am thankful that our motorists have been responsive. I hope that they will also regulate their speed on the roads. Together, we can reduce accidents and save lives.\nI agree with Mr Ang Wei Neng on the need to ensure that heavy vehicle drivers are also safe drivers. We have kept up the enforcement tempo against heavy vehicles, and the number of accidents involving heavy vehicles has remained stable over the last five years. But we can do more. Larger heavy vehicles are also required to install speed limiters, which\nPage: 34\nare regularly inspected.\nOn top of this, we introduced additional speed limiter inspections for those caught speeding. Since then, the number of such heavy vehicles caught multiple times for speeding in a given year declined from 270 in 2013 to 230 in 2014. The total number of heavy vehicle speeding violations also decreased from 1,953 in 2013 to 1,743 in 2014. We will continue keeping a close watch on the situation. Speed limiter or no speed limiter, we expect all our heavy vehicle drivers to drive responsibly. We agree with Mr Ang and work with LTA to explore better methods and better technologies for this purpose.\nOverall, when it comes to enforcement, we will deal firmly but fairly with those who flout our traffic rules. Traffic offences pose a serious danger to other road users. For compoundable offences, the Traffic Police have the authority to issue a composition fine and, where required by law, demerit points, in lieu of court prosecution. Therefore, it saves the offenders the hassle of going through the court process. These penalties will not be waived even upon appeal to the Traffic Police, unless there are very strong extenuating factors which can be substantiated. Should the motorist disagree with the decision, he should present his case to the Court, rather than submitting his appeal to the Traffic Police.\nOn public education, vulnerable road user groups, such as children and elderly pedestrians, remain a priority. Last year, the Traffic Police reached out to more than 45,000 students to teach them good road safety habits. The Traffic Police and the Singapore Road Safety Council also organised two Road Safety Concerts for the Golden Age in 2014, reaching out to more than 2,000 seniors.\nOn engagement, the Government has partnered the transport and logistics industry through the Safer Roads Industry Taskforce to promote safer driving among vocational drivers. We will release the recommendations later this year.\nUltimately, the efforts of the Government alone are not enough. All road users must exercise individual responsibility and practise safe and courteous road use. The Traffic Police will, in the coming months, launch a new road safety campaign to encourage all road users to \"Use Your RoadSense\". This campaign encourages all road users, including motorists, cyclists and pedestrians, to be more patient and careful on the road.\nMdm Chair, finally, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Arthur Fong spoke about the need for strong community partnerships. We have built up and developed community volunteer programmes in many areas over the years.\nPage: 35\nAs the Deputy Prime Minister said, we must now take community partnerships to the next level by helping the community take ownership of its issues and facilitating those who are prepared to play their part. We believe that people are innately willing to help others in need. The Government will do more to encourage and enable more members of the community to play their part, whether it is to be vigilant against terrorism, to fight crime, to deter harassment by illegal moneylenders, or to save lives. We will facilitate this in a systematic and comprehensive way. The Second Minister spoke earlier on how the Police's crowdsourcing initiatives have empowered the community to help detect and deter crime. Our existing community involvement initiatives, like the Yellow Ribbon Community Project and Community Befrienders, are running well. I would now like to touch on how community partnerships will transform our approach towards emergency response.\nIn any emergency, the first few minutes are crucial. The best first responder in such situations is the bystander. For example, in the case of a cardiac arrest, rapid and effective CPR and AED intervention from bystanders increases the chances of survival by as much as 30%. SCDF has empowered bystanders to provide immediate CPR assistance by changing the script of our 995 operators from \"Do you know how to do CPR\" to \"I need you to help administer CPR\". Since the change, the proportion of cardiac arrest victims who receive CPR from bystanders has more than doubled from 22% in 2011 to 47% in 2014.\nWe will go beyond these episodic interventions. Under SCDF's \"Save a Life\" initiative, we will train, equip, and organise a network of community responders that will be able to respond quickly and effectively to cardiac arrest cases in the community. It is imperative that we do so as our population ages and a significant proportion of cardiac arrest cases take place at home. We hope to launch the initiative in all constituencies by end-2018. For a start, we will carry out a pilot later this year in six constituencies – Bedok, Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang, Pasir Ris West, Radin Mas and Tampines West. In particular, I would like to thank Dr Teo Ho Pin for acknowledging the need for such an initiative and volunteering for it during the Budget Debate. SCDF is already in touch with the grassroots leaders in his Bukit Panjang constituency and we will work closely with his constituency on implementation.\nLet me explain how this programme will work. First, in partnership with MOH, we will grow the pool of community responders. All volunteers will be trained to administer CPR and operate AEDs. No prior medical training or background is necessary. Second, we will make AEDs more accessible at HDB blocks. For a start, we will install them at the lift lobbies of every two to three HDB blocks in the pilot constituencies. Third, SCDF has developed a new myResponder App that alerts users to cardiac arrest cases nearby and locates the nearest AEDs. With the \"Save a Life\" initiative, the person who responds to your cardiac arrest can be your friend, can be your neighbour, or even your son or daughter. This is possible when we train our volunteers, equip them properly and then link them to those who need their\nPage: 36\nhelp.\nWe will also help the community organise itself to take greater ownership of its security and emergency response. SCDF and SPF will soon launch the pilot of the Neighbourhood Active Responder Programme or NEAR in two constituencies, in Tampines East and Tampines West. NEAR represents a fundamental shift in the roles that volunteers play in the community – from passive to active first responders. It complements the \"Save a Life\" initiative. NEAR volunteers will be trained to respond to residential fire incidents and medical cases requiring first aid treatment, including cardiac arrest cases. On weekends, when activated, they will respond to these emergencies in bicycles equipped with a combination of a first aid kit, AED, fire extinguishers and smoke evacuation hoods.\nThey will also patrol their estate and be on the lookout for suspicious characters and crimes in progress. About 100 persons have thus far stepped forward to volunteer and we hope to implement this programme in more and in all constituencies.\nThe safety and security of our community is our collective responsibility. Community partnerships have a tremendous multiplier effect on the Home Team's efforts. Our volunteers are a dedicated and passionate group, comprising individuals of all ages and from all walks of life. I commend their tireless contributions and sacrifice, and look forward to many more members of the community joining us to do their part to keep neighbourhoods and Singapore safe and secure.\nMdm Chair, Singapore remains safe and secure because of the hard work put in by the Home Team. We must not take this for granted. As the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned, we will augment the Home Team with more manpower and resources, and invest in systems and technology. Community partnerships are the third pillar to this strategy and we will take our partnership to the next level in the coming years. Together, these three pillars will form our overall strategy going forward to ensure Singapore remains safe and secure.\nThe Chairman\n:",
      "Mr Vikram Nair\n: Chairman, in many parts of the world, drug use is a problem getting out of control. Even in developed countries like the US, the opioid crisis haunts many of its largest cities. Thousands of lives are ruined by the ready availability of drugs all over the world.\nSingapore has remained a relative oasis against this scourge thanks to a combination of strong laws, including the death penalty, against drug trafficking. Strong enforcement of the laws and national education as well support these measures. Singapore's rates of drug addiction have been amongst the lowest in the world.\nConcerningly though, Central Narcotics Bureau's (CNB's) latest figures on drug use amongst youths shows a larger number of arrests over the last two years amongst users below 20 years old. Do these figures suggest growing drug use amongst youths? What are MHA's strategies for dealing with the rise of drug use amongst youths in Singapore?\nScams\nChairman, Singapore is amongst the safest cities in the world and we are proud of our low crime rates. Unfortunately, one area of vulnerability for us has been scams. According to reports, last year, our people lost $1.1 billion to scams, with the largest number of cases ever reported. The figure is around 70% higher than the $651.8 million that scammers took in 2023.\nIn recent years, MHA has taken a variety of measures to combat scams, including better education and publicity, rolling out the ScamShield app and engaging in cooperation internationally to try and crack down on scam operators. Notwithstanding these measures, it appears the problem continues to grow and scammers are thriving.\nThe most recent measures include action being taken against Singaporeans who may have assisted foreign scammers, including those who help with opening bank accounts that are being used to facilitate scams.\nWould the MHA consider taking stricter measures to better detect and deter local Singaporeans from assisting scam operations, in particular, by being money mules?\nIn some ways, this is similar to the measures we have taken against drug traffickers and illegal moneylenders. While we may be unable to take action against foreign principals, by taking a zero-tolerance approach against their agents in Singapore, we managed to bring both of those problems under better control.\nI understand from previous COS debates that the transnational nature of scams makes it difficult to both combat scams and recover the victims' assets. Does the MHA have any further thoughts on how this may be addressed?\nThe Chairman\n:",
      "(Mr Amrin Amin)\n: Mr Chairman, I will focus on two areas: first, keeping Singapore drug-free; and second, supporting the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.\nMembers spoke about the fight against drugs. Mr Christopher de Souza spoke about stemming the supply and demand of drugs. Keeping Singapore drug-free is a key priority for MHA. This requires a combination of tough laws, effective enforcement and preventive education.\nThe Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has kept up enforcement efforts. Last year, CNB dismantled 23 drug syndicates, and conducted 19 islandwide operations targeting drug traffickers and abusers. CNB also conducted 12 joint operations with our foreign counterparts to cut out drug supplies from overseas. Just last week, CNB had a joint operation with their Malaysian counterparts to smash a regional drug syndicate.\nMr Christopher de Souza and Mr Baey Yam Keng spoke about emerging drug threats such as the purchase of drugs online and New Psychoactive Substances. These are indeed areas of concern. There are people in Singapore who have tried to buy drugs online. They thought they could get away with it. They were wrong. Last year, CNB worked with courier companies to detect more than 350 parcels with drugs or drug-related products. CNB’s follow-up investigations led to the arrest of 177 individuals. We will continue to clamp down online drug trade.\nNew Psychoactive Substances, or “NPS”, is a global challenge that many countries are grappling with. So far, the NPS situation in Singapore is contained. This is because we keep a close watch for any new substances, and list them in our Misuse of Drugs Act. Regular reviews of our legislative and operational strategies are conducted to combat NPS abuse. Enforcement alone is not enough. To keep Singapore drug-free, all Singaporeans must know that drugs are harmful and stay away from them.\nMr Edwin Tong and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked how we can better engage youths and tackle the high proportion of new and young drug abusers.\nIn 2017, two out of five abusers arrested were new abusers. Close to two-thirds, or 64%, of new abusers arrested were under 30 years old. This is very worrying and there are foreign celebrities who glamourise drug use and they falsely advocate drugs as harmless and “cool”. Our youths must not be fooled.\nMinister earlier mentioned about Portuguese campaign − \"Say no to second-hand syringes\". In Singapore, we have a different campaign. We promote a drug-free life. We advocate a life free from addiction and we encourage our youths to enjoy life to the fullest and make the best of life's opportunities. Be yourself. Hashtag. Be drug-free – these are taglines that are trending here in Singapore. This is the narrative: we reject drugs and we reject the notion that drugs are harmless or \"cool\". They destroy life, health and family; and drug abuse is not a victimless crime.\nWe have ramped up our preventive drug education efforts in the last year, both on the ground and on social media. Besides school programmes and roadshows, CNB collaborated with education institutions and young local filmmakers to produce a series of videos showing the destructive effect of drugs.\nEighteen short films were posted on CNB’s Instagram and Facebook with the handle #FilmFriday, racking up close to two million views in total.\nTo reach out to more youths, CNB also set up a makeshift club called “GURD Club” outside Cathay Cineplex. “GURD Club” featured lights and sounds which simulated the disorientating and distressing effects of drugs. More than 4,300 anti-drug pledges were collected.\nOur community is with us in this fight against drugs.

      "(Mr Amrin Amin)\n: Mr Chairman, I will focus on two areas: first, keeping Singapore drug-free; and second, supporting the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.\nMembers spoke about the fight against drugs. Mr Christopher de Souza spoke about stemming the supply and demand of drugs. Keeping Singapore drug-free is a key priority for MHA. This requires a combination of tough laws, effective enforcement and preventive education.\nThe Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has kept up enforcement efforts. Last year, CNB dismantled 23 drug syndicates, and conducted 19 islandwide operations targeting drug traffickers and abusers. CNB also conducted 12 joint operations with our foreign counterparts to cut out drug supplies from overseas. Just last week, CNB had a joint operation with their Malaysian counterparts to smash a regional drug syndicate.\nMr Christopher de Souza and Mr Baey Yam Keng spoke about emerging drug threats such as the purchase of drugs online and New Psychoactive Substances. These are indeed areas of concern. There are people in Singapore who have tried to buy drugs online. They thought they could get away with it. They were wrong. Last year, CNB worked with courier companies to detect more than 350 parcels with drugs or drug-related products. CNB’s follow-up investigations led to the arrest of 177 individuals. We will continue to clamp down online drug trade.\nNew Psychoactive Substances, or “NPS”, is a global challenge that many countries are grappling with. So far, the NPS situation in Singapore is contained. This is because we keep a close watch for any new substances, and list them in our Misuse of Drugs Act. Regular reviews of our legislative and operational strategies are conducted to combat NPS abuse. Enforcement alone is not enough. To keep Singapore drug-free, all Singaporeans must know that drugs are harmful and stay away from them.\nMr Edwin Tong and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked how we can better engage youths and tackle the high proportion of new and young drug abusers.\nIn 2017, two out of five abusers arrested were new abusers. Close to two-thirds, or 64%, of new abusers arrested were under 30 years old. This is very worrying and there are foreign celebrities who glamourise drug use and they falsely advocate drugs as harmless and “cool”. Our youths must not be fooled.\nMinister earlier mentioned about Portuguese campaign − \"Say no to second-hand syringes\". In Singapore, we have a different campaign. We promote a drug-free life. We advocate a life free from addiction and we encourage our youths to enjoy life to the fullest and make the best of life's opportunities. Be yourself. Hashtag. Be drug-free – these are taglines that are trending here in Singapore. This is the narrative: we reject drugs and we reject the notion that drugs are harmless or \"cool\". They destroy life, health and family; and drug abuse is not a victimless crime.\nWe have ramped up our preventive drug education efforts in the last year, both on the ground and on social media. Besides school programmes and roadshows, CNB collaborated with education institutions and young local filmmakers to produce a series of videos showing the destructive effect of drugs.\nEighteen short films were posted on CNB’s Instagram and Facebook with the handle #FilmFriday, racking up close to two million views in total.\nTo reach out to more youths, CNB also set up a makeshift club called “GURD Club” outside Cathay Cineplex. “GURD Club” featured lights and sounds which simulated the disorientating and distressing effects of drugs. More than 4,300 anti-drug pledges were collected.\nOur community is with us in this fight against drugs. Our United Against Drugs Coalition partners include Pastamania and Singapore Post, just to name a few, and they have helped to distribute 50,000 “DrugFreeSG” keychains to the public during our Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign last year. Online retailer Reebonz distributed 5,000 anti-drug message cards in their parcels during Christmas last year.\nMs Rahayu Mahzam spoke about engaging the community, especially the Malay Muslim community. Mr Chairman, please allow me to speak in Malay on this.\n(\nIn Malay\n)\n:",
      "Mr K Shanmugam\n: As the Member pointed out, New Psychoactive Substances, also known as NPS, have been wrongly perceived by some people to be less addictive and less dangerous. Nothing could be further from the truth. These drugs are known to have adverse, irreversible physical and psychological effects.\nThe Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) adopts a targeted approach to raise awareness about the harms of drugs. Since 2016, CNB has been driving an online campaign to strengthen the resilience of our youths against drug misinformation. They are provided with facts about the harms of drugs, including NPS, to counter the false information being propagated online that downplays the danger. CNB has enhanced its social media platforms to push out its messages. Many of the anti-drug videos posted online by CNB have been widely viewed. CNB will continue with these social media campaigns to feature bite-sized infographics and youth-centric content.\nTo address the increasingly liberal attitudes among youths, the National Council Against Drug Abuse, or NCADA, launched a \"Feed Ambition. Fight Temptation\" campaign in October 2018. Opinion leaders were roped in to engage youths in a mentorship programme, encouraging them to pursue their passion and stay away from drugs.\nYouths are also given the opportunity to take greater ownership in the fight against drugs. In December last year, a new illustrated book \"Captain Drug Buster versus Dr Wacko: The Final Showdown\" was published. This was a collaboration with young illustrators. The book educates children on the harms of drug abuse, and serves as a resource for parents and educators to start the conversation on drugs with the young ones. We will make copies of the book widely available.\nCNB has also been engaging NS commanders and educators on a sustained basis, to raise their awareness and understanding of Singapore’s drug control policies, as well as to rally their support for anti-drug advocacy.\nA DrugFreeSG Community Roadshow was held in April 2018 to enhance outreach in the heartlands, targeting parents. Two more will be organised in 2019.\nThese are just some examples of CNB's preventive drug education efforts. We have seen encouraging results. We will need to continue countering the increasingly widespread portrayal in the popular media, of drug consumption as being a socially acceptable activity.",
      "Mr Vikram Nair\n: Chairman, in many parts of the world, drug use is a problem getting out of control. Even in developed countries like the US, the opioid crisis haunts many of its largest cities. Thousands of lives are ruined by the ready availability of drugs all over the world.\nSingapore has remained a relative oasis against this scourge thanks to a combination of strong laws, including the death penalty, against drug trafficking. Strong enforcement of the laws and national education as well support these measures. Singapore's rates of drug addiction have been amongst the lowest in the world.\nConcerningly though, Central Narcotics Bureau's (CNB's) latest figures on drug use amongst youths shows a larger number of arrests over the last two years amongst users below 20 years old. Do these figures suggest growing drug use amongst youths? What are MHA's strategies for dealing with the rise of drug use amongst youths in Singapore?\nScams\nChairman, Singapore is amongst the safest cities in the world and we are proud of our low crime rates. Unfortunately, one area of vulnerability for us has been scams. According to reports, last year, our people lost $1.1 billion to scams, with the largest number of cases ever reported. The figure is around 70% higher than the $651.8 million that scammers took in 2023.\nIn recent years, MHA has taken a variety of measures to combat scams, including better education and publicity, rolling out the ScamShield app and engaging in cooperation internationally to try and crack down on scam operators. Notwithstanding these measures, it appears the problem continues to grow and scammers are thriving.\nThe most recent measures include action being taken against Singaporeans who may have assisted foreign scammers, including those who help with opening bank accounts that are being used to facilitate scams.\nWould the MHA consider taking stricter measures to better detect and deter local Singaporeans from assisting scam operations, in particular, by being money mules?\nIn some ways, this is similar to the measures we have taken against drug traffickers and illegal moneylenders. While we may be unable to take action against foreign principals, by taking a zero-tolerance approach against their agents in Singapore, we managed to bring both of those problems under better control.\nI understand from previous COS debates that the transnational nature of scams makes it difficult to both combat scams and recover the victims' assets. Does the MHA have any further thoughts on how this may be addressed?\nThe Chairman\n:"

      "Ms Rahayu Mahzam\n: Chairman, I have two questions. One for the Second Minister. I just want to clarify on the effectiveness of SGSecure. Has SGSecure been effective in increasing awareness and also preparedness of Singaporeans?\nMy second clarification is to the Parliamentary Secretary. I just want to check. It has to do with the drug issue, not a new issue. We surely have experience and some data. I am just wondering if the Ministry conducts studies and also perhaps use behavioural insights to inform it and to help it in its preventive drug outreach.\nMrs Josephine Teo\n:",
      "(Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)\n: Mdm Chair, I will now speak on the drug situation in Singapore, road safety and the Home Team's efforts in community partnerships.\nFirst, an update on the overall drug situation, which Mr Edwin Tong asked about. The international and regional drug situation continues to be challenging, with higher production, higher trafficking and higher consumption of heroin and methamphetamine. International drug syndicates have also formed networks within Southeast Asia to manufacture, receive and distribute drugs to the region. So, Mr Edwin Tong is right – this has increased supply and led to a drop in drug prices. Unfortunately, Singapore remains a major destination for these drugs, either for transhipment or for imports.\nThe Central Narcotics Bureau or CNB has maintained its enforcement tempo. In 2014, CNB dismantled 21 drug syndicates and seized about $8 million worth of drugs. Among the drugs seized last year was 35 kilogrammes of cannabis, a 10-year high. This 35 kilogrammes of cannabis can feed more than 5,000 addicts for a week.\nOn the demand side, there are two worrying trends. First, the proportion of younger drug abusers has increased. Of the total drug abusers arrested in 2014, 34% were below the age of 30, up from 29% in 2010. Among new abusers arrested, two-thirds were below the age of 30, up from half in 2010. The educational profile of abusers arrested is also changing, with more from institutions of higher learning. Second, we are arresting more cannabis\nPage: 31\nabusers, with 184 abusers arrested in 2014. The number may be small but this is a 50% increase over five years. The majority of cannabis abusers are young people aged below 30.\nGiven these challenges, it is important that Singapore maintains a zero-tolerance approach against drugs. Zero tolerance means that we strongly reject the scourge of drugs and do not condone its presence in our society. Zero tolerance means that we tackle both drug supply and demand. We take a tough stance against those who wish to profit off drug addicts but, at the same time, we rehabilitate those who consume drugs, even as we take firm action against repeat abusers. I am glad that the community has given its strong support to tackle the drug situation firmly.\nOther countries have chosen a different approach. Because they could not keep drug abuse low, they moved on to address secondary problems arising from drug abuse. They have, for example, opiate substitution programmes to help drug abusers to stay socially functioning, or needle exchange programmes to minimise the spread of HIV. Some states in the US have even decriminalised drug possession to alleviate prison overcrowding. These initiatives do not treat the underlying drug addiction.\nSingapore is different. Our tough drug laws keep our streets largely free from drugs and save lives. More importantly, our laws have kept crime low and deterred organised drug syndicates from operating in Singapore. Let us keep it that way.\nAllow me now to focus on youths and the worrying trend of a rise in youth drug abusers arrested, though the absolute numbers are still small. I currently co-chair a Taskforce on Youths and Drugs with Minister of State Sim Ann, which was set up to tackle the youth drug abuse problem head-on. We will release our findings and recommendations later this year. The recommendations will build on our current comprehensive approach to tackling drug abuse among youths, and this comprises Preventive Drug Education or PDE, effective enforcement and early, targeted intervention for youth abusers.\nUpstream, PDE will continue to be our first line of defence in the war against drugs. We must continue to communicate our strong anti-drug message clearly, and in an engaging and better way that resonates with our youths.\nYouths may have the impression that cannabis is a \"soft\" drug. This is not true. Heroin and methamphetamine addicts in our prisons in Singapore have been known to start their addiction with these drugs with cannabis.\nCannabis, also known as marijuana, weed, or ganja, is addictive and harmful. It is especially harmful to young people and has been linked to impairments in brain\nPage: 32\ndevelopment, psychomotor skills and even cognitive decline with a drop in IQ. The applications of cannabis for managing pain and epilepsy have also not been clinically proven. There are safer and more effective alternatives.\nNext, CNB will continue to maintain its high tempo of enforcement amid a rapidly evolving operating environment. We are constantly on the lookout for emerging drug trends. Let me share some examples.\nFirst, with the rise in e-commerce, some have tried to order drugs online. CNB is watching this development closely. We will intercept suspicious packages and prosecute those who conduct drug transactions online.\nSecond, some youths, when travelling overseas, have been experimenting with drugs because they think that they are beyond the reach of our laws. CNB performs checks at our checkpoints and airports and has taken action against individuals found to have consumed drugs overseas.\nThird, we are keeping an eye on music events. This is after several youths and young adults, including one Singaporean, died from suspected drug overdose at music events held in this region last year.\nFinally, we have enhanced our early intervention programmes for youth drug abusers of different risk profiles. In the past two years, we have introduced the Youth Enhanced Supervision Scheme for first-time low-risk youth abusers and the Community Rehabilitation Centre for those at moderate risk of relapsing to drugs. These new programmes are more targeted and take into account the individual circumstances of abusers.\n12.45 pm\nWe must do all we can to prevent our youths from being tempted by drugs and ensure that those who take drugs do not relapse. All this is possible only if our youths are resilient, possess the will to change and take individual responsibility for their actions. Only then, we can save our youths from drugs and work towards a drug-free society in Singapore.\nMdm Chair, Mr Hri Kumar asked about skills upgrading and employment outcomes for inmates. The Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises or SCORE provides skills training to inmates during their incarceration, and this is aligned to the national Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) framework to improve their employability upon release.\nPage: 33\nSCORE also helps inmates with longer sentences secure employment before their release. This follows through from the training received in prison as an important part of their reintegration process. Those with sentences of less than one year though, who comprise the majority of releases each year, are typically not offered assistance, as they have not been out of the workforce for very long. Post-release though, regardless of sentence length, all ex-offenders can approach SCORE for employment assistance and job matching. However, we only track the employment outcomes of inmates who approach SCORE for assistance. The outcomes have generally been positive. Other than skills training and employment assistance by SCORE, the Yellow Ribbon Project has significantly changed the community's perception of ex-offenders. Ultimately, the onus is on the individual to take charge of his rehabilitation.\nMdm Chair, let me now address Dr Janil Puthucheary and Mr Ang Wei Neng's questions on road safety. In 2014, although injury accidents increased slightly, the number of fatal traffic accidents and fatalities continued to fall. Overall, we have seen improvements in our road traffic situation and our road fatality rate has decreased by more than 50% over the past two decades. More can still be done to improve road safety. The Safer Roads Singapore action plan aims to foster a culture of safe and courteous road use, through a three-pronged strategy of enforcement, education and engagement.\nOn enforcement, our sustained efforts have improved the drink-driving and red-running situation. Even with an increase in the number of drink-driving enforcement operations conducted, I am glad that the number of persons arrested for drink-driving actually fell from 3,019 in 2013 to 2,954 in 2014. The number of fatal accidents involving drink-driving also declined from 14 in 2013 to 10 in 2014.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister spoke about the effectiveness of red light cameras and we hope to do the same for speeding. The number of speeding violations detected increased by 6.5% since 2013 to about 280,000 violations in 2014. The number of fatal accidents involving speeding also increased from 39 in 2013 to 42 in 2014. The Traffic Police have begun installing 20 new digital speed enforcement cameras across 11 locations islandwide starting this week, and we will step up enforcement against speeding. I have personally seen drivers slowing down when approaching traffic junctions, as the traffic lights turn amber, as they are aware of the cameras, or if they think there is one. I am thankful that our motorists have been responsive. I hope that they will also regulate their speed on the roads. Together, we can reduce accidents and save lives.\nI agree with Mr Ang Wei Neng on the need to ensure that heavy vehicle drivers are also safe drivers. We have kept up the enforcement tempo against heavy vehicles, and the number of accidents involving heavy vehicles has remained stable over the last five years. But we can do more. Larger heavy vehicles are also required to install speed limiters, which\nPage: 34\nare regularly inspected.\nOn top of this, we introduced additional speed limiter inspections for those caught speeding. Since then, the number of such heavy vehicles caught multiple times for speeding in a given year declined from 270 in 2013 to 230 in 2014. The total number of heavy vehicle speeding violations also decreased from 1,953 in 2013 to 1,743 in 2014. We will continue keeping a close watch on the situation. Speed limiter or no speed limiter, we expect all our heavy vehicle drivers to drive responsibly. We agree with Mr Ang and work with LTA to explore better methods and better technologies for this purpose.\nOverall, when it comes to enforcement, we will deal firmly but fairly with those who flout our traffic rules. Traffic offences pose a serious danger to other road users. For compoundable offences, the Traffic Police have the authority to issue a composition fine and, where required by law, demerit points, in lieu of court prosecution. Therefore, it saves the offenders the hassle of going through the court process. These penalties will not be waived even upon appeal to the Traffic Police, unless there are very strong extenuating factors which can be substantiated. Should the motorist disagree with the decision, he should present his case to the Court, rather than submitting his appeal to the Traffic Police.\nOn public education, vulnerable road user groups, such as children and elderly pedestrians, remain a priority. Last year, the Traffic Police reached out to more than 45,000 students to teach them good road safety habits. The Traffic Police and the Singapore Road Safety Council also organised two Road Safety Concerts for the Golden Age in 2014, reaching out to more than 2,000 seniors.\nOn engagement, the Government has partnered the transport and logistics industry through the Safer Roads Industry Taskforce to promote safer driving among vocational drivers. We will release the recommendations later this year.\nUltimately, the efforts of the Government alone are not enough. All road users must exercise individual responsibility and practise safe and courteous road use. The Traffic Police will, in the coming months, launch a new road safety campaign to encourage all road users to \"Use Your RoadSense\". This campaign encourages all road users, including motorists, cyclists and pedestrians, to be more patient and careful on the road.\nMdm Chair, finally, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Arthur Fong spoke about the need for strong community partnerships. We have built up and developed community volunteer programmes in many areas over the years.\nPage: 35\nAs the Deputy Prime Minister said, we must now take community partnerships to the next level by helping the community take ownership of its issues and facilitating those who are prepared to play their part. We believe that people are innately willing to help others in need. The Government will do more to encourage and enable more members of the community to play their part, whether it is to be vigilant against terrorism, to fight crime, to deter harassment by illegal moneylenders, or to save lives. We will facilitate this in a systematic and comprehensive way. The Second Minister spoke earlier on how the Police's crowdsourcing initiatives have empowered the community to help detect and deter crime. Our existing community involvement initiatives, like the Yellow Ribbon Community Project and Community Befrienders, are running well. I would now like to touch on how community partnerships will transform our approach towards emergency response.\nIn any emergency, the first few minutes are crucial. The best first responder in such situations is the bystander. For example, in the case of a cardiac arrest, rapid and effective CPR and AED intervention from bystanders increases the chances of survival by as much as 30%. SCDF has empowered bystanders to provide immediate CPR assistance by changing the script of our 995 operators from \"Do you know how to do CPR\" to \"I need you to help administer CPR\". Since the change, the proportion of cardiac arrest victims who receive CPR from bystanders has more than doubled from 22% in 2011 to 47% in 2014.\nWe will go beyond these episodic interventions. Under SCDF's \"Save a Life\" initiative, we will train, equip, and organise a network of community responders that will be able to respond quickly and effectively to cardiac arrest cases in the community. It is imperative that we do so as our population ages and a significant proportion of cardiac arrest cases take place at home. We hope to launch the initiative in all constituencies by end-2018. For a start, we will carry out a pilot later this year in six constituencies – Bedok, Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang, Pasir Ris West, Radin Mas and Tampines West. In particular, I would like to thank Dr Teo Ho Pin for acknowledging the need for such an initiative and volunteering for it during the Budget Debate. SCDF is already in touch with the grassroots leaders in his Bukit Panjang constituency and we will work closely with his constituency on implementation.\nLet me explain how this programme will work. First, in partnership with MOH, we will grow the pool of community responders. All volunteers will be trained to administer CPR and operate AEDs. No prior medical training or background is necessary. Second, we will make AEDs more accessible at HDB blocks. For a start, we will install them at the lift lobbies of every two to three HDB blocks in the pilot constituencies. Third, SCDF has developed a new myResponder App that alerts users to cardiac arrest cases nearby and locates the nearest AEDs. With the \"Save a Life\" initiative, the person who responds to your cardiac arrest can be your friend, can be your neighbour, or even your son or daughter. This is possible when we train our volunteers, equip them properly and then link them to those who need their\nPage: 36\nhelp.\nWe will also help the community organise itself to take greater ownership of its security and emergency response. SCDF and SPF will soon launch the pilot of the Neighbourhood Active Responder Programme or NEAR in two constituencies, in Tampines East and Tampines West. NEAR represents a fundamental shift in the roles that volunteers play in the community – from passive to active first responders. It complements the \"Save a Life\" initiative. NEAR volunteers will be trained to respond to residential fire incidents and medical cases requiring first aid treatment, including cardiac arrest cases. On weekends, when activated, they will respond to these emergencies in bicycles equipped with a combination of a first aid kit, AED, fire extinguishers and smoke evacuation hoods.\nThey will also patrol their estate and be on the lookout for suspicious characters and crimes in progress. About 100 persons have thus far stepped forward to volunteer and we hope to implement this programme in more and in all constituencies.\nThe safety and security of our community is our collective responsibility. Community partnerships have a tremendous multiplier effect on the Home Team's efforts. Our volunteers are a dedicated and passionate group, comprising individuals of all ages and from all walks of life. I commend their tireless contributions and sacrifice, and look forward to many more members of the community joining us to do their part to keep neighbourhoods and Singapore safe and secure.\nMdm Chair, Singapore remains safe and secure because of the hard work put in by the Home Team. We must not take this for granted. As the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned, we will augment the Home Team with more manpower and resources, and invest in systems and technology. Community partnerships are the third pillar to this strategy and we will take our partnership to the next level in the coming years. Together, these three pillars will form our overall strategy going forward to ensure Singapore remains safe and secure.\nThe Chairman\n:",
      "(Mr Amrin Amin)\n: Mdm Chair, I thank Members for their support for the Home Team's work, and I will speak on two areas: first, the scourge of drugs; and the second, the rehabilitation and re-integration of ex-offenders.\nMr Christopher de Souza asked about our drug situation and the strategies to combat this trend. The overall drug abuse situation in Singapore is under control. In 2016, there was a 3% drop in the number of drug abusers arrested compared to 2015, but there are areas of concern. Close to two-thirds of the new drug abusers arrested were below the age of 30, and we are also seeing more cases of students abusing drugs. Therefore, we cannot take our foot off the pedal in the fight against drugs.\nEven with our tough drug laws and active enforcement, we remain vulnerable to the global and regional drug trade. Minister Shanmugam highlighted the situation in the Golden Triangle, as well as the cross-border drug syndicate activities. We must continue to strengthen our enforcement efforts and regional cooperation. CNB works closely with its foreign partners to target syndicates which attempt to supply drugs to Singapore. For example, last December, CNB and the Malaysian Narcotics Crime Investigation Department (NCID) coordinated operations to successfully nab an elusive Malaysian and his associates, who were supplying a sizeable amount of drugs into Singapore.\nAt the same time, we need to reduce demand and step up preventive drug education so that Singaporeans know the dangers of drugs.\nDr Tan Wu Meng highlighted the growing movement overseas to sugar-coat the drug problem. Our youths are not immune from this influence. And on the Internet, our youths see drugs being glamourised. They read about the legalisation of cannabis overseas, and they hear that drugs like cannabis are less harmful and addictive. But this is not true.\nA review conducted by experts at Singapore's Institute of Mental Health found that cannabis is both harmful and addictive, and chronic exposure to cannabis during adolescence is linked to lower IQ and possibly irreversible decline in cognitive performance, lasting into adulthood.\nThe World Health Organization has also compiled research which found that regular cannabis users were more likely to take other drugs like heroin and cocaine.\nTo better engage youths and extend the outreach, CNB has developed a multi-pronged strategy.\nFirst, CNB has been increasing their social media presence, and they have produced videos to convey accurate information on harms of drugs. These are shared online, as well as during drug prevention talks and roadshows.\nSecond, CNB is piloting a new initiative to establish positive \"influencers\" in peer circles. Youths from ITEs, Polytechnics and Universities have signed up for the pilot of an Anti-Drug Advocate (ADA) Programme. These youths will learn about the harmful effects of drugs and Singapore's drug policies. They will visit Halfway Houses and drug rehabilitation centres (DRCs), hearing first-hand accounts from ex-abusers on how hard it is to kick the drug habit. These youths will see what is really at stake if they try drugs. We hope the experience will encourage them to start their own initiatives to spread the anti-drug message to their friends.\nWe need more people to step forward to spread the anti-drug message. Prevention is our first line of defence, and a key part of the battle is won if we keep our people away from drugs.\nHowever, when someone starts to abuse drugs, we must help them to stop. And it is vital that we curb the vicious cycle of re-offending and prevent the spread of drug to non-abusers.\nLast year, CNB arrested a man for drug trafficking. He mixed with bad company, picked up drugs, and never successfully quit. What happened next was worse, he taught his two young sons, aged 19 and 20, to smoke \"ice\". He got them addicted and even supplied their habit.\nWe share Dr Tan Wu Meng's concern on the impact of drug abuse on the family. If we do not succeed rehabilitating offenders, their families including their children may end up becoming victims or offenders. Curbing inter-generational offending starts up-stream, and this applies to both drug abuse and crime. This is an area which we are working with other agencies to better understand and tackle.\nThe rehabilitation process starts upon admission. Inmates are assessed for their risk of re-offending and severity of drug abuse, and depending on risk levels, inmates undergo different programmes which address criminal thinking and addiction issues. They also undergo family support programmes, religious programmes and skills training.\nTo ease their transition back into the community, they can later be emplaced in a Halfway House or on home detention. Under the Day Release Scheme introduced last year, first-time lower risk inmates can also go out to work and study during the day. We hope these measures help inmates better reintegrate into society.\nMr Louis Ng asked about the role of family support in rehabilitation. Indeed, this is one of the key factors that motivate ex-offenders to rebuild their lives and to keep themselves away from re-offending.\nSingapore Prison Service (SPS) partners with Fei Yue Family Services and Lakeside Family Services to provide structured family programmes for inmates −workshops to help better understand the impact of their crimes on their families and build their parenting and communication skills.\nThe Prison Service also works with community partners like the Salvation Army to conduct family sessions in prison. During these sessions, family members are allowed to enter Prison to spend time with the inmates, and they are designed to encourage bonding between inmates and their children, and they serve as powerful reminders to inmates that they need to turn their lives around. These family sessions are also held during special occasions, such as Mothers' Day, Fathers' Day, and Children's Day.\nOther than helping the inmate, Singapore Prison Service also helps their families. The grassroots-led Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) was established to help the families and children of inmates cope, by connecting them to the national social support networks. YRCP has assisted more than 5,000 families. We recognise that family ties are vital to the inmates' rehabilitation and family support is especially important after the inmates' release, and thus, the community's long-term involvement is vital to ensure continuity in these efforts.\nMadam, I understand that my time on the clock has run out. Can I proceed to finish up my answer —”\nThe Chairman\n:"

We will need to continue countering the increasingly widespread portrayal in the popular media, of drug consumption as being a socially acceptable activity.",
      "(Mr Amrin Amin)\n: Mr Chairman, I will focus on two areas: first, keeping Singapore drug-free; and second, supporting the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.\nMembers spoke about the fight against drugs. Mr Christopher de Souza spoke about stemming the supply and demand of drugs. Keeping Singapore drug-free is a key priority for MHA. This requires a combination of tough laws, effective enforcement and preventive education.\nThe Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has kept up enforcement efforts. Last year, CNB dismantled 23 drug syndicates, and conducted 19 islandwide operations targeting drug traffickers and abusers. CNB also conducted 12 joint operations with our foreign counterparts to cut out drug supplies from overseas. Just last week, CNB had a joint operation with their Malaysian counterparts to smash a regional drug syndicate.\nMr Christopher de Souza and Mr Baey Yam Keng spoke about emerging drug threats such as the purchase of drugs online and New Psychoactive Substances. These are indeed areas of concern. There are people in Singapore who have tried to buy drugs online. They thought they could get away with it. They were wrong. Last year, CNB worked with courier companies to detect more than 350 parcels with drugs or drug-related products. CNB’s follow-up investigations led to the arrest of 177 individuals. We will continue to clamp down online drug trade.\nNew Psychoactive Substances, or “NPS”, is a global challenge that many countries are grappling with. So far, the NPS situation in Singapore is contained. This is because we keep a close watch for any new substances, and list them in our Misuse of Drugs Act. Regular reviews of our legislative and operational strategies are conducted to combat NPS abuse. Enforcement alone is not enough. To keep Singapore drug-free, all Singaporeans must know that drugs are harmful and stay away from them.\nMr Edwin Tong and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked how we can better engage youths and tackle the high proportion of new and young drug abusers.\nIn 2017, two out of five abusers arrested were new abusers. Close to two-thirds, or 64%, of new abusers arrested were under 30 years old. This is very worrying and there are foreign celebrities who glamourise drug use and they falsely advocate drugs as harmless and “cool”. Our youths must not be fooled.\nMinister earlier mentioned about Portuguese campaign − \"Say no to second-hand syringes\". In Singapore, we have a different campaign. We promote a drug-free life. We advocate a life free from addiction and we encourage our youths to enjoy life to the fullest and make the best of life's opportunities. Be yourself. Hashtag. Be drug-free – these are taglines that are trending here in Singapore. This is the narrative: we reject drugs and we reject the notion that drugs are harmless or \"cool\". They destroy life, health and family; and drug abuse is not a victimless crime.\nWe have ramped up our preventive drug education efforts in the last year, both on the ground and on social media. Besides school programmes and roadshows, CNB collaborated with education institutions and young local filmmakers to produce a series of videos showing the destructive effect of drugs.\nEighteen short films were posted on CNB’s Instagram and Facebook with the handle #FilmFriday, racking up close to two million views in total.\nTo reach out to more youths, CNB also set up a makeshift club called “GURD Club” outside Cathay Cineplex. “GURD Club” featured lights and sounds which simulated the disorientating and distressing effects of drugs. More than 4,300 anti-drug pledges were collected.\nOur community is with us in this fight against drugs. Our United Against Drugs Coalition partners include Pastamania and Singapore Post, just to name a few, and they have helped to distribute 50,000 “DrugFreeSG” keychains to the public during our Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign last year. Online retailer Reebonz distributed 5,000 anti-drug message cards in their parcels during Christmas last year.\nMs Rahayu Mahzam spoke about engaging the community, especially the Malay Muslim community. Mr Chairman, please allow me to speak in Malay on this.\n(\nIn Malay\n)\n:",
      "(Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]\nThis trend poses implications for young people, for patients and for healthcare professionals. Young Singaporeans studying or working in jurisdictions which have legalised cannabis, may have attitudes towards drugs shaped by the social environment there. Patients in Singapore may read online posts about jurisdictions which have legalised cannabis for medical use. Healthcare professionals in turn may be faced with challenging conversations with patients, who might ask about differing policies regarding legalisation of cannabis for medical use, across different countries. What is the Government’s assessment of this emerging trend in overseas jurisdictions? And what is the Government’s response?\nYouths and Drug Abuse\nMr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir)\n: Mr Chairman, Singapore has always taken a tough stance against drug abuse. For drug traffickers, the death penalty may even be imposed. This policy stance takes into account the potential damage and detrimental effects that drug abusers cause themselves, their families and the wider Singaporean Community.\nI do not think that this belief has changed over the years amongst the majority of Singaporeans.\nThe recent numbers for 2018 released by the Central Narcotics Bureau, however, reveal a worrying trend.\nThe total number of drug abusers arrested in 2018 increased by 11% from 2017. Of the 3,438 drug abusers who were arrested in 2018, about 40% or 1,370 of them were below 30 years old. Drug abusers in the 20 to 29 years age group continue to form the largest group of abusers in 2018. In particular, of the total number of drug abusers arrested in 2018 – 40% were new abusers. Of these new abusers, about two-thirds or about 64% were under 30 years old. The numbers suggest that there is a worrying trend where our youths of today have a more liberal attitude towards the use of drugs and are more likely to engage or partake in them. Sir, this is a trend that we must arrest.\nIt has been reported in the media just this week that there are plans by MHA to engage youths on the dangers of drug abuse as well as to legislate stiffer laws against the promotion of drugs to youths. I invite the Minister to share with this House further details of the Ministry’s plans to reduce the number of youths involved in the consumption of drugs.\nDadah Itu Haram Campaign\nMs Rahayu Mahzam\n:"
